The bad news is that it isn't me. — ste(screeching into the wilderness)ph (@stphfrndz) September 11, 2017  2. She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities  Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010.  Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor:  When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend.  Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini.  3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013  In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.”  Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama.  A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT  Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,” she said. “You can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.”  The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.”  4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality  While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.”  The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.”  During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above.  5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality  Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality.  The lyrics “Tell me what you want, what you like, it’s ok / I’m a little curious, too” and “Got a taste for the cherry / I just need to take a bite” were taken as an admission that she had at least experimented with women in the past.  In an interview with British late-night host Alan Carr, Lovato continued to play coy about her lyrics. “I’m not confirming and I’m definitely not denying,” she quipped with a smile.  “All of my songs are based off of personal experiences. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with experimentation at all.” Carr joked that he “experimented once and it stuck,” leading Lovato to retort:”Hey, I didn’t say it didn’t stick either.”",0
"Muslim convert and would-be domestic terrorist Everitt Aaron Jameson, who planned to carry out a Christmas Day massacre on Pier 39 in San Francisco, was a supporter of Antifa and counted amongst his favourite news organisations CNN, BuzzFeed and Al-Jazeera.The former US Marine was arrested after he told the FBI of his plan to carry out the atrocity, noting that December 25 would be “the perfect day to commit the attack” because Pier 39 would be crowded with people.Media reports confirmed that Jameson “had recently been posting and liking pro-terrorism content on Facebook” and had expressed support for the ISIS-inspired Halloween truck attack in New York. He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don’t mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‘liked’ numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‘Trump Resistance Movement’, ‘Things Trump Supporters Say’, ‘US Democratic Socialists’, ‘Progressive Politics’, and ‘Jeremy Corbyn’.Some of Jameson’s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including ‘Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, ‘Islam – Religion of Peace’ and ‘Stunning Hijabs’, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled ‘European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists’ details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses. Members of Antifa have also met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training.FBI field report: Antifa has improvised explosives stored on college campuses.

"Two years into a relationship with her boyfriend, actress Vanessa Kirby was shocked to wake up one day and find out she was married to Tom Cruise.  While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  “Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.  “None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”  “The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  “I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”  She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”",0
"Real Housewives of New Jersey star Caroline Manzo wants justice to be served after her sister, Dina, was brutally beaten during a home invasion this past weekend.  Even though the two had their issues in the past, Dina's sister Caroline has spoken out in support of her sibling.  ""I hope the police get to the bottom of this and whoever is responsible for this gets what's coming to them,"" Caroline said.  Dina Manzo, 46, and her millionaire boyfriend, David Cantin, were viciously beaten by two burglars upon entering their Holmdel, New Jersey, townhouse on Saturday. The couple was returning home from a celebration for Teresa Giudice’s daughter, Audriana’s first communion.  The Holmdel police report says the pair arrived home after the festivities on Saturday night and opened their front door to find two masked individuals inside the house. The robbers then rushed towards the two and struck Cantin with a baseball bat several times. Manzo was punched multiple times.

"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.",0
"Legal battle with ex husband leave's the star's family 'desperately worried about her.'  Despite a tumultuous custody battle with ex Kevin Federline, Radar Online reports that Britney Spears may have other things on her plate that would explain her erratic behavior.  The publication broke the news that Spears is “desperate” for Sam Asghari, her current love interest, to propose, “but he’s dragging his feet and stalling.”  After completing a successful run of shows in Las Vegas, Spears allegedly immediately turned her attention to tying the knot with her 23-year-old boyfriend.  The same source claims that the real reasoning behind Spears being impatient is because of her immediate urge to have children with Asghari.  “All she can talk about right now is having a baby. She wants a girl so bad and she’s madly in love with Sam.”  Asghari however, apparently is hesitant to act on Spear’s marriage advances, citing that he may not be mentally ready to completely settle down with the famous performer.  While this all occurs, Spears also is caught up in a heated legal battle with ex, Federline.  He is reportedly asking the star for more money in spousal and child support to help take care of himself along with their young children, Sean and Jayden.  Matthew Simmons / Getty Images  The same source mentioned that “She’s freaking out over this court deposition and doesn’t see an end in sight to all the ugliness with Kevin.”  Spears met Federline, a professional dancer, in April 2004 and, aside from the fact that he already had a child on the way with ex-fiancée Shar Jackson, whom, at the time, he had only been split from for a very short period. Federline and Spears were engaged by July of that year.  Their marriage ceremony took place on September 18, 2004, with son Sean Preston being born barely a year later. Jayden James, their second son, was born a year after that. However, by November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline and began pursuing other romantic interests.  All of the drama surrounding Spears is prompting those closest to her to state that they are worried she may spiral off into something akin to her most famous public meltdown over a decade ago when she had shaved her head amongst other media-covered reckless acts.  However, the source still described the situation best by saying that “There are still some major demons that Britney has to fight on a daily basis, and her workload never lets up. She feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and her family’s desperately worried about her.”",0
"Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones is opening up about life after his anti-bullying video, revealing that he hasn’t returned to school since the footage spread across the Internet.  The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they said they aren’t sure when Keaton will return to Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I actually haven’t been to school,” he said. He added of his bullies: “Why do you bully? What’s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.  Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video  “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”",1

"Selena Gomez is finally speaking out about Demi Lovato’s alleged overdose as the ""Sorry Not Sorry"" singer is still recovering from the incident that occurred on Tuesday (July 24). An insider told E! that Gomez, who once used to be good pals with the former Disney star ""was very upset and emotional"" when she heard about the news. Despite having grown apart as friends, the source mentions the two ""always shared a special bond and they still have love for one another.""  The insider continued: ""Selena has reached out to Demi's family members to share her love and prayers, and she is really distraught about her health. She hates that Demi has been suffering."" Gomez’s response comes on the heels of Lovato's emergency hospitalization when she overdosed at her Hollywood Hills home, prompting paramedics called to the scene and friends to administer the artist with Narcan — the emergency treatment that virtually saved Lovato’s life — before rushing her to a nearby medical facility for further treatment.  As fans awaited updates of Lovato's medical state, celebrities flooded social media with prayers for the performer’s recovery, generating the hashtag #PrayforDemi. Gomez's mother, Mandy Teefy, who has known the ""Tell Me You Love Me"" vocalist since she was a child, later grieved the crushing news on Instagram.",1
"Kate Gosselin is ready to get back into the dating scene.  It’s been a little more than eight years since the mother of eight’s divorce from Jon Gosselin was finalized in December 2009, and now, the Kate Plus 8 star is ready to give love another chance.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  PEOPLE can exclusively reveal that Gosselin, 43, will star in new TLC series Kate Plus Date, which will document the reality star on her dating journey.  “I’m nervous, I’m excited, and I’m forcing myself to do this,” Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries.  In fall 2019, her two eldest children — twins Mady and Cara, both 17 — will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.)  “As we’re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it’s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like ‘Mommy, you’re gonna be all alone soon,’ ” shares Gosselin. “But it was very apparent, now that they’re older and talking about dating and how they’re all gonna get married someday … it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.”  Larsen & Talbert  In a moment of reflection, Gosselin says she “started picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like ‘old maid’ and ‘spinster’ started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don’t want that to be my fate.”  “I stopped focusing on myself — I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the dating thing,” she says. “It’s never really fit into my life.”  Though Gosselin admits her life is “very complicated,” she won’t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding happily ever after.  “If I’m going to date someone, I can’t just go out on a date — it’s creepy to me to think of just going out somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to go on a date — a camera crew will be there! I’ll be safe!” she says. “And the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.”  For Gosselin, having her dating life documented for cameras is safer — and far less intimidating — than going online.  “I won’t be just doing some scary online thing,” she says. “I mean, online dating, seriously — I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to date, let’s be honest.”  WATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way  As for what Gosselin is looking for in a match, she’s “not sure,” but remains “open: whoever they match me with, I’m game.”  “I do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I’m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,” she shares.  She doesn’t want anyone she has “to care of,” but rather desires a man who is “self-sufficient, who won’t suffocate me.”  The TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids “won’t be my kids’ dad,” but rather “would love my kids to have a mutual friendship and respect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real friend.”  Most importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match “must love dogs.”  “That is such a deal-breaker,” says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. “People disappoint you, but your dogs never will.”  Kate Plus Date is coming to TLC this fall.",1
"If Justin Bieber is your boyfriend, Taylor Swift would let you go!

PHOTOS: Justin and Selena's complicated romance  Swift is disgusted that the pair are back together, cutting off her bestie after tweeting just last July that Gomez was ""the closest thing I've ever had to a sister.""  The ""Boyfriend"" singer sent his ex $10,000 in flowers and flew from Miami to McAllen, Texas to see her on March 7. Two days later, the ""Come And Get It"" crooner accompanied the Biebs to the SXSW music fest where he sang his hit ""As Long as You Love Me"" to her.

Maybe that’s because it needed an entrepreneur like Bailey Pryor, a New York-based Emmy-winning documentarian who also makes The Real McCoy, one of the tastier rums I’ve had in a while. It’s easy to lay it on too thick with rum. The Real McCoy is restrained but complex, a thoroughbred that doesn’t need to show off, which almost certainly has to do with Pryor’s reverence for his product’s namesake, Bill McCoy, a Prohibition-era rum runner who adamantly refused to adulterate his pioneering rums blends (which he sold from a floating liquor store three miles off Coney Island New York.) The Real McCoy offers a suite of 3-, 5-, and 12-year-aged sipping rums.

Henri Cartier-Bresson was always chasing what he famously called the “decisive moment,” that critical instant when all the elements in his camera’s frame were in balance. But he could never be sure he’d found it until he sifted through his negatives well after the moment had passed. These days, almost all high-performance cameras feature a digital screen that can confirm whether or not we nailed the shot. But with its latest camera, the M10-D, Leica is eliminating the screen altogether, leaving the photographer to depend only on the viewfinder. (Not to worry, control freaks: you can still see your shots on screen via a smartphone app as long as you’re connected to Wifi, and the actual guts of the camera are as cutting-edge as any of Leica’s latest products. You can also purchase an optional Visoflex electronic viewfinder.) The move is in keeping with a culture-wide trend towards reviving the rituals of a pre-digital world, on the principle that they can help you cut out the noise and reclaim a measure of serenity. The photographer is forced to rely on nothing but artistry, serendipity, and faith in the German brand’s legacy of technical excellence.

"A family heading to birthday celebrations in Las Vegas say they were kicked off a JetBlue flight after an argument over a birthday cake they had brought onto the plane.  Cameron Burke told New York Daily News on Saturday that the dispute began after he boarded JetBlue Flight 611 with his wife and two kids on May 3 in New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. He initially stored the cake in the overhead bin, but he said he moved it down when asked to do so by a flight attendant. Burke said he and his family were asked to leave the plane after a second attendant told him off, and Burke questioned whether the attendant had been drinking.  “She said I was being non-compliant,” Burke told Daily News. “I said, ‘Miss, have you been drinking?’ Because her behavior was irrational and she stormed off.”  JetBlue confirmed the incident to Daily News, but said the removal was justified because the passengers’ “behavior demonstrated a risk for additional escalation in air.” The company also said that the passengers cursed and shouted at the crew and “refused to speak with a team leader about the situation.”",1
"The actress is the latest to exit the cop drama, following co-creator Matt Olmstead and star Jon Seda.  Chicago P.D. is saying goodbye to one of its stars.  Sophia Bush is departing the NBC cop drama after four seasons.  The departure comes after a surprising season finale in which Bush's character, Det. Erin Lindsay, was faced with moving to New York for an undercover assignment with the FBI's counter-terrorism unit in order to protect her troubled mother, Bunny (Markie Post), who had become embroiled in a murder investigation.  The potential job change also came just as Lindsay's on-and-off boyfriend, Det. Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), was thinking about proposing.  Offscreen, this is the latest change for Chicago P.D., which also recently saw the departure of series regular Jon Seda, who moved to Chicago Justice, as well as the exit of co-creator and showrunner Matt Olmstead, who left for a lucrative overall deal with ABC Studios.  In addition to Olmstead, executive producers Michael Brandt and Mark Tinker also left at the end of season four. Rick Eid, who most recently served as showrunner of Law and Order: SVU, will take over as showrunner for Chicago P.D's upcoming fifth season, where it will hit its 100th episode.  (It also remains to be seen if Seda will return to Chicago P.D. following Chicago Justice's cancellation earlier this week.)  Bush was one of several actors brought onto Chicago P.D. after the backdoor pilot was shown as a season one episode of Chicago Fire. Bush, as well as Soffer and Patrick John Flueger, were brought onto the Dick Wolf procedural after starring together in NBC's Hatfields & McCoys pilot, which was not picked up to series.  Like Chicago Fire, which has written out at least five series regulars in as many seasons, Chicago P.D. has also not shied away from mixing up the core ensemble. Archie Kao's character was killed off the show at the end of season one, and Brian Geraghty departed at the end of season three.  This past season saw Chicago P.D. welcome several new recurring faces for multi-episode arcs, including Quantico alum Li Jun Li, Revenge grad Nick Wechsler, NYPD Blue alum Esai Morales and, most recently, former Revolution star Tracy Spiridakos, who was introduced in the final episodes of the season as a new member of the Intelligence Unit, temporarily taking over for Marina Squerciati's Burgess. (In real life, Squerciati was on maternity leave and is expected to return for season five.)  ""We didn't start off at the beginning of this season with a big whiteboard like, who can we move out? Who can we move in? But we certainly wanted to be this season, as you do every season, ready for anything,"" Olmstead told The Hollywood Reporter in January. ""[We thought], 'Let's be light on our feet. If there is any change, whether long-term or short-term, let's embrace it and use it as an opportunity for storytelling and conflict.'""  In addition to Chicago P.D., Bush appeared multiple times on the other Chicago shows as well as Law and Order: SVU. Her starring role on Chicago P.D. followed a nine-season run on One Tree Hill, and her other credits include Nip/Tuck and John Tucker Must Die. Bush next appears in the Bruce Willis film Acts of Violence.",1

Here’s what I’ve learned since,” he wrote alongside a photo of the couple from their wedding day in 1997.  “Love is Like Gardening,” he wrote. “I have learned to focus on HELPING you to BLOSSOM into what YOU want to be (into what you were born to be)… Rather than Demanding that you become what my Fragile Ego needs you to be.”  He also added, “I’ve learned to take pleasure in Nourishing YOUR dreams… Rather than wrestling with you to Fulfill my Selfish Needs & Satiate My Insecurities.”  “I have learned that Love is Listening. Love is Giving. Love is Freedom,” he continued. “Happy Anniversary, My Queen! I am forever Devoted to Nurturing your Deepest Truth.”  RELATED VIDEO: Scoop: Jada Pinkett Smith Says She Wishes Those Rumors about Her and Husband Will Smith Being Swingers Were True  In 2015, Pinkett Smith, opened up about the one thing her relationship to her husband really boiled down to: trust.  “You gotta trust who you’re with,” she told Howard Stern in an interview that aired on his Sirius radio show. “At the end of the day, I’m not here to be anybody’s watcher … he’s a grown man.”  “Thank God I have a husband who’s just a gangster partner because can you just imagine taking that road together from 25 to 44?” she continued. “You’ve got to be strong … it takes work.”  Jada Pinkett Smith (left) and Will Smith Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  The pair have also had to put up with countless rumors throughout their lasting relationship: including one about them being swingers.  During a visit to Watch What Happens Live in July, Pinkett Smith, 46, dispelled the claims, adding that she wished they were true. “I’m like, ‘Yo, I wish. I wish!’ ” she said.  Her Girls Trip and Set It Off costar Queen Latifah, who appeared alongside her on the popular Bravo late night show, seemed disappointed to hear the gossip was false.  “I’ve always admired that about you. Don’t take that away from me!” Latifah joked. “I’ve compared you to every relationship I’m in. I’m like, ‘It’s the perfect way!’ ”  Will Smith (left) and Jada Pinkett Smith Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  Asked whether the couple had any tips for keeping the romance hot, the mother of two responded, “I don’t know!”  “I mean, I’m baffled, really. Will and I just have amazing chemistry on a lot of different levels. We love to laugh together, we love to learn together, and we just love each other. We just have a good time together,” she continued.  “Yeah, I guess that’s the secret. Yeah, we just really like each other!” she added.  The pair have two children together — Jaden Smith, 19 and Willow Smith, 17. Smith also has a son from a previous relationship, Trey, 25.",1

"Safe to say, this John McEnroe-Serena Williams debate has gone from an overblown sports controversy to an entirely pointless one.  It started on NPR over the weekend when McEnroe, on a promotional tour for his new book, “But Seriously,” caught some heat for a comment he made about Serena Williams:  Garcia-Navarro: We’re talking about male players but there is of course wonderful female players. Let’s talk about Serena Williams. You say she is the best female player in the world in the book. McEnroe: Best female player ever — no question. Garcia-Navarro: Some wouldn’t qualify it, some would say she’s the best player in the world. Why qualify it? McEnroe: Oh! Uh, she’s not, you mean, the best player in the world, period? Garcia-Navarro: Yeah, the best tennis player in the world. You know, why say female player? McEnroe: Well because if she was in, if she played the men’s circuit she’d be like 700 in the world. Garcia-Navarro: You think so? McEnroe: Yeah. That doesn’t mean I don’t think Serena is an incredible player. I do, but the reality of what would happen would be I think something that perhaps it’d be a little higher, perhaps it’d be a little lower. And on a given day, Serena could beat some players. I believe because she’s so incredibly strong mentally that she could overcome some situations where players would choke ’cause she’s been in it so many times, so many situations at Wimbledon, The U.S. Open, etc. But if she had to just play the circuit — the men’s circuit — that would be an entirely different story.  As I wrote at the time, it was a pretty ‘gotcha’ line of questioning from the host. McEnroe repeatedly lavished praise on Serena’s ability but didn’t steer away from the line of questioning above, creating a backlash that Serena responded to on Monday:  Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based. — Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017  I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby.

"Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church.  Last night saw Bieber cancel his world ‘Purpose’ tour, months before it was due to end – citing claiming to be ‘burned out’ and exhausted from the months on the road.  Now, sources claim that Bieber may be turning his attention to ‘reconnecting with his faith’ and starting up his own church.  “I am led to believe that the real reason he has come off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith and he may be even planning to start his own church,” celebrity journalist Richard Wilkins told Today Extra – after speaking to sources close to him at the annual Hillsong Church Conference in Sydney.  “We know that he was in the country a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. [He’s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he’s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own – starting his own church – we’re not quite sure, but that’s the word from an inside source.”  Apologising to his fans via TMZ for cancelling his upcoming shows, Bieber said: “I love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed, it’s not in my heart [or] anything, and have a blessed day.”",0

Although they promised to “[continue] their cherished friendship” in the separation statement they released, we’re not so sure that’s the case anymore. Dark secrets have been revealed surrounding their divorce, including what they’re fighting over (page 6) and why Theroux’s rumored relationship with Selena Gomez is so messed up (page 8).  1. There were warning signs of their divorce  The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images  Looking back, maybe Aniston and Theroux’s divorce isn’t so surprising after all. As it turns out, there were some obvious warning signs leading up to their announcement.  Aniston was attending parties left and right without her husband, from her Friends co-star Courtney Cox’s birthday celebration in Malibu to Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding.  Theroux didn’t post any birthday wishes to Aniston on Feb. 11, 2018 — just four days before their separation announcement — whereas they’d typically share sweet messages on each other’s birthday.  Next: It’s been going on for a while.  2. They went through ‘intense issues’ for almost a year  Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images  According to E! News, Aniston and Theroux had been unhappy for quite some time. A source revealed that by the time of their split, they’d actually “been separated for two months.”  However, they “were having intense issues for about eight months.”  Next: They may not have ever been meant to be.  3. Their lifestyles were completely different  She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux seemed perfect for each other, but their lifestyles just weren’t compatible. E! News reported that Theroux prefered keeping a low profile, which just wasn’t possible when married to a Hollywood A-lister like Aniston.  A source confirmed, “Jennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.”    The source added, “The initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.”  Next: This played a major role in their split.  4. They couldn’t agree on where to live  He didn’t want to give up living in New York. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images He didn’t want to give up living in New York. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images  The couple’s different ideas on where to live reportedly became a major force in leading to their split. Aniston feels at home in Los Angeles, while Theroux wasn’t ready to give up his life in New York. A source told Entertainment Tonight, “[Theroux] much prefers being [in New York] and that’s been a major issue for them for a long time.”  While they reportedly tried giving New York a try, “she just never really could get settled in, she wasn’t happy.”  Next: You won’t believe what Theroux found.  5. Theroux found old love notes from Pitt  She kept notes from Brad Pitt. | Ucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images She kept notes from Brad Pitt. | Ucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images  For those of you hoping for Aniston to reunite with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, you may swoon over the fact that she kept old post-it notes with sweet messages from him all these years. Theroux, however, was unsurprisingly upset upon finding her keepsake collection.  A source told Us Weekly that when Theroux “stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” the impact was “huge.”  “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already,’” were among the love notes Theroux uncovered. His discovery left him with insecurities, which could have ultimately played a huge part in their split.  Next: They’ve been fighting over this since their split.  6. They’re fighting over the custody of their dogs  Neither wants to give up the dogs. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images Neither wants to give up the dogs. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux may have split amicably, but they don’t seem to be on the greatest terms anymore. The cause? The fight over the custody of their four dogs.  A source told Radar Online, “The custody of the dogs is a massive sticking point in their divorce agreement!”  Next: Theroux may have moved on with this celebrity.  7. Theroux is reportedly seeing Selena Gomez  Selena Gomez is 21 years younger than Theroux. | Selena Gomez is 21 years younger than Theroux. | Selena Gomez via Instagram  Rumors have begun circulating that Theroux has moved on from Aniston with Selena Gomez — who is 21 years his junior. According to Cosmopolitan, a source claimed, “Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups. It’s turned into something more than friendship.”  Next: Here’s why their rumored relationship is so messed up.  8. Gomez and Aniston are apparently super close  Jennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez are good friends. | Michael Buckner/Getty Images for InStyle Jennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez are good friends. | Michael Buckner/Getty Images for InStyle  Aniston clearly isn’t happy with Theroux’s apparent relationship with Gomez. She and Gomez have boasted about their friendship in the past, making this romance rumor particularly shady.  A source told The Sun, “Jennifer called her to ask why she had been hanging out with Justin, because she felt betrayed.”  “She has been close to Selena for a few years and has taken her under her wing,” the source added. “But Jen has clearly been offended, which really affected Selena.”  Check out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!",0

Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake recently stepped out for a date night in Beverly Hills in the chicest matching looks.

Biel, looking very business-casual, opted for a chic red blazer, which tied in with her crimson-hued Gucci pumps that definitely deserve a close-up look. Timberlake, on the other hand, took a more casual approach, wearing a red-and-black plaid shirt underneath a bomber jacket. Needless to say, these two have definitely mastered the art of matching date-night looks.  Read on to see Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's chic matching date-night looks.",1
"Ryan Seacrest wants the benefit of the doubt.  As allegations of extended sexual harassment by a former coworker came to light, the television personality — and the networks who put him on air — want everyone to know that he’s a good, likable guy.  “Throughout my 25 years in the entertainment industry, the majority of my co-workers have been women, and I’ve endeavored to foster a positive work environment of mutual respect and courtesy, as that’s how I believe it should be,” Seacrest said in a statement when allegations against him surfaced. “I’m distraught that anyone or any situation would call that into question. I’m proud of my workplace reputation, and believe my track record will speak for itself.”  While other men accused of harassment have been held at arm’s length by their employers, Seacrest has had the full force of industry public relations teams behind him.  Before he appears on the new American Idol on Sunday, here’s what’s unfolded so far.  The Ryan Seacrest Harassment Allegations  Seacrest’s allegations came to light on Monday, Feb. 26, after Variety published a detailed account from former stylist, Suzie Hardy, who claimed Seacrest harassed a coworker. Hardy worked at E! between 2007 and 2013.  Seacrest has denied this and his lawyers claim that Hardy asked for $15 million in exchange for her silence.  Hardy accused Seacrest of groping her genitals, grinding against her while wearing only underwear and and with an erection, and slapping her bottom so hard that it left a welt for hours, according to Variety.  An anonymous industry source backed up some of Hardy’s allegations in an interview with Today, and a former E! News employee told Variety that he witnessed the latter two incidents.  An internal investigation, conducted by a third party hired by E!’s parent company NBC Universal, lasted two months and interviewed Seacrest and Hardy among more than two dozen other witnesses, but found “insufficient evidence to substantiate allegations” against him.  The details of the investigation have not been made public. Hardy and her lawyers claim that several key witnesses were not interviewed, though the network disputes that assertion.  How Kelly Ripa and Other Coworkers Responded to Allegations  As Seacrest was quick to point out, a large portion of his various co-hosts and co-workers are women and many have voiced their support for him.  Kelly Ripa went on air to praise her co-host of Live! with Kelly and Ryan.  “You are a privilege to work with and I adore you. Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what a easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day,” she said to Seacrest before hugging him.  ABC’s Scandal star Bellamy Young initially suggested Seacrest shouldn’t host the E! Oscars show, saying it was time “to step aside and let someone of equal talent that is beyond reproach to be in charge.” She retracted her statements promptly the next day and offered an apology, saying she did not have all the information.  “Never has there been a more urgent time to make sure our voices are used for truth, and I failed in that regard Monday night,” she said. “Our word matters. I apologize to Ryan Seacrest.”  Jimmy Kimmel, who hosted the Oscars, also defended Seacrest ahead of the awards show, saying, “We should at the very least afford people the opportunity for truth, what the facts of the story are before hanging them out to dry.”  Was Seacrest Snubbed at the Oscars?  Still, rumors swirled that publicists warned their clients to avoid the TV personality after sexual assault allegations against him resurfaced before the awards show.  Reports of behind-the-scenes scrambling and the institution of a 30-second delay to shield Seacrest from any embarrassment were denied by E! News.  The show did seem to be a flop compared to past years though. Fewer people stopped to talk to Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet last weekend. Ratings did indeed fall.  E!’s Live from the Red Carpet lost 35% of its 2017 audience. And while the entire awards show had its lowest ratings ever in 2018, E!’s coverage losses well outpaced those of ABC’s Oscars broadcast, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  But plenty of stars did visit with Seacrest before the awards and some even offered some support. An exchange between Seacrest and Taraji P. Henson generated speculation that the actress was throwing shade, though she later clarified that her intention was to encourage him.  Seacrest’s Net Worth  For all the claims that the #MeToo movement may go too far and tarnish the careers of innocent men, Seacrest stands as a decisive counterpoint.  His Monday morning ratings on Live with Kelly and Ryan following the Oscars were the highest since he’s joined the show. Seacrest returns to host the new American Idol on Sunday, Mar. 11 in a premiere that has been heavily promoted by ABC.  The network shelled out $150 million in October to resign the Kardashian-Jenner clan for five more seasons of Keeping up with the Kardashians, which makes Seacrest about $15 million each year as the show’s producer.  Last year he also signed a multi-year deal with ABC, just after becoming the permanent co-host of Live with Kelly and Ryan. In addition to his existing contracts for the morning show, American Idol, and the network’s live New Year’s Eve show, Ryan Seacrest Productions will now create scripted content for ABC.  With all these deals, the 46-year-old’s net worth is now estimated to be $380 million.  While many claims of harassment never make it past human resources, the internal investigation does not definitively clear Seacrest’s name in any legal sense or mitigate the motives the network has to keep him on as a successful producer and personality.  Whatever the details of the E! investigation, his producer role on major shows and his status as one of the top-earning celebrities give him significant pull in the industry.",0

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s love story plays out on the small screen in Lifetime’s Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, which premieres on Sunday night.  From their first blind date to their cozy kitchen engagement, the TV movie captured many of the couple’s milestone moments — and Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser’s uncanny resemblance to the real-life couple is worth a double take!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  But what was real and what was just for show? Here’s a breakdown of the show’s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead!  RELATED: Download PEOPLE’s The Story of Diana for intimate details, interviews with family and friends and exclusive home footage of Prince Harry and Prince William’s late mother  True: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother’s Death  The first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana’s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother’s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. “I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all,” Harry told Town & Country in 2017. “This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.”  Prince Philip, Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and Prince Charles walk outside Westminster Abbey during the funeral service for Princess Diana JEFF J. MITCHELL/AFP/Getty  False: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan  While it’s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry’s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. “Harry’s drinking days are over,” a source told PEOPLE. “All of his best friends have settled and had children, so he’s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.” Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: “He desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Owen Humphreys/PA Wire/AP  True: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial  The scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, “women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.” Meghan’s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from “Women all over America” to “People all over America.” And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, “People are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.” About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, “I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn’t right and something needed to be done.  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan Confirm They Will Uphold a ‘Very Important’ Tradition Involving the Wedding Dress!  True: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date  The newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. “It was definitely a set-up — it was a blind date,” Harry said during the couple’s revealing engagement interview. “It was a blind date for sure.” And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was “nice.” “I didn’t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was – I had one question, I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind it just didn’t – it didn’t seem like it would make sense,” Meghan said during their interview.  True: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana  Unlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn’t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry’s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. “It was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” Harry said of their whirlwind romance. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry in Botswana Rhino Conservation Botswana/ Kensington Palace/Getty  False: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan  In the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren’t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan’s future in-laws have always been in the couple’s corner. “She’s been wonderful,” Meghan said of Kate after the couple’s engagement. Harry added: “Amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.” Meghan, who will be learning on the job, “is funny and serious and extremely hard-working,” a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. “I can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  False: Meghan Wasn’t Invited to Pippa Middleton’s Wedding Reception  While it’s true that Meghan didn’t receive an invite to Pippa’s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding — even if it was the post-church nighttime bash — was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious.  True: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch  While it didn’t happen at Pippa’s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen’s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen’s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be “blackamoor” jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan’s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) — and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Princess Michael of Kent Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty  True: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets  Just like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting “his and hers” jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress’s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket.  Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty; Megan Markle/Instagram  True: Meghan Met the Queen  During Meghan and Prince Harry’s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. “It’s incredible,” Meghan said about meeting the Queen. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She’s an incredible woman.” Harry then added: “The corgis took to her straight away. ‘I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at — this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: “They were laying on my feet during tea!”  False: Harry’s Public Statement Led to a Breakup  While the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry’s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn’t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released.  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Alexi Lubomirski/REX/Shutterstock  False: A Member of Harry’s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan  The character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn’t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public.  True: Meghan’s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry  Trevor Engelson, Meghan’s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar — because it’s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level,” according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson — who also works on FX’s Snowfall — and Dan Farah, another one of the show’s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, “It should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.”  Queen Charlotte Indianapolis Museum of Art /Getty Images  True: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal  Although it’s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She’s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn’t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely.",1
"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills.  It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business.  1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer.  Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often.  “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be.  Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years.  2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel.  “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains.  If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo.  The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro.  Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp.  If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying.  3. You start in with the brush too soon.  On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush.  4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head.  Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you’re applying it correctly.  “When some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,” says Yepez. “Sometimes you just forget the back of your hair.”  She advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she’s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers.  5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment.  You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don’t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling.  “A nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!” Vaccaro adds. “The nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.”  Even if you’re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle—no matter how lazy you feel. “If you're just a ‘rough dry and go’ girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,” Lopez says. “It helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.” That means fewer haircuts, ladies.  Not all nozzles are created equal. “Look for thinner nozzles—that way, it’s more direct,” says Yepez. The thinner nozzle will help blast hot air directly to the roots and get more volume in your styles.  6. You’re using the wrong brush.  When it comes to choosing a brush, the type you use should depend on the results you’re looking for and your hair type. Typically a round brush is the stylist favorite for a voluminous, bouncy look. But you have choices when it comes to the material of the bristles. “For women with straight hair who want movement, ceramics are fantastic,” says Vaccaro. “For women who want smoothness but have coarse, frizzy hair, boar bristle is key to provide the right amount of tension needed to achieve that smoothness.”  Yepez adds that she favors brushes with ceramic-coated barrels (such as this T3 one ) since it heats up to dry hair faster. “If you have curly hair or need extra shine, it will get your hair to blow-dry quicker,” she says. For volume and lift in the roots, she recommends the YS Park G Series Curl Shine Styler Round Brush ($80). “This brush is the perfect size for any hair type,” she says. “The bristles are specially made to help with faster drying and less heat damage .”  7. You start drying from the back of the head.  According to both Lopez and Vaccaro, many women make the mistake of starting their blowout from the back of the hair. It’s better to start at the temples, hairline, and crown then move backwards to the nape. That way you tackle the most visible parts first.  “Usually you start in the back, and by the time you get to the top and hairline, your hair has dried making it harder to get smooth,”says Lopez.  And if you have bangs, we’re definitely talking to you. “The front of hair tends to be the most challenging to smooth—think cowlicks and short wisps—and is also the most visible part of your style,” notes Vaccaro. “By starting from the back, your hairline is bound to get frizzy, so get the tough part done first.”  8. You want volume, but don’t give your roots extra attention.  Lifting from the roots is key if you want more volume. “If you don’t have a lot of time or you’re not a professional and you want volume, a great tip is to flip the hair upside down and brush it so that your roots are going the opposite direction,” says Yepez. Do this while adding a final blast of heat with the blow-dryer. You can also use a wide-tooth comb or your hands.  If you want extra volume at the crown, you can set the top of the head with larger rollers. Put in the rollers while the hair is still warm from the blow-dryer. “Pin it up with a bobby pin, and let it cool,” she explains. “So you get the most full volume and a nice wave.”",1

"Jennifer Aniston doesn't need your consolation, advice or Brad Pitt to validate her existence  ""I just want Jen to be happy *bursts into tears*""  ""But she's Rachael!! She has to find love!!""  ""I keep wondering when that girl will find love""  ""If Jennifer Aniston can't find love, what chance do the rest of us have at happiness!""  As a journalist covering films and entertainment, these are first few thoughts I chanced upon/overheard about the world's highest paid Girl Next Door, Jennifer Aniston. News of her divorce with (now-ex) husband Justin Theroux made headlines on 16 February, and it's all anyone can talk/opine about.  As is common with news of this nature (by which I mean one that dominates pop culture), what followed next were memes about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston now being single (hey, have we forgotten Angie is single too?).  Brad Pitt about to drive by Jennifer's house like...#JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/TRNL9LQaq7 — Jackie (@Jackieannroth) February 15, 2018  tell jennifer aniston i’m single — aidan (@aidan) February 16, 2018  Jennifer Aniston: single ✔️  Brad Pitt: single ✔️ pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz — coloradainútil (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018  Somewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her ""Hey, let's grab coffee and catch up"" text to Brad Pitt. https://t.co/pXLGo7O4Mp — Madeline Hill (@mad_hill) February 15, 2018  If Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunite. This will be me... pic.twitter.com/JflsgV9K9u — Nina Diana (@ninadonline) February 15, 2018  Brad Pitt turning up at Jennifer Aniston's place like pic.twitter.com/u4uGJ57NoO — Daniel (@Daniel_Reilly1) February 15, 2018  Me: *reading about Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux split* awww that sucks  Also me: planning Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt's second wedding — Ally Reid (@ashallann) February 16, 2018  My reaction to Jennifer Aniston separation news😭but realized both her and Brad Pitt are single😊 pic.twitter.com/RJj9UWxgxg — Hani Lee (@HaniLee1) February 15, 2018  Now who doesn't like a bunch of funny memes? But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston's breakup.  First of all, it's a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking ""thanks but no thanks"".  We are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little.  Has it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy?  Remember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""  Doesn't sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world's baggage involving her love life. Besides, I'd like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood.  Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she's with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.  Besides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt's league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.  Leo DiCaprio, single at 43: wow, LAD what a legend. Jennifer Aniston, single at 49: what’s wrong with her? Why can’t she find love? Why can’t she hang on to a man?#everydaysexism — Kelly Jackson (@Kelly_Jackson88) February 16, 2018  It’s so insulting to Jennifer Aniston that anyone would suggest she’ll get back with Brad Pitt now she’s single. I really hope she doesn’t! — Serena Marchetta (@SerenaEvelyn) February 16, 2018  Updated Date: Feb 16, 2018 17:17 PM",0

Play slideshow Getty•REUTERS 1 of 100 Melania Trump in pictures  The current FLOTUS was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia on April 26, 1970. Born Melania Knavs, she began her modelling career at the age of sixteen and attended the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia where she studied architecture. However, she left her studies after a year to pursue a successful career in modelling. Melania has worked as a fashion model for agencies in Milan and Paris and she later moved to New York City in 1996.  In 2000, she appeared nude on the cover of British GQ, an achievement she is immensely proud of and is listed on her official biography on the White House website. The website states: “As a model, Melania has appeared in high profile ad campaigns and worked with some of the top photographer in the fashion industry. “She has graced the covers of Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, British GQ, Ocean Drive, Avenue, In Style and New York Magazine.” Melania also once appeared scantily clad aboard Donald Trump’s gold-encrusted Boeing 727.  Getty Melania Trump life in pictures: Melania Trump at her Donald Trump's inauguration  GQ editor Dylan Jones said Trump requested the photographs be delivered to his office. “We framed the cover and a selection of prints and sent them as soon as we could,” he said. She met the current US President Donald Trump, who was a real estate mogul at the time, at a party in New York and they began a relationship. Melania married Donald Trump in January 2005 and a year later the couple had their first son, Barron William Trump.

"She’s doing just fine! Olivia Munn has landed a new gig hosting the Critics’ Choice Awards 2018 amid reports that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick.  The X-Men: Apocalypse actress, 37, will lead the star-studded event on Thursday, January 11, at Barker Hanger in Santa Monica, California. “We are absolutely thrilled to have Olivia hosting this year’s ceremony, and know that she will deliver an entertaining and sharp-witted evening to everyone in the room, and the viewers at home,” Broadcast Film Critics Association president Joey Berlin said in a statement. “Beyond her skills as an actress, Olivia’s work as an activist within the industry gives her a powerful voice, making her the perfect candidate to lead this night honoring the best and brightest in film and television.”  As previously reported, Munn was one of six women to allege sexual misconduct against director Brett Ratner in November 2017. The following month, she penned a candid essay for Entertainment Weekly about the “abuse of power” in Hollywood and expressed her staunch support for the “#MeToo” movement.  The news comes one day after the sports gossip blog Terez Owens reported that the Office Christmas Party star’s ex Rodgers, 34, was spotted on a date with Patrick, 35. “Danica and Aaron were all over each other, kissing and couldn’t seem to keep their hands off each other,” an eyewitness claimed to the site, noting that the NFL pro and the NASCAR driver had dinner together after Christmas at his favorite restaurant, Chives, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. “This is on the extreme down low, as they both want to keep this quiet for now. It’s early but they are really hitting it off.”  A source also claimed to Us Weekly that the two athletes are dating.  As previously reported, Rodgers and Munn split in April 2017 after three years together. According to an insider, the duo ended their romance due to tension the model had with the quarterback’s family. Meanwhile, Patrick and fellow race car driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. called it quits on their five-year relationship in December 2017.  The 23rd Annual Critics Choice Awards will air on the CW Thursday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET.

"Justin Theroux and Selena Gomez have not been exchanging flirty texts with each other following his split from Jennifer Aniston, despite a made-up report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. A rep for the actor tells us there's no truth to it.  John Lamparski / Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows  An alleged insider, however, tells RadarOnline that Theroux ""was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her,"" and now the newly-single actor is pursuing the singer via text. The questionable source adds, ""He's asking for major trouble by trying to hang out with her so soon after his and Jen's split.""  The supposed tipster goes on to say that Gomez has been receptive to the actor's advances, before further speculating that Aniston will be infuriated when she finds out. The seemingly phony insider says the actress believed the pop star was ""very much her friend, not Justin's,"" so she'll likely see their communications as a betrayal.  None of this is remotely true. While the blog hides behind an anonymous and untraceable source, Theroux's rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that he hasn't been exchanging flirty texts with Gomez. Although the actor and singer became friendly after meeting through Aniston, there's nothing ""flirty"" about their dynamic.  It's possible this scenario was created because Theroux gave Gomez a shoutout on Instagram last month while visiting a animal shelter in the singer's hometown of Texas. However, the actor simple suggested she adopt a rescue dog. He certainly wasn't flirting.  Unfortunately, this phony narrative has cropped up before. Gossip Cop called out NW last month for making up a similar story about Theroux hitting on Gomez in the wake of his separation. The pop star was also dragged into the exes' marriage back when they were still together. Last April, Gossip Cop busted a bogus In Touch story alleging that Aniston was jealous of Gomez and her so-called ""flirty friendship"" with Theroux.  It's worth noting, Gomez has revealed in interviews that she looks up to Aniston, who gives her ""maternal advice."" The pop star further noted that she's been a lifelong fan of the actress, so she's particularly grateful that they now ""have real conversations with such a real heart."" The idea that Gomez would start flirting with her close friend and mentor's estranged husband is simply absurd. Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm there's no truth to the blog's account of events.

"Oprah Winfrey was born in the rural town of Kosciusko, Mississippi, on January 29, 1954. In 1976, Winfrey moved to Baltimore, where she hosted a hit television chat show, People Are Talking. Afterward, she was recruited by a Chicago TV station to host her own morning show. She later became the host of her own, wildly popular program, The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired for 25 seasons, from 1986 to 2011. That same year, Winfrey launched her own TV network, the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN).  In 2005, Winfrey helped give The Color Purple a new life onstage as one of the producers of the 11-time Tony-nominated musical, which ran on Broadway until 2008. A revival of the musical, which Winfrey co-produced in 2015, won a Tony Award.  With the debut in 1999 of Oxygen Media, a company she co-founded that is dedicated to producing cable and Internet programming for women, Winfrey ensured her place in the forefront of the media industry and as one of the most powerful and wealthy people in show business. In 2002, she concluded a deal with the network to air a prime-time complement to her syndicated talk show. Her highly successful monthly, O: The Oprah Magazine debuted in 2000, and in 2004, she signed a new contract to continue The Oprah Winfrey Show through the 2010-11 season. At the time, the syndicated show was seen on nearly 212 U.S. stations and in more than 100 countries worldwide.  The media giant contributed immensely to the publishing world by launching her ""Oprah's Book Club,"" as part of her talk show. The program propelled many unknown authors to the top of the bestseller lists and gave pleasure reading a new kind of popular prominence.  Winfrey, who became almost as well-known for her weight loss efforts as for her talk show, lost an estimated 90 pounds (dropping to her ideal weight of around 150 pounds) and competed in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C., in 1995. In the wake of her highly publicized success, Winfrey's personal chef, Rosie Daley, and trainer, Bob Greene, both published best-selling books.  In 1994, with talk shows becoming increasingly trashy and exploitative, Winfrey pledged to keep her show free of tabloid topics. Although ratings initially fell, she earned the respect of her viewers and was soon rewarded with an upsurge in popularity. Her projects with Harpo have included the highly rated 1989 TV miniseries, The Women of Brewster Place, which she also starred in. Winfrey also signed a multi-picture contract with Disney. The initial project, 1998's Beloved, based on Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Toni Morrison and starring Winfrey and Danny Glover , got mixed reviews and generally failed to live up to expectations.  Winfrey launched The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1986 as a nationally syndicated program. With its placement on 120 channels and an audience of 10 million people, the show grossed $125 million by the end of its first year, of which Winfrey received $30 million. She soon gained ownership of the program from ABC, drawing it under the control of her new production company, Harpo Productions ('Oprah' spelled backwards) and making more and more money from syndication.  In 1976, Oprah Winfrey moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where she hosted the TV chat show People Are Talking. The show became a hit and Winfrey stayed with it for eight years, after which she was recruited by a Chicago TV station to host her own morning show, A.M. Chicago. Her major competitor in the time slot was Phil Donahue . Within several months, Winfrey's open, warm-hearted personal style had won her 100,000 more viewers than Donahue and had taken her show from last place to first in the ratings. Her success led to nationwide fame and a role in Steven Spielberg 's 1985 film The Color Purple, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  American television host, actress, producer, philanthropist and entrepreneur Oprah Gail Winfrey was born on January 29, 1954, in Kosciusko, Mississippi. After a troubled adolescence in a small farming community, where she was sexually abused by a number of male relatives and friends of her mother, Vernita, she moved to Nashville to live with her father, Vernon, a barber and businessman. She entered Tennessee State University in 1971 and began working in radio and television broadcasting in Nashville.  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network  In 2009, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be ending her program when her contract with ABC ended, in 2011. Soon after, she moved to her own network, the Oprah Winfrey Network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications.  Despite a financially rocky start, the network made headlines in January 2013, when it aired an interview between Winfrey and Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist and seven-time Tour de France winner who was stripped of his Tour titles in 2012 due to doping charges. During the interview, Armstrong admitted to using performance-enhancing substances throughout his cycling career, including the hormones cortisone, testosterone and erythropoietin (also known as EPO). ""I am deeply flawed ... and I'm paying the price for it, and I think that's okay. I deserve this,"" he stated. The interview reportedly brought in millions of dollars in revenue for OWN.  Of her interview with Armstrong, Winfrey said in a statement, ""He did not come clean in the manner I expected. It was surprising to me. I would say that, for myself, my team, all of us in the room, we were mesmerized by some of his answers. I felt he was thorough. He was serious. He certainly prepared himself for this moment. I would say he met the moment. At the end of it, we both were pretty exhausted.""  In March 2015, Winfrey announced that her Chicago-based Harpo Studios would close at the end of the year to consolidate the company’s production operations to the Los Angeles-based OWN headquarters. Winfrey’s television empire was launched at the studio and it had been home to her daily syndicated talk show through its finale in 2011. ""The time had come to downsize this part of the business and to move forward. It will be sad to say goodbye,"" said Winfrey, ""but I look ahead with such a knowing that what the future holds is even more than I can see.""  Winfrey returned to acting in Greenleaf, which marked her first recurring scripted television role. The original family drama, which revolves around a Memphis megachurch, premiered on OWN in June 2016.  In December 2017, it was announced that Discovery had become the majority owner of OWN with the purchase of 24.5 percent of the company from its founder for $70 million. Winfrey retained 25.5 percent of OWN and remained its chief executive under terms of the agreement.  Activism, Charity and Awards  According to Forbes magazine, Oprah was the richest African American of the 20th century and the world's only Black billionaire for three years running. Life magazine hailed her as the most influential woman of her generation. In 2005, Business Week named her the greatest Black philanthropist in American history. Oprah's Angel Network has raised more than $50 million for charitable programs, including girls' education in South Africa and relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Winfrey is a dedicated activist for children's rights; in 1994, President Clinton signed a bill into law that Winfrey had proposed to Congress, creating a nationwide database of convicted child abusers. She founded the Family for Better Lives foundation and also contributes to her alma mater, Tennessee State University. In September 2002, Oprah was named the first recipient of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Bob Hope Humanitarian Award.  Campaigning for Barack Obama  Winfrey campaigned for Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama in December 2007, attracting the largest crowds of the primary season to that point. Winfrey joined Obama for a series of rallies in the early primary/caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. It was the first time Winfrey had ever campaigned for a political candidate.  The biggest event was at the University of South Carolina football stadium, where 29,000 supporters attended a rally that had been switched from an 18,000-seat basketball arena to satisfy public demand. ""Dr. (Martin Luther) King dreamed the dream. But we don't have to just dream the dream any more,"" Oprah told the crowd. ""We get to vote that dream into reality by supporting a man who knows not just who we are, but who we can be.""  In her final season of her talk show, Oprah made ratings soar when she revealed a family secret: she has a half-sister named Patricia. Oprah's mother gave birth to a baby girl in 1963. At the time, Oprah was nine years old, and living with her father. Lee put the child up for adoption because she believed that she wouldn't be able to get off public assistance if she had another child to care for. Patricia lived in a series of foster homes until she was seven years old.  Patricia tried to connect with her birth mother through her adoption agency after she became an adult, but Lee did not want to meet her. After doing some research, she approached a niece of Winfrey's, and the two had DNA tests done, which proved they were related. Winfrey only learned of her sister's existence a few months before she made the decision to publicize the knowledge. ""It was one of the greatest surprises of my life,"" she said on her show.  In November 2013, Winfrey received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. President Barack Obama gave her this award for her contributions to her country.  In February 2018, after a shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 people dead, Winfrey announced she would follow the example set by George and Amal Clooney and donate $500,000 to the March for Our Lives demonstration scheduled for March 24.  She tweeted: ""George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to 'March For Our Lives.' These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we've had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.""  2018 Golden Globes Speech: #MeToo, Female Empowerment  In January 2018, Winfrey became the first African-American woman to be honored with the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Award, for lifetime achievement. In a powerful speech, she recalled being inspired by seeing Sidney Poitier honored at the Globes decades earlier, before emphasizing the importance of a free press and the power of speaking the truth in a ""culture broken by brutally powerful men.""  ""So I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,"" she said, in closing. ""And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, 'Me too' again.""  The overwhelming reception to the speech was such that many began calling for the media mogul and personality to run for president. Winfrey generally downplayed the suggestion that she would do so, though she admitted to People that the support had her entertaining the idea, and prompted her to check with the Big Guy upstairs for guidance: ""God, if you think I’m supposed to run, you gotta tell me, and it has to be so clear that not even I can miss it,"" she recalled, adding that she had yet to receive clear affirmation to proceed.  Other Projects: '60 Minutes,' Oprah's Favorite Things Lives On  In January 2017, CBS announced that Winfrey would join the newsmagazine 60 Minutes as a special contributor in the fall.  Winfrey introduced her ""Oprah's Favorite Things"" holiday list during her time as a talk show host, and continued the annual tradition even after moving on to other projects. For the 2017 edition, featured on Amazon, she became the first celebrity behind Alexa, the company's voice-control system, allowing shoppers to hear Oprah herself explain her top picks for the season.  Relationship with Stedman  Winfrey has been in a relationship with Stedman Graham, a public relations executive, since the mid-1980s. They became engaged in 1992, but never tied the knot. The couple lives in Chicago, and Winfrey also has homes in Montecito, California, Rolling Prairie, Indiana, and Telluride, Colorado.",1

In the picture, Memphis is lounging in a onesie that reads: Big Brother.  Aldean has two older daughters, Keeley and Kendyl, from his first marriage, and he made no secret of the fact that he and Brittany planned to have another child as soon as possible after he and Brittany welcomed Memphis on Dec. 1, 2017.  ""Our theory is, 'Hey, we got one in diapers and formula right now so, while we're in this mindset we might as well knock it out,'"" Aldean told Taste of Country Nights in April . ""We both agreed that we wanted to have two. I have two older daughters and there's a pretty big age difference in my two older daughters and Memphis, so we wanted to have one who's a little closer in age to him so he has somebody to hang out with.""

"Sara Gilbert.  Nearly a week after ABC canceled Roseanne following the star’s racist tweet, co-star Sara Gilbert spoke on her other show, The Talk, about the sitcom’s end. Gilbert was an executive producer on the revival and one of the driving forces to get it to happen. She was one of the first to speak out on Twitter against Barr’s tweet last Tuesday, before ABC canceled the series. “In addition to my statement, I would like to say this has been a very difficult week,” Gilbert said. “A lot of people have been hurt by this. I will say I’m proud of the show we made. This show has always been about diversity, love, and inclusion. And it’s sad to see it end in this way. I’m sad for the people who lost their jobs in the process. However, I do stand behind the decision ABC made.”  ABC is reportedly looking into ways to reformat Roseanne without its star, including a show possibly centered on Gilbert’s character Darlene, though Gilbert and the network haven’t commented on those reports.",1

"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",0

"The Kardashian-Jenner crew is expanding their annual, cheer-spreading Christmas card to cover an entire month — and keeping fans guessing with daily sneak peeks.  Since the start of the month, Kim Kardashian West and the photographer behind the card — Eli Linnetz — have been sharing images from the shoot on social media, much like an advent calendar. Linnetz wrote on Instagram that the series is titled, The 25 Days of Xmas.  On Dec. 1, Kim posted the first image: a photo of son Saint, 2, in denim jeans as he posed by neatly wrapped brown presents with white ribbon. It’s the toddler’s first holiday card, as he was only a few weeks old when sister North and cousins Penelope, Mason and Reign Disick starred in the 2015 photo wearing coordinating chic black outfits. (The family opted to not release a card in 2016.)",1
"Jane Lynch is reflecting on the life and death of her former Glee costar Mark Salling following his apparent suicide on Tuesday, January 30.  “It’s been tough. He was a troubled, troubled guy, and he always was,” Lynch, 57, told Us Weekly exclusively at Adopt the Arts’ Annual Rock Gala on Wednesday, January 31. “This is a very sad end to it, but I know that he’s at peace now. He’s in the arms of a beneficent force.”  Lynch and Salling costarred in Fox’s Glee from 2009 to 2015. Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.  “I know life was very, very hard for Mark. I think we all do the best we can at the end of the day. I know Mark that did the best he could,” Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn’t know Salling’s family and really didn’t know him, regardless of working together for six years.  “He was a hard guy to get to know,” she said.  However, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.  “He took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,” Lynch explained. “Driving into the Paramount lot … at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.”  As Us previously reported, Salling’s estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” a source explained.  Salling, who was 35 at his time of death, “knew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,” an insider close to the actor told Us.  With reporting by Nicholas White.

"For a while now, Will and Jada have said that they don’t call themselves married anymore. Instead, they call themselves life partners. Personally, I wondered about that. What was that about? What’s the reason.  But in an interview with People, Jada explained.  “ I needed a different form to dissolve all the expectations that I had of a marriage. I needed to do that to see Will outside of husband and see him as a human being. We have all these expectations. ‘Oh, this is what a husband is. This is what a wife is.’ I started dissolving all the ideas and expectations and labels.”  Will will join Jada, her mother Adrienne Banefield-Jones and daughter Willow Smith on the season premiere of “Red Table Talk” on Facebook on October 22.  The two will discuss their evolving relationship there.  “Will comes on the show for two episodes, and we talk about redefining our relationship, going from calling ourselves married to becoming life partners. I felt like there was a way to speak about that that was open and transparent. But there are still aspects that are private!”  I know there are some who will read this description and write it off as additional evidence to prove Will and Jada have an open relationship or that they swing. But outside of the sexual component, I think we can all admit that there are expectations for married people—moreso for women than men. And if you walk into a relationship believing that you and that person should behave in rigid, pre-defined ways, it can present a problem when you want to do or behave differently.  It reminds me of the reason Oprah and Stedman have never married.  Last year, Oprah explained that there was a time when she wanted to marry Stedman and a time when he proposed to her. But a book proposal delayed their plans of getting married and eventually the two abandoned the discussion of marriage.  Oprah said, “We would not have stayed together because marriage requires a different way of being in this world. His interpretation of what it means to be a husband and what it would mean for me to be a wife would have been pretty traditional, and I would not have been able to fit into that.”  Shonda Rhimes shared a similar sentiment during her sit down with Winfrey for Super Soul Sunday, saying, “What I realized is, I don’t want to be married…because I could not have the life that I created for myself.”  Marriage requires compromise. And for women like Oprah and Shonda that might have meant compromising themselves. And that would have been a price to heavy to pay…not only for themselves but for the world.  Still, I think honest conversations about what each party expects in a marriage—before that marriage takes place, could lead to a partnership where both parties still feel free to do and achieve all that they were meant to in the world.  What do you think about the idea of not calling yourselves married?  Veronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.

"A dream come true! Ray J and Princess Love are expecting their first child together.  The “Sexy Can I” singer, 36, announced the news while appearing as a guest cohost on The Real on Monday, November 27. “Love is on my mind. Love is on my heart. Princess and I are expecting,” he gushed before standing up and clapping for himself.  “I’mma be a dad,” Ray J (real name William Norwood Jr.) continued. “I’m nervous, excited. It finally happened. My first one.”  The on-off couple tied the knot in Los Angeles in August 2016. Their fertility struggles were chronicled throughout season 4 of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, and they further expressed their frustrations during the VH1 reality series’ reunion special in October.  “I don’t know the process of it — when it actually happened, what night — but it was special because we was trying for a while,” Ray J, who starred in a sex tape with ex Kim Kardashian in 2003, said on The Real. “It’s not as easy as people think. For some people, they just go on tour and get everybody pregnant. But for me, it was love. We took our time, and as we were taking our time, it just took a little while.”  The “I Hit It First” crooner, who is the brother of singer Brandy and first cousin of rapper Snoop Dogg, went on to explain that he and his model wife, 33, do not know the sex of their child just yet. “I want to have a little girl first because it’s like daddy’s little girl,” he explained. “A little boy is probably going to be a little aggressive, so I just want to be able to have some peace first. But whatever God blesses us with, I’m happy.”  After Ray J announced the news, Princess Love shared a photo of her growing baby bump on Instagram. “It’s such a blessing from God to be able to carry our child,” she captioned the post. “We kept this to ourselves until after the first trimester because it’s bad luck to announce too early. But we’re so proud to share this journey with you guys. Thank you for all of the love and prayers.”  It’s such a blessing from God to be able to carry our child. We kept this to ourselves until after the first trimester because it’s bad luck to announce too early. But we’re so proud to share this journey with you guys.

"Loading View on Instagram  Selena Gomez has taken over Hollywood with music, TV shows, and movies, but don’t be fooled—she’s still just like us. Over the weekend, she shared an Instagram video of her trip to the doctor’s office, and she was straight-up terrified of getting poked with a needle. Like, she really wasn’t having it.  The visit was for a routine check-up, and even though she’s a fan of tattoos, this type of needlework is definitely not her favorite. She might be well on her way to conquering the world, but that doesn’t make her immune to irrational fears, not being able to fall asleep at night included.  At least Sel’s hate of needles and insomnia gets us some hilarious Instagram videos though, right? This is basically us every single time we have a little too much sugar before bed.

"Three years have passed since Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton divorced, but the superstar of country music is always mending the pieces of his broken heart.  In the second part of her interview with Holly Gleason of HITS Daily Double, which was published on Tuesday, Lambert reveals why she avoided the press leading up to her 2016 album, The Weight of These Wings . Lambert detailed his separation from Shelton in the deeply personal project, which went platinum and won the album of the year at the awards of ACM 2017.  Of his decision to make the 39 Deadlock on a promotional tour, Lambert shared: ""It was going to be hell, and I had already gone through hell, it was hell to put it on paper, put my words on the paper.  ""I finally arrived at a place where I was no longer sad,"" she continued. ""All the moments of sadness were there, all the truths were right in these songs, it was enough to listen, I did not need to say anything.",1
"Two years into a relationship with her boyfriend, actress Vanessa Kirby was shocked to wake up one day and find out she was married to Tom Cruise.  While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  “Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.  “None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”  “The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  “I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”  She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”",0
"Robert Pattinson is young, rich, attractive, and very, very famous, so it should come as no surprise that the British Lothario has reportedly snagged himself a pretty little lady friend of recent, singer FKA Twigs.  That is not a typo. And, no, we did not mean to write Kristen Stewart all you Twilight superfans.  Rob and his new cutie chanteuse, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, have been quietly dating for about a month, according to a report, with Rob doing what he does best and flying under the radar with this major coupling news.  The biggest sighting of the two together was walking around NYC and even then they were sure to keep a distance from one another.  Rob is a pro.  As everyone in the whole entire world knows, Rob was previously one half of Robsten with Miss Stewart, reigning as one of, if not the, most photographed and written about celebrity couples in the world for a few years, much to their mutual and very visible displeasure. The two were the romantic leads in a giant movie franchise, traveling the world together and walking red carpets nonstop for roughly four years. They even got a dog.  Then, Kristen landed the role of Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman, directed by Rupert Sanders - And we all know how that turned out!  Lucky for Rob, his new gal pal also seems to shun the spotlight.  ""He's been taking her on dates for the last month or so, and has even flown her out to stay with him in New York. He also loves going to her gigs,"" a source told UK newspaper The Sun.  ""The main thing for Tahliah is that the relationship remains low key. She wants to be known for her music, not just as 'Robert Pattinson's girlfriend'.  Then, for reasons unknown to us, the source adds,""[FKA's] worried about being bogged down by constant comparisons to Kristen.""  Miss Twigs is an English singer-songwriter who loves bright colors, unique clothes, and crazy and innovative hair and makeup looks. She worked as a backup dancer for the likes of Kylie Minogue, Ed Sheeran, and Taio Cruz for years before she started seriously pursuing her singing career. She is supposedly dating Robert Pattison.  Kristen Stewart is an American who loves jeans, canvas sneakers, and a good clean fresh face. She has always been a very serious, and very good, actress, highly in demand since her breakthrough role in Panic Room alongside Jodie Foster almost 20 years ago. She is definitely not dating Robert Pattinson.  This clearly proves that even if someone wanted to make a comparison between these girls, they would be very hard-pressed to come up with something, save their fondness for Robby.  In addition, this also proves that everyone's favorite sparkly vampire most definitely does not have a ""type.""",0

Prior to the birth, Kate, 36, and William, 35, kept a busy schedule, with many public events leading up to her due date. In February, they returned from the royal tour of Norway and Sweden and continued making public appearances through late March. On March 22, Kate attended her final engagement with William by her side in London. Throughout her pregnancy, she has been spotted wearing blue maternity looks, prompting many to speculate that she might be having a baby boy.

"On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what’s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here’s all the gossip leading up to the year’s most anticipated nuptials:  What’s up with Meghan’s dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan’s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they’ve reportedly spoken by phone. An “insider” recently told People magazine, “Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.”  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan’s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it “the biggest mistake in wedding history.” The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan’s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were “stupid and hammy,” and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  And what’s up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.’s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry’s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.” (The two reportedly haven’t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a “shallow social climber” only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was “absolutely lovely.”  So guess who wasn’t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a “little vulture.”  Why did Meghan’s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It’s unclear — maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.’s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? “Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,” he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.” Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, “We are all still family.” We’re guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.’s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them — they recently landed in London, where they’ll be acting as wedding correspondents for “Good Morning Britain.”    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they’re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her “amazing.” Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level.” Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold — for now.  Is there any drama on Harry’s side of the family?  Have you seen “The Crown”? You have? Good. That’s probably all the intense Windsor drama you’re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list — it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill — some distant relatives who were invited to William’s wedding were not invited to Harry’s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don’t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What’s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan’s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the “People’s Princess.” Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan’s overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting — in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, “Ohhh, yes,” according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: “I think it’s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].” He then noted that they are all “stuck together for the rest of our lives,” to which Meghan added, “Togetherness at its finest.”    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man — “It could be a sensitive subject,” he joked on a radio show — Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won’t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry “just want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.” William and Kate’s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry’s wedding]  Are Harry’s exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There’s also precedent: Several of William’s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles’s then-ex-girlfriend — now his wife, Duchess Camilla — attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from “Suits,” the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls — British royalty in their own right — likely will, too, along with Meghan’s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.

"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also",0

Speaking to a group of survivors at St. John’s Church, Beyoncé told the group: “This today is a celebration of survival.”  She continued: “This church is my home. I was maybe nine or 10-years-old the first time I sat there where my daughter is sitting. I sang my first solo here and I just wanna thank you for lifting my family up, for praying for me and for being such an incredible example of what light and love is.”  Calling the congregation her “family,” Beyoncé continued: “Houston is my home.

"Kim Kardashian will not leave Kanye West despite all the rumors.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have seen their names mentioned in hundreds of rumors over the years and they aren’t slowing down. Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.  According to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an “escape plan” to leave him.  “Things between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There’s concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.”  Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Kardashian has “exit strategies” and an “escape plan” in place to get away from West. She has shown some frustration with his controversial comments, but the two seems to be doing just fine despite all of the rumors.  “None of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian’s rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it’s ‘false’ she’s intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.”  Kardashian has come out and publicly joked that West is the cause of her first gray hair.  “[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.”  That is nothing to write home about as far as divorce rumors are concerned. She also went on to state that West is doing well and is out in Wyoming working on new music.  “He’s doing really good. He’s in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he’s just focused on that.”  West even took to Twitter to post a picture of Kim with fire emoji’s as the only description. Obviously, he still finds his wife incredibly beautiful.  Rumors are going to continue swirling. Nothing is going to change on the fake report front when it comes to Kardashian and West, but this report can be ignored now that Gossip Cop has debunked it.",0

"Kim Kardashian West took to Twitter to shut down rumors that began swirling after a Snapchat video she posted last night started to cause some controversy. In the bottom right hand corner of the video, two short, thin, straight white lines can be seen on a table behind the reality star. It didn't take long for many of her millions of followers to screenshot the scene and upload it to social media, pointing out that the two white lines look suspiciously like cocaine.  “I do not play with rumours like this,” she wrote in response. “That’s sugar from our candy mess from dylan’s candy shop.”  I do not play with rumors like this so I'm gonna shut it down real quick. That's sugar from our candy mess from dylan's candy shop https://t.co/oICdPQVi8d — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 11, 2017  Image via Snapchat  For the record, Kim is indeed in NYC this week, and according to photos posted on TMZ she did take her daughter North to Dylan’s Candy Shop in Manhattan this Sunday.  This isn’t the first time a Kardashian has been involved in a social media related cocaine scandal. Kim’s sister Kendall Jenner, no stranger to scandals herself (see: the recent T-shirt fiasco, her Pepsi commercial), posted a photo to her Snapchat in July of last year of a tiny plastic bag with the caption: ""this is the cutest little ziploc baggie I have ever seen.""

Instead, it was the symbol of the Video Music Awards: the Moon Person.  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Moon Person might be a new term to people who have watched the VMAs for years, and that's because for many years it used to be the Moonman. The trophy got a gender-neutral makeover before last year's awards ceremony.  “Why should it be a man?” Chris McCarthy, president of MTV, told the New York Times in 2017. “It could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.” The decision also came around the same time the MTV Movie and TV awards stopped separating their acting categories by gender.  The Moonman trophy has been around since the start of the VMAs. When the network started in 1981, it launched with footage of Apollo 11 blasting off into space, and an astronaut planting a flag with the MTV logo on the moon's surface. “Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll,"" a voiceover noted, and the rest was history. That footage played every hour on MTV for the first five years of the network's history.  MTV's new gender neutrality reflects the music industry's push for LGBTQ representation and gender equality. And that was already seen in the early awards handed out Monday night. The winner for Push Artist of the Year, Hayley Kiyoko, shouted out women like her looking to make it in music. ""This validates any queer woman of color that you can follow your dream,"" she said in her acceptance speech.",1

"The women who accompanied President Trump on his trip to Saudi Arabia appeared to insult the host country — according to one of Trump’s old tweets.  Melania and Ivanka Trump deboarded Air Force One Saturday in the capital city of Riyadh wearing long, flowing sleeves, but no headscarves, which local women are required to do in the conservative country. While Saudi Arabia King Salman appeared happy to greet the visitors, a Trump tweet from 2015 suggested he would be offended.  “Many people are saying it was wonderful that Mrs. Obama refused to wear a scarf in Saudi Arabia, but they were insulted,” Trump tweeted at the time.  Trump was referencing President Barack and Michelle Obama’s trip to Riyadh in January 2015 in which the First Lady chose to forgo a headscarf.

"No drivers, crew or other team members protested during the national anthem to start the NASCAR Cup series race after receiving warnings that they would be fired.  Several team owners and executives had said they wouldn't want anyone in their organizations to protest at The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing race in Loudon, New Hampshire, today.  Richard Childress, who was Dale Earnhardt's longtime team owner, told the Associated Press: 'It'll get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.'  Childress, 72, says he told his team that 'anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America'.  No drivers or crew members were seen protesting during the singing of the 'Star-Spangled Banner, the United States national anthem, at Sunday's NASCAR Cup series race in Loudon, New Hampshire. Pictured is Martin Truex Jr, who won the event's first stage  Pictured at right is racer Brad Keselowski during the national anthem. Some NASCAR team owners have come out against the idea of protesting during the national anthem  Pictured is racer Jimmie Johnson during the national anthem. Some team owners even said they would fire any drivers who protested during the national anthem  Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty's sentiments took it a step further. The 80-year-old said: 'Anybody that don't stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period.  'What got 'em where they're at? The United States.'  When asked if a protester at Richard Petty Motorsports would be fired, he said, 'You're right.'  Pictured is Kyle Busch, who won the second stage of the race.

Unlike players in the NFL, no NASCAR drivers protested during the national anthem. At least 130 NFL players did protest at various games today  Another team owner Chip Ganassi, 59, says he supports Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's comments.  Tomlin said before the Steelers played on Sunday that players would remain in the locker room and that 'we're not going to let divisive times or divisive individuals affect our agenda.'  NASCAR drivers have only been standing for the National Anthem for the past 20 years. Previously, they were strapped inside their cars, reports Yahoo Sports.  The comments come amid protests from other sports leagues, particularly the National Football League and the National Basketball Association against President Donald Trump and social justice issues such as police violence.  Several NFL players, starting last season with then-San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have either knelt, sat or raised fists during the anthem to protest police treatment of African Americans and social injustice.  Last week at NFL games, four players sat or knelt during the anthem, and two raised fists while others stood by the protesters in support.  And on Sunday, at least 130 players knelled, sat with linked arms, gave black power salutes or did not show up for the national anthem out of protest.  Players from both the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars were the first to protest by taking a knee ahead of their game at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday morning.  No players were kneeling during the playing of God Save The Queen - the British national anthem.  Richard Childress, Dale Earnhardt's longtime team owner, said that a protest during the national anthem will 'get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.' The 72-year-old added: 'Anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America.' He is pictured in May 2017  Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty, 80, said: Anybody that don't stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period. What got 'em where they're at?

Petty is pictured in June 2017  Chip Ganassi (right, pictured with Dario Franchitti in May 2012), said he supports Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's comments. Tomlin said that 'we're not going to let divisive times or divisive individuals affect our agenda'  The protests came in the wake of Trump's critical remarks toward players who don't stand for the anthem.  'That's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for,' Trump said, encouraging owners to act. He added: 'Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired.'  On Saturday, Trump echoed his stance.  'If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem,' Trump tweeted. 'If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!'  NASCAR has seen four black drivers in its nearly 70-year history and currently has one: Darrell 'Bubba' Wallace, 23, of Mobile, Alabama.  At the New Hampshire race, Martin Truex Jr of Furniture Row Racing won the first stage while Kyle Busch of Joe Gibbs Racing won the second.",0

"Kim Zolciak-Biermann is used to having the cameras around her. She started out on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and even has her own show now called Don’t Be Tardy. Kim is returning to this season of RHOA and now she is speaking out about the one thing that is bad about having your entire life filmed. E! Online shared what Kim had to say about it all. A new season of Don’t Be Tardy will start airing on Friday. This show lets everyone get a glimpse into her everyday life.  E! News had to ask Kim what was hard about having the cameras around all the time. Kim did share that Bravo is really respectful about everything with her family especially when her son Kash ended up being attacked by a dog. Kim said she couldn’t do a show like this for a network that didn’t respect her and it sounds like they are great about working with her.  Another thing that Kim Zolciak-Biermann shared is that she just lives her life and the cameras are there. Most of their life gets filmed and as fans have seen ends up airing on the show. Kim is fine with that most of the time. Viewers have seen her fight with the kids and more on their show.  So what does Kim Zolciak-Biermann think is a downside to having the cameras around all the time? She said, “That’s the only real down side is where there is something like super major going on that’s kind of difficult.” Kim was talking about the time when her son Kash was attacked by a dog. The cameramen were there and filming. Kash was hurt pretty bad and had to have surgery.  It does look like Kim Zolciak-Biermann is going to let the fans see some of what went down with Kash when he was attacked. So far, Kim hasn’t revealed a lot like who the dog belonged to or how it went down. More than likely, she is saving all of that for the show.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BY8RRxzh62r/?hl=en&taken-by=kimzolciakbiermann  Are you excited for a new season of Don’t Be Tardy? Don’t miss the new season with Kim Zolciak-Biermann and her family starting on Friday on Bravo. Kim will also show up on the new season of RHOA when it starts airing.

Bush presented local officials with a check for $2 million from the Bush-Clinton Katrina fund. The money will help run South Cameron Memorial Hospital once it has been rebuilt. Former ER (1994) star Clooney quipped, ""There is good news in all of this, which is that when the hospital gets up and running, I will not be doing any of the medical procedures"" (20 December 2006).  In 2007, he was ranked #13 on Entertainment Weekly's 'The 50 Smartest People in Hollywood'.    In 2007, Forbes Magazine estimated his earnings for the year at $25 million.      Supported Senator Barack Obama 's bid to win the Democratic nomination for the 2008 presidential election.    He and his girlfriend, Sarah Larson , had an accident in 2007 while riding a motorcycle. She broke some toes, and Clooney broke a rib.    Merited a place in Time magazine's ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" (Artists & Entertainers section) with a tribute written by Roseanne Barr (Issue May 12, 2008).    His palatial estate ""Villa Oleandra"" overlooking Italy's Lake Como comprises 15 rooms, a wine cellar, and a master bedroom suite atop three floors. In his garage, Clooney keeps his collection of Piaggio motorbikes. Docked at his pier is a Colombo classic powerboat. Previously owned by philanthropist Drue Heinz, the former mother-in-law of Teresa Heinz Kerry , wife of US Secretary of State John Kerry , Clooney discovered the property when the was tossed from his Harley-Davidson motorcycle near the gates of the villa while touring the region in 2001.    Quit the WGA in April 2008 after the union turned down his wish to be credited as a co-writer for Leatherheads (2008). He felt that he was let down by the union.    His favorite song is ""Destination Moon"" by Dinah Washington    On the DVD commentary for Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005), George Clooney says that shortly after he met Grant Heslov in 1982, Heslov loaned Clooney $200.00 to buy his first set of headshots, and they have been friends ever since (and later writing and producing partners).    His production company, Section 8 Productions, is named after Jamie Farr 's M*A*S*H (1972) character ""Maxwell Q Klinger"" (Klinger tried to get out of the army via a section 8).  Lives in Los Angeles, California.      He is known for his self-mocking sense of humor. The creators of South Park (1997) spoofed his Oscar acceptance speech in a South Park episode, and his political views in Team America: World Police (2004). Clooney commented that he would have been really disappointed, had he not been spoofed in the latter.    Has an older sister named Adelia ""Ada"" Clooney Zeidler. She married the late Norman Monroe Zeidler, an artist and U.S. Army captain, who died of a heart attack in 2004. They have two children, Allison and Nick, who (until the 2017 birth of Amal and George Clooney's twins) were the only grandchildren of Nina and Nick Clooney    Appeared on the cover of GQ magazine four times: March '95, October '97, November '98 (with Harrison Ford and Chris Rock ) and January '03.    Was in a 2-year relationship with Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis (2009-2011).  During the 2012 Newsweek Magazine Oscar roundtable, Clooney told a story about working for the women's shoe department of a Cincinnati, Ohio, department store in 1979. He said that it was fashionable at that time for some women to have their fourth toe surgically removed so that they could more easily fit into tight pumps and heels. He came to know which women had had this procedure done, and he always tried to pass those customers of onto his coworkers, since he found the sight of the deliberately missing toe so disturbing.      He and his father, Nick Clooney , were arrested, on March 16, 2012, for participating in a staged protest outside the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C.    Is supporting President Barack Obama 's 2012 reelection campaign, and hosted a fundraiser for the President at his home on May 10, 2012. A record $15 million in contributions was raised.    Has been friends with Sandra Bullock for around 25 years. They appear in a movie together for the first time in Gravity (2013).  Suffers from a form of malaria that surfaces from time to time; he has to live with it for the rest of his life.      In Amsterdam (Netherlands) filming for Ocean's Twelve (2004). [May 2004]  Appointed a U.N. ""Messenger of Peace"". [January 2008]      In 2002, he made a controversial joke about Charlton Heston getting Alzheimer's disease; for which he refused to apologize.    In the process of setting the mood at his home for his marriage proposal to fiancée Amal, George programmed a playlist of his legendary aunt Rosemary Clooney 's records including the apt, ""Why Shouldn't?"" (first verse: Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by? / Why shouldn't I know of love? / Why wait around when each age has a sage who has sung / That upon this earth love is all that is really worth thinking of?).    Is very closely related to the noted Republican president Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's aunt is George Clooney's great-great-great-great grandmother. Which also makes him a distant cousin of Tom Hanks , via Lincoln's mother Nancy Hanks.    He gained 30 pounds for his Oscar winning role as Bob Barnes in Syriana (2005).    His wedding to Amal Clooney (Amal Alamuddin) cost an estimated $4.6 million.    Continues to be good friends with Charlotte Rae    Expecting twins with his wife, Amal Clooney [February 2017].

George and Amal Clooney welcomed 2 babies on 6th June 2017, Girl and boy Ella and Alexander Clooney.    A renowned practical joker, of whom Brad Pitt is often a target, George Clooney revealed on The Graham Norton Show, that he had replaced the license plate frame on Brad Pitt's car with one that said, ""Fuck Cops."" Of course, Pitt was pulled over by the LAPD.    With his partners sold their tequila brand Casamigos to Diageo Plc, a British multinational alcoholic beverages company for $1 Billion.

Personal Quotes (78)    [discussing casting choices Mel Gibson and Nicolas Cage for Three Kings (1999) before he had signed] Luckily, both those guys were tied and gagged in my apartment, and that was a problem for the casting department.  I don't like to share my personal life... it wouldn't be personal if I shared it.      [on the fact he had nothing to do with the breakup of Julia Roberts and Benjamin Bratt ] I was too busy breaking up Tom and Nicole's marriage.    [speaking about the 2003 start to the Iraq war] You can't beat your enemy anymore through wars; instead you create an entire generation of people revenge-seeking. These days it only matters who's in charge. Right now that's us -for a while, at least. Our opponents are going to resort to car bombs and suicide attacks because they have no other way to win. . . . I believe [Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ] thinks this is a war that can be won, but there is no such thing anymore. We can't beat anyone anymore.  It's not about an opening weekend. It's about a career, building a set of films you're proud of. Period.    Ninety percent of films are pretty mediocre, but they have a built-in audience and open on 3,000 screens.      Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) bombed. But I can take it. Most of the films I've done haven't done particularly well. I'm surprised I'm continuing to work.  Directing is really exciting. In the end, it's more fun to be the painter than the paint.    I don't believe in happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately...you die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your friends die. It's a mean thing, life.      We've been trying to push our involvement within the studio system, sort of push the things that we've learned from foreign and independent films through the '80s and push those things back into the studio system. Like Out of Sight (1998) isn't your standard studio film by any means; Three Kings (1999) wasn't the standard Warner Bros. kind of film.  Directors are the captains of the ship, and it's your job as the lead actor to make sure that the rest of the cast understand that by doing whatever he says.      See, the first thing about actors is, you're just trying to get a job; and you audition and audition and you finally get them. And you still consider yourself an auditioning actor. I auditioned for One Fine Day (1996), I wasn't offered that. So you're still in that 'Hey, I'm just trying to get a job' thing. Then, you get to the point where, if you decide to do it, then they'll make the film. That's a different kind of responsibility, and it usually takes a couple of films to catch up. And then you have to actually pay attention to the kind of films that you're making.    You got to think of things at their worst, not at their best. And Out of Sight (1998) was the first time where I had a say, and it was the first good screenplay that I'd read where I just went, 'That's it.'And even though it didn't do really well box office-wise-we sort of tanked again-it was a really good film. And I realized from that point on that it was strictly screenplay first. And then it becomes easier, because once you eliminate the idea of doing a vehicle. . . believe me, there's nobody who's encouraging us to make these films, not agents, not . . . we're not getting paid for these things, and it's not like we're going to make a mint.    [on making Ocean's Eleven (2001)] It was the easiest shoot ever for any actor, and we all knew it when we were doing it. We were like, it's never going to be better than this. He [director Steven Soderbergh ] was in hell because it was a really complicated film to put together. We were like, we're in Las Vegas, we go to work at one in the afternoon, and we gotta be done by six at night. Six hours of work. Steven was editing all night.    I'm a hybrid. I succeed in both worlds. I hope that selling out on Ocean's Eleven (2001) is not such a bad deal. The trade-off is, I get to go make something uncommercial that will probably lose money.    Steven [ Steven Soderbergh ] and I have a great relationship inside the studio system. We make the kinds of films we want and commercial films at the same time. Steven and I have lost a lot of money. We are way in the hole. But this is not a day job. I've got some cash. I have a nice house in Italy. I do OK.  It's true information is harder to get these days. When I was growing up there were three networks - three news shows, delivering the same information. You took that information into your home and you formed your own opinions. Now we have 130 channels. You go to the channel that plays to your belief pattern. We start with different sets of facts, it's more polarizing.      [on Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005)] I'm not a snob, I like entertaining films as well. But when you do a film like this, or like Three Kings (1999) - films that get you in a bit of trouble - it's fun to open up a debate.  [Responding to media reports that he had contemplated suicide following surgery] I think, if you listen to the piece, I certainly did not talk about wanting to kill myself. I was talking about the idea of living for years in that kind of pain. Please don't use my words out of context.    An acting career usually has about a shelf life of ten years before people get sick of seeing you. It's a good thing to have a job to fall back on and I really do enjoy directing.    I doubt anybody gets taken seriously for very long. I'll be on some reality show in about six years going, Hey, I had a great year in 2006.    People thought I was Tom and Nicole's bodyguard. They'd come up and go, ""Is it okay if I go up and ask for an autograph?' It was good. I'd charge 'em three bucks a person. Yeah, you gotta make some money off of that.    I'm the flavor of the month.    Run for office? No. I've slept with too many women, I've done too many drugs, and I've been to too many parties.    I know what my limitations are as an actor, but my strength is putting myself into a well-written part. When I get in trouble is when I have to fix it, or when I have to carry it on personality.      Here is my theory in debunking photographs in magazines. You know, the paparazzi photographs. I want to spend every single night for three months going out with a different famous actress. You know, Halle Berry one night, Salma Hayek the next, and then walk on the beach holding hands with Leonardo DiCaprio . People would still buy the magazines, they'd still buy the pictures, but they would always go, 'I don't know if these guys are putting us on or not.'  You never really learn much from hearing yourself talk.    I don't live at full tilt the way I used to. You begin to hate waking up with the kind of hangover you get from going on huge benders with your buddies. Also, since my neck surgeries, I've been forced to take things easier and not beat up my body the way I used to. I'm more cautious.    The idea that every time you do a film you're supposed to be tortured confuses me. I mean, guys who say ""Oh, it's really tough, my character is really suffering"" - come on. For us, even in the rotten ones, we've had a good time. I don't think you have to suffer.      We're the ones who talked about AIDS when it was just being whispered. And we talked about civil rights when it wasn't really popular. This academy - this group of people - gave Hattie McDaniel an Oscar in 1939 when blacks were still sitting in the backs of theaters. I'm proud to be a part of this academy, proud to be part of this community, and proud to be out of touch.  You can only get so far without discernible talent - then you either work, or use cheap publicity tricks to keep the public's attention. Paris (Hilton) has no reason to complain if she is on the end of bad publicity.    [on what makes a man stylish] For me, a sense of humor is number one. It's certainly what's most attractive. It's not the first thing you notice at 21, but it's the first thing you notice now. If celebrity is a credit card, I'm using my credit. My job is to try and find ways of talking about issues that move us forward. I don't make policy, but I can shine a light on faulty or good policy. The Not On Our Watch launch reached more than 9 million people. We need to focus global attention on the plight of the 2.5 million civilians who have fled their homes. Rather than talk about who I'm dating, let's talk about saving lives.    [on celebrity activism] You don't want to be a spokesperson unless you are absolutely committed to a cause because you can hurt it. I've been asked to help represent environmental groups. I'm a big proponent of cleaning up the environment. I have two electric cars. But I also have a big weak spot because I've flown on private jets. However, I welcome any of these dumb pundits who make celebrities out to be bad guys to a discussion about Darfur. Because I've been there and I've met all the players, and I guarantee you the pundits haven't.      [on who will win the Best Actor Oscar in 2008] If you want my honest opinion, I think it's going to be Daniel Day-Lewis [for There Will Be Blood (2007)]. He sort of irritates all of us because he's so good. I'll tell you right now, I don't like him!  [on films made between 1964 and 1976] It's 12 years and you could find ten films a year that are masterpieces. They don't make those films anymore. You couldn't come near making those films.      Had I not got the Thursday night ten o'clock slot at ER (1994), if they'd put us on Friday night, then I wouldn't have a film career. That's luck, not my own genius, though I like to think it was.  I'm protected as an actor by a really good screenplay, number one; and then a really good director, number two; and then really good actors, number three - but first and foremost a good screenplay. You cannot make a good film out of a bad script. You can make a bad film out of a good script - easily. I've seen that happen before, but you can't do it the other way around; it always has to be the screenplay.    I didn't become really successful until I was in my thirties. I can still remember sitting on the closet floor of my buddy's house, completely broke. My friends would want to go out to dinner, to get a hamburger, and I couldn't afford to go. They had the money to pay, but I didn't want them to pay. That happened a lot. At one point, I remember my buddy Brad loaning me a hundred dollars. He's now running our production company. I'm still paying that debt off, you know?    Here's your options: Live long enough to watch your friends die, or die young. Now, I'm not pessimistic at all. I'm just saying I realize that's true. I don't want to see any of my buddies die, and I don't have any interest in dying young, either. But I had to come to terms with what I'm not going to do.      I never thought Batman & Robin (1997) was going to be a great film. I thought it was a great opportunity for me. And suddenly we're filming. The script isn't together. I'm just miserable in the suit, trying to make scenes work. That's not the way to make a movie. The thing is, it took ""Batman & Robin"" to get to the point where I am now. When I got in a position to greenlight a picture and get the picture made, I really had to adjust my thinking. Because when you're an actor, you're thinking about getting good roles. You go, ""That's a great part!"" And you sign on to make the movie. Only now, those movies are being greenlit because you're doing them, and when the reviews come out, you're being held responsible not just for what you did in the film, but for the entire film. From here on in, I realised, it's my responsibility. If I'm going to blow it, if I'm going to bomb, it's going to be on my taste. So I started out doing Out of Sight (1998) and Three Kings (1999) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and making only films I'd go see. Now, that doesn't always end well. Sometimes a movie doesn't work. But the lesson of ""Batman & Robin"" was a great one.  I'd rather have a rectal examination on live TV by a fellow with cold hands than have a Facebook page!    If the movie makes money, I make money. If I don't, I've still made the movie I wanted to make.    I never wear makeup for movies and now it's starting to show. It's funny, because most male actors work with actresses who are considerably younger. But earlier in my career I was working with a lot of actresses who were my age or older so people always thought I was older anyway; and now I'm going through this thing with people thinking I'm about 60. But I'm kind of comfortable with getting older because it's better than the other option, which is being dead. So I'll take getting older.    [on the paranormal] I'm not a big believer in much of that. Everybody goes through déjà vu and things like that, but I don't really go for that stuff. I find it mostly to be coincidence.      [on his friends keeping him grounded] I've got eight buddies: The Boys. They've been my friends for 20 years. Every Sunday we ride motorcycles and play basketball together. For Christmas this year, the boys came out and there were new bikes sitting out there-new Indians for each of them. The best part of having money is sharing it with your buddies. I lived on their closet floors when I was broke and they had money and were working. They've been through this whole ride with me. So now, when someone comes up to me and says, ""You're so brilliant,"" they look over at me and go, ""Man, can you believe that shit?"" I met them when I first moved out here, in acting classes. Richard Kind , who's on Spin City (1996), is one of them. When his father died of a heart attack, Richard called and said he was going to Trenton for the funeral. All the boys were immersed in work at that point and had no time, but I called them up and told them what happened. There were no commercial flights available, so I chartered a jet. We didn't tell him we were coming. We sat in the back of the synagogue and Richard was in front with his back to us. When he got up and started to talk about his dad, he saw us and started sobbing. He said, ""I'm sorry, but I just saw my best friends back there."" There was this amazing feeling that every one of these guys had dropped everything just to be there. That's what it's like. People like that keep you sane. [2000]  The truth is, most actors I know aren't assholes. They often get that reputation because people around them are assholes. The people around you can treat people like shit and pretend they are doing it to protect you. Once, my assistant was rude to someone. I said, ""You know, you represent me when you talk to people."" So you have to be careful. And that's not to say people don't treat people badly in this business. I once had lunch with a movie producer who was completely dismissive and rude to our waiter, which told me all I needed to know about him. I know that someone like that will be nice to me right now - I'm in a position where he wants to be nice to me, since he needs something from me. But what happens if I'm not in that position anymore? If he treats everyone else dismissively, he'll treat me dismissively. He isn't the type of person you want to work with. [2000]      [n the downside of fame] In Los Angeles, there are a million famous people around, so you are left alone. They see Mel Gibson at the grocery store, so they're not impressed with me. But if you go to any other town and walk into a bar, you can never have a normal experience. Once people have a few drinks, they get brave. All of a sudden, there is a crowd of guys going, ""Dude!"" and hanging on to me. They want to buy me a drink and sit down and talk. But I've got my friends, see. I don't want a bunch of guys coming over to buy me drinks. The funny part is what I end up doing: I'm polite and I sit and talk to them. I wind up doing the things a girl would do in the same sort of situation at a bar. [2000]  I'm different from a lot of guys. I don't go up to girls I don't know in a bar and ask them to dance. I never have. Never. I've never gone up to somebody I don't know and asked them out. I just won't do it and never did, because I never wanted to take my ego, as fragile as any guy's, and hand it to some girl so that she could demolish it. To me it has always seemed like a stupid thing to do. So in terms of, like, ""Hey, you want to go out?"" I don't do it. [2000]      [on fame] Here's an example of how it works. I had never been to the Playboy Mansion and really wanted to go. When I finally did, it was for one of the Mansion's pajama parties, where I was hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jim Carrey . We were all sort of protecting one another; you don't want to seem like you're desperate. I grew up with the magazine, so naturally I wanted to see the Grotto. When I got there, I was cornered by about 15 people, most of them pretty girls. But it's not like you might imagine. Instead, they all wanted to have their picture taken with me. When that happens, it's like you're a cardboard cutout for people to stand next to. It's not like talking to a girl and getting to know her. At the height of it, when there were people pulling at me from every direction and it was at its most embarrassing, some guy comes over and says, ""Look at this shit, man! You got it made! Chicks are all over you."" Meanwhile, I was thinking how much easier it was before this. Then it was just about being a guy talking to a girl and all the other stuff that's so interesting about dating-that dance you do. You see somebody at a party and lock eyes and eventually get closer and closer to each other. Somehow you find a way to talk and maybe-all that stuff. That's a turn-on. That has been taken away from me. If you were to ask what I miss about the anonymity that I used to have, it's that experience, that slow and natural getting to know someone - that kind of electricity. [2000]  I'm a 39-year-old man. In the way I was raised, this is the time when you make your mark. In your 20s, you figure out what it is you're going to be. You do a lot of different jobs. By your late 20s, you sort of have some idea of what it is. Then you spend your 30s and a lot of your 40s making your mark. You spend your 50s being able to reap the benefits of the work that you've done. [2000]    In college, I basically partied a lot. You gotta understand. We're a very strict Catholic family. Curfew was at nine p.m. when I was a senior in high school. So I got out of the house and thought, Oh my God! People don't ever really like to talk about this anymore, but there was a period of time when blow was considered OK, like it won't hurt you at all. It was almost mainstream. All the designer drugs were OK-Quaaludes and blow. So that was the time in college for me: Drugs and chasing girls. I came from a town of 1500 people to Cincinnati. I would visit class every once in a while and stop by and go, ""How's everybody doing?"" I was still a responsible kid, but I didn't take school seriously. I had jobs. I sold men's suits and shoes and worked in stockrooms of department stores, and I cut tobacco when it was the season. I was paying for my thing along the way. But I quit school.      [on a part he wished he had gotten] The part that Brad Pitt played in Thelma & Louise (1991). It was down to three actors, including Brad and me, at one time. I read about five times with Geena Davis . I thought I was going to get it, but Brad did. The part catapulted him. I didn't watch the movie for a couple of years and then rented it on tape one night. I watched it and, of course, he's perfect in the role, better than I would have been. [2000]    [on working with David O. Russell on Three Kings (1999)] He'd throw off his headset and scream, ""Today the sound department fucked me!"" For me, it came to a head a couple of times. Once, he went after a camera-car driver who I knew from high school. I had nothing to do with his getting his job, but David began yelling and screaming at him and embarrassing him in front of everybody. I told him, ""You can yell and scream and even fire him, but what you can't do is humiliate him in front of people. Not on my set, if I have any say about it"". Another time, he screamed at the script supervisor and made her cry. I wrote him a letter and said, ""Look, I don't know why you do this. You've written a brilliant script, and I think you're a good director. Let's not have a set like this. I don't like it and I don't work well like this"". I'm not one of those actors who likes things in disarray. He read the letter and we started all over again. But later, we were three weeks behind schedule, which puts some pressure on you, and he was in a bad mood. These army kids, who were working as extras, were supposed to tackle us. There were three helicopters in the air and 300 extras on the set. It was a tense time, and a little dangerous, too. David wanted one of the extras to grab me and throw me down. This kid was a little nervous about it, and David walked up to him and grabbed him. He pushed him onto the ground. He kicked him and screamed, ""Do you want to be in this fucking movie? Then throw him to the fucking ground!"" The second assistant director came up and said, ""You don't do that, David. You want them to do something, you tell me"". David grabbed his walkie-talkie and threw it on the ground. He screamed, ""Shut the fuck up! Fuck you"", and the AD goes, ""Fuck you! I quit"". He walked off. It was a dangerous time. I'd sent him this letter. I was trying to make things work, so I went over and put my arm around him. I said, ""David, it's a big day. But you can't shove, push or humiliate people who aren't allowed to defend themselves"". He turned on me and said, ""Why don't you just worry about your fucked-up act? You're being a dick. You want to hit me? You want to hit me? Come on, pussy, hit me"". I'm looking at him like he's out of his mind. Then, he started banging me on the head with his head. He goes, ""Hit me, you pussy. Hit me"". Then, he got me by the throat and I went nuts. Waldo, my buddy, one of the boys, grabbed me by the waist to get me to let go of him. I had him by the throat. I was going to kill him. Kill him. Finally, he apologized, but I walked away. By then, the Warner Bros. guys were freaking out. David sort of pouted through the rest of the shoot and we finished the movie, but it was truly, without exception, the worst experience of my life.    When I first started out in television, I took any job that came along. It was, 'Let's just get a job, any job'. I fought to get ER (1994) and I got it and it changed my life. Then, when I started doing movies, the same thing happened. At first, I did anything that I could get. But I learned. In TV, I learned to focus on the script, but I didn't apply that lesson to movies. But the cliché is true: You can take a good script and make a bad movie. But you can't take a bad script and make a good movie. [2000]    I love Spencer Tracy . Love him. He's a hero of mine. I heard he never wore makeup, so I've never worn makeup, ever. I won't put it on in any movie. I'm dark complexioned, so I can get away with it. I cut my own hair. It's sort of still being scrappy. It makes you feel like a guy still. I still can take my motorcycle apart and put it back together again. It keeps you feeling like you're still a guy. You have to fight for that. What happens when you're famous is that you get a flat tire and come back and your assistants have fixed it for you. You'll come into a bar and it's really fun and exciting and a guy comes over and says, ""Mr. Clooney, come with us"", and they take you to a private room in the back. You're thinking, I don't want to be in here. I want to be out there. What the fuck am I doing in here? So you have to fight it as much as you can. It's possible to be a guy with your friends. You get on your motorcycles, you head out on the road. It's as good as it gets. [2000, Playboy Magazine]    [on The Ides of March (2011)] It's not a bad thing to hold a mirror up and look at some of the things we're doing [politically]. Everybody makes moral choices that better themselves and hurt someone else. And then we look at whether the means justify the ends. So The Ides of March could've been literally set in Wall Street.  That ego issue, which is always an interesting thing. What happens is, you get a modicum of success, and then it becomes about the strangest shit you've ever seen. I am from Kentucky, okay? We try not to live in trailers. That is not something that...we don't brag about being in a double wide, or the largest trailer. And all of a sudden, somebody will come up on the set--and I've had this happen, where it's like, they're upset because their trailer isn't the same size. And you go, 'take my trailer,' because, honestly, that's not what I would consider something to brag about. And it becomes about certain things, and oftentimes it is people who haven't experienced it for a period of time, or people who are trying to hold on to something...being in a trailer is not fun. [2012, Newsweek Magazine Oscars Roundtable]      [on Paul Newman 's performance in The Verdict (1982)] That was the first time I was very aware of good acting.  [on his support for President Obama's reelection] I fund raised for him [in 2008] I didn't do any campaigning. I really don't think it helps to have well-known, famous people campaigning for you, but you can do fund raisers. I'm a Democrat, I'm a believer in him, I feel like he's done a wonderful job and I think he's having a tough time in a very difficult environment. So I root for him, I root for the President of the United States.    [on working with the Coen Brothers] There's rarely a re-write on a Coen brother movie. The script they write is what we shoot. And it's great.    I'm trying to make movies in my life... that last longer than opening weekend. That's it, that's my whole goal. I don't have to make money; I do films for scale and then, you know, I go do coffee commercials overseas, and I make a lot of money so I get to live in a nice house. ... And I don't give a shit. And people will go, 'Oh that's a sellout.' And you know what? Fuck you.    [on funding a spy satellite to monitor the activities of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir] I want the war criminal to have the same amount of attention that I get.    It's hard when you get thumped. I've been proficient at failure. But the only thing you can do is say, ""Here's what I won't do next time."" I was a baseball player in school. I had a good arm, I could catch anything, but I was having trouble hitting. I would be like, ""I wonder if I'll hit it; just let me hit the ball."" And then I went away for the fall, learned how to hit, and by my sophomore year I'd come to the plate and think, ""I wonder *where* I want to hit the ball, to the left or right?"" Just that little bit of skill and confidence changed everything. Well, I had to treat acting like that. I had to stop going to auditions thinking, ""Oh, I hope they like me."" I had to go in thinking I was the answer to their problem. You could feel the difference in the room immediately. The greatest lesson I learned was that sometimes you have to fake it. And you have to be willing to fail.    I did not attend a private boys' school, I worked in tobacco fields and in stock rooms, and construction sites. I've been broke more of my life than I have been successful, and I understand the meaning of being an employee and how difficult it is to make ends meet.    When you're young you believe it when people tell you how good you are. And that's the danger, you inhale. Everyone will tell you you're a genius, which you are not, and if you understand that, you win.      I watch Batman & Robin (1997) from time to time. It's the worst movie I ever made, so it's a good lesson in humility.  [on Britain's Daily Mail] The worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers and to all the publications that blindly reprint them.      [on his marriage to Amal Clooney ] I have someone who I can talk to about anything and someone who I care more about than I've cared about anybody, so it's really nice.    [his response to the question asked by a student on Inside the Actors Studio (1994): ""When you first started out and you were getting rejected what did you find was the most effective method for you to prove that you were the right person for the role?""] That's the funny thing, you can't prove you are the right person for the role, that's one thing actors can never understand and I couldn't either what you have to remember about this is: the product you're selling is ""you"", this is the difference to any other business we're all salesmen the product you're selling is extremely and completely personal, it's you, if you're selling vacuum cleaners, you can say ""I have another one here if you don't like that one"" or if you're selling suits you'd say, ""if you don't like that suit here's another suit"", so when they say ""they don't want you"", it literally means they don't want ""you"" personally, and it hurts and it costs you something every time, the reason why actors are celebrated when they become celebrities is because they're taking risks that other people wouldn't take because it's embarrassing and humiliation is one of the greatest fears in the world actors risk humiliation every time they audition so you're going to have a tough thick skin and keep telling yourself ""I still think I'm on the right track and I'm going the right way"", you'll succeed as long as you're confident because you're also selling your coincidence, so good luck.  [describing his work ethic] When I make a movie, it,s four months out of my life. If I'm directing, it's a year or two out of my life. I'm going to enjoy what I do for a living first and foremost: I want to make a good film, secondly, I'm not going to work on a set where people are yelling, screaming and unhappy, thirdly, I am in the luckiest business in the world I'm very aware of ""catching the brass ring"". I'm very aware of the fact that if not for a Thursday night time slot on ER, I would't have this career, I'm very aware of that so I'm going to enjoy it to push the limits as much as I can, in terms of the kind of work I can do, the kind of films I can make.    I always apologize for Batman!      [2016, when Bernie Sanders supporters protested outside his fundraiser for Hillary Clinton ] Their T-shirts said, you know, 'You sucked as Batman.' And I was like, 'Well, you kind of got me on that one.'  At 52 I found the love of my life, I've never been happier in a relationship by any stretch of the imagination. Oftentimes, I feel like an idiot talking to my own wife.    Over the last week photographers from Voici magazine scaled our fence, climbed our tree and illegally took pictures of our infants inside our home. Make no mistake the photographers, the agency and the magazine will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The safety of our children demands it.[July 2017]      [on being criticized as 'Hollywood elite' by Donald J. Trump and his supporters] Here's the thing: I grew up in Kentucky. I sold insurance door-to-door. I sold ladies' shoes. I worked at an all-night liquor store. I would buy suits that were too big and too long and cut the bottom of the pants off to make ties so I'd have a tie to go on job interviews. I grew up understanding what it was like to not have health insurance for eight years. So this idea that I'm somehow the 'Hollywood elite' and this guy [Trump] who takes a s--- in a gold toilet is somehow the man of the people is laughable. People in Hollywood, for the most part, are people from the Midwest who moved to Hollywood to have a career. So this idea of 'coastal elites' living in a bubble is ridiculous. Who lives in a bigger bubble? He [Trump] lives in a gold tower and has 12 people in his company. He doesn't run a corporation of hundreds of thousands of people he employs and takes care of. He ran a company of 12 people! When you direct a film you have seven different unions all wanting different things, you have to find consensus with all of them, and you have to get them moving in the same direction. He's never had to do any of that kind of stuff. I just look at it and I laugh when I see him say 'Hollywood elite.' Hollywood elite? I don't have a star on Hollywood Boulevard, Donald Trump has a star on Hollywood Boulevard! [Sept. 2017]  [2012] My grandparents back in Kentucky owned a tobacco farm. So to make money in the summer we could cut and chop and top and house and strip the tobacco. It sure made you not want to smoke. [Norman Lear: You never smoked?] No, never. You know I had 10 great aunts and uncles on my father's side, and six of them died of lung cancer. Rosemary [Clooney's aunt] died of lung cancer, too, and she has emphysema. Both of my grandparents died of lung cancer. So I got quite a lesson in the payback later in life of smoking, and if you keep it up how bad it can be.    There's not going to be a President Donald Trump. Fear is not going to drive our country. We're not afraid of Muslims or immigrants or women. We're not going to be afraid of anything.

"Users rebel against social media app’s new features while celebrities dump platform as it tries to appeal to new users  More than $1bn was wiped off Snap Inc’s market value on Thursday, in one of the company’s worst trading days since it went public last year – and the rout was led by a bored tweet from a member of the Kardashian clan.  Kylie Jenner, one of the first wave of celebrities whose fame grew primarily on Snapchat over other social media firms, shared her disappointment with the app on Twitter late on Wednesday: “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me ... ugh this is so sad,” she said. “[S]till love you tho snap ... my first love”.  Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad.  Jenner’s tweet, combined with growing fears on the part of investors that a long-awaited usability-focused redesign may not solve Snapchat’s user growth issues, sparked a plunge in the company’s stock, which fell 6% over the course of Thursday, clearing $1.3bn from its market capitalisation.  The redesign of the app saw Snapchat move away from its previous split between “messages” and “stories”, the social media convention invented by the company but usurped by Facebook’s Instagram. Now, Snapchat focuses attention on the division between friends and publishers, allowing it to more easily promote professional (and paid-for) content, while grouping everything from actual acquaintances in one place.  But it isn’t just Snapchat’s celebrity users and investors who have expressed frustration with the new direction the app has taken. A petition from more than 1.2 million users begged the company to reconsider its redesign, eventually forcing a somewhat dismissive response from Snap Inc itself.  “We completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many,” the company said. However, it added, “this new foundation is just the beginning and we will always listen closely to find new ways to make the service better for everyone”.    The petition’s core complaint is that the new update “has not made the app easier to use, but has in fact made many features more difficult … Many ‘new features’ are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years.”  In the run up to the redesign, the company’s co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel promised it would satisfy concerns (particularly among investors) that Snapchat was too difficult to use. But he also hoped that the redesign could help fix some common problems faced by all social media apps, he told the Guardian before the launch.  “For a very long time, we have been trying to clarify, or at least distinguish, the difference between friends and publishers,” Spiegel said in November. “Like, on the Stories page, do you show friends or publishers first? Because our service was really built on this idea of helping friends communicate, we chose friends – and ultimately what that meant is that all of this awesome publisher content was all the way down at the bottom.”  Despite the criticism, Spiegel remains characteristically bolshy about the new design, telling a conference in San Francisco that “some of the complaints we’re seeing reinforce the philosophy.    “One of the complaints we got was, ‘wow I used to feel like this celebrity was my friend and now they don’t feel like my friend anymore’. And we’re like: ‘Exactly. They’re not your friend.’ So for us, even some of the frustrations we’re seeing really validate those changes. And it’ll take time for people to adjust.”",1
"Celebrity News  Will Smith has cut off his son Jaden’s dreadlocks. The Suicide Squad actor has shared a before and after snap on Facebook of him cutting Jaden’s distinctive locks and revealed the haircut was needed in preparation for his son’s new role in the drama ‘Life in a Year’.  Will captioned the photographs: “Getting Jaden Smith ready for the first day of filming #LifeInAYear …maybe I should’ve used scissors?! (sic)”    Jaden, 18, is set to star opposite Cara Delevingne in the movie, which follows a young boy whose girlfriend is dying and so he tries to make the last 12 months of her life as fun-filled as possible.  Meanwhile, the 48-year-old star – who also has a 16-year-old daughter called Willow with his actress wife Jada Pinkett Smith – previously revealed Jaden is unconcerned by public opinion.  He said: “Jaden is 100 percent fearless, he will do anything. So as a parent it’s scary, it’s really terrifying – but he is completely willing to live and die by his own artistic decisions and he just doesn’t concern himself with what people think.”  Will also admitted he admires Jaden’s approach to life, especially as he has the means to live more extravagantly.  The actor explained: “He has refused to be a slave to money. I so respect that. The younger generation is less of an ownership generation, anyway. And it’s such an interesting thing to watch, because I came from a middle-class background, but, you know, our lights and gas would be cut off from not paying the bill.  “I grew up in a house where you would need the kerosene heaters in the winter in case the bills didn’t get paid. And he’s from the complete other end of the spectrum. And it’s so interesting to me that from growing up in that space, he could see the need for things in a way that he’s rejecting.”  Want more breaking celebrity news? Click here.",1
"Nia Jax is not like most girls and wouldn’t have it any other way. An imposing figure in the ring, the WWE superstar walks confidently down the aisle before every match. The strength she exudes combined with overall self-assuredness have made her a role model for those who might find it difficult to embrace who they are in life.  Jax is cognizant of this, which is a reason she signed on to join the Total Divas cast last year. The E! reality series became a way for her to show different sides, even the insecurities. The Raw performer believed it was a chance for audiences to get a better glimpse who she is as a person.  5 Dream Matches for WWE's Inaugural All-Women's PPV Event, 'Evolution' We are already thinking of the potential showdowns featuring current WWE female superstars & legends mixing it up for the historic event.  “Coming on to the WWE scene, I was different and bigger than everybody, so everyone didn’t know how to take me,” she said. “I could tell fans were like, ‘Well, she is supposed to be a bad guy. Do we hate her? Do we make fun of her because of her size? She does some cool things the other girls can’t do. Do we cheer that?’  “…I’m bubbly. I ‘m loud. I like to have fun. I am always down for a party, and if there is drama, I like to nip that in the bud. I feel like it opened myself to our current WWE fans to see what my personality was off camera.  ""Then the new fans on Total Divas who see me as a different person. A breath of fresh air and something they don’t see on TV as often. A bigger girl kind of embracing herself and really living life without any apologies. It has been great. I love being part of Total Divas. I love our cast. It’s a different cast this year, but last year I loved the cast as well. I had a great time filming. I feel like this season is probably our best season yet.”  Jax could feel a genuine appreciation for her positive message on social media and during appearances. She returned to the plus-sized celebration known as Curvy Con for a second time with fellow Total Divas cast member Nikki Bella, who was the first “straight-sized” women invited to the event. The two took the main stage to discuss body positivity and the importance of supporting each other on their respective journeys.  “It’s a party of encouraging, inspiring women,” Jax said. “It has a lot to do with fashion, but it has a lot to do with encouraging people to be themselves. Last year, I was on such a high from it that I remember talking to Nikki Bella and Brie Bella and saying, ‘You guys need to come here.’ They were starting their Birdiebee line and including plus size.  “I told them they needed to bring a popup shop to Curvy Con because you don’t understand the reach that it has. It’s during New York Fashion Week, which is huge. But the impact that it has on women.  ""This year when I got to do it with Nikki by my side, it was on another level. We got to be on a panel. It was so cute because we were backstage, and Nikki said, ‘I’m so nervous.’ I said, ‘Why would you be so nervous?’ She said it was out of her comfort zone. It was an honor to join such influential people like Venus Williams and Gabourey Sidibe there.”  Jax was also grateful to receive a People’s Choice nomination for “Game Changer of the Year"" and recently accepted the Association of National Advertisers' #SeeHer Now Award. Her drive and passion to put good in the world is likened to cousin of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. She hopes to continue being an example for season eight of Total Divas. For Jax, having cameras around the second time around during taping was easier.  “I became used to it,” she said. “Even before I was on Total Divas, Total Divas was filming backstage when I was on NXT. I did a Breaking Ground with NXT as well, so I got a little taste of having cameras follow me with the experience of my mom coming to my first-ever wrestling match on TV. It’s pretty easy just because I feel like I’m a pretty cut and dry person.  “You know exactly what you’re getting from me. I don’t change how I am when I’m on camera than when I’m off camera. It was a little different because I was a lot busier this season when I became the women’s champion at WrestleMania.  ""Obviously, when you’re the champion there are a lot more things required of you. My schedule got busy pretty quickly, which I was grateful for. However, with the cameras there you feel like you’re doing three different jobs running at the same time.”  Jax is excited for fans to see what winning the title from Alexa Bliss at WWE’s biggest event of the year meant to her. Looking back today, she realizes what a huge impact it had. When they were approached with a storyline revolving around body shaming and best friend backstabbing, Jax recalls Bliss feeling uncomfortable with some of the things that were written.  “I said to her, ‘Look, this is a huge storyline. This is something people go through.’ Not just body shaming, but body image in general that Alexa had to deal with growing up. That I’ve dealt with. I feel like everyone has dealt with this at some point. We had to go in, like really go in on this storyline,” she said.  “We agreed. I told her, ‘Stuff you’re going to say is going to hurt. But at the end of the day I feel like this is going to be a bigger thing that we realize.’ Talking to fans and fans approaching me to tell me how it really touched them. They could relate to what we were going through within the storyline.  Former WWE Superstar Stu Bennett Building Career Outside the Ring The former Wade Barrett is the leading man in the movie 'I Am Vengeance' and among the hosts of 'Ultimate Beast Master: Survival of the Fittest' on Netflix  ""Then to see everyone stand behind me when I won the title at WrestleMania, it changed my life. It completely made me appreciate everything that we got to do. It made me realize the platform we do have in WWE and the reach it has.  “I’m so grateful we were able to tackle that storyline because it’s something that was real. People need to see it. People were questioning why we were doing this. And saying, ‘How dare they have Alexa say that.’ I sat back saying, ’Yes, let her say those things because this is real life. It happens. We need to tackle it. Young kids watch our product, and they’re going through it.’  ""To be able to see some of their favorite superstars going through it and then being able to relate. I get to beat my bully and win the title at WrestleMania. That’s the biggest moment in my career so far. It’s really cool.”  Rather than finding love and a boyfriend, Jax says the season centers more on coming into her own and becoming more independent.  “It’s about winning the women’s championship and buying my first house by myself,” she said. “Welcoming Paige back. That is a huge thing this season. Paige had a pretty rough year before she came back. She made her comeback, got injured again. She had to transform into this amazing general manager. She is just so incredibly talented. I feel like this season you will see a lot of her and I having a lot of fun.  “There is a lot of antics that go on between us. That’s the first thing we do when we get together. It becomes what kind of trouble can we cause, or practical joke can we pull.  ""Now that she is on SmackDown we can’t pull much, but any time there is a combined Pay-Per-View that is what we do. It becomes let’s get together and wreak some havoc. This season I feel like there is a lot of stuff, but my personal favorite is Paige is coming back and everyone gets to see the journey she has gone through. They get to see how strong she is and all the things she had to overcome to get where she is today.”  Jax couldn’t be prouder with the recent steps forward taken by WWE for the female roster. She has enjoyed watching the second annual Mae Young Classic. Perhaps scoping out future opponents.  “I saw a little of it because I wanted to hear my Renee [Young] and Beth [Phoenix] on there,” Jax said.  “I’m pretty impressed with Toni Storm. I like her style. The one football marking she puts under her eye. It’s like she is ready to go. She has a cool style about her. It’s so cool to see something like the Mae Young Classic. These women are such a diverse group. I feel like even in WWE it’s the most diverse roster it has ever been.  “Then to see all these other women just kicking butt. These girls are not only working hard in the Mae Young Classic, but they are working year-round and get to showcase it here in WWE and the Network.  ""It’s so cool to watch because it’s not only inspiring us to see what is up-and-coming with the next generation of WWE but inspires us to get better and continue what we are doing. Keep pushing on and break the glass ceilings and break the molds and realize that there is no limit to what we can do.”  On the horizon is the inaugural all-women’s Pay-Per-View Evolution on October 28. When the announcement was made, she had one dream match in mind.  “I thought it would be cool if me and my cousin Tamina teamed up against Beth and Nattie,” Jax said. “Four powerful women and two powerhouse teams against each other.”  After losing the women’s championship earlier in the summer, Jax has been relatively off TV recovering from ailments and training to be back better than ever.  Though viewers didn't have to wait that much longer for the irresistible force to return. She began the comeback on Raw after Hell in a Cell teaming with Ember Moon just in time for the build to the historic all-women's PPV.  “I’ll be at Evolution for sure,” Jax said. “Now people are saying I’m doing so well, I feel I owe it to them to keep it up. The pressure. I got to go get it back from Ronda.”  Total Divas, Season 8 premiere Wednesday, September 19, 9/8c, E!",1
"An architect who is owed $13,000 by Teresa and Joe Giudice has spoken of his anger at the lavish display of wealth that welcomed the criminal Real Housewife of New Jersey home on the day she got out of prison.  Teresa, 43, was freed yesterday having served 11 and a half months of a 15 months sentence after pleading guilty to fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud last March.  And, along with the Welcome Home sign, a brand new 2016 Lexus LX570 was awaiting her arrival from Danbury Prison Connecticut.  The luxury SUV, which is worth at least $90,000, was sitting in the driveway of the couple's imposing New Jersey mansion with a red ribbon on top.  Now architect John Fellgraff, 73, who worked for the couple some eight years ago has told Daily Mail Online that he has yet to see a cent of the $13,000 he billed them and that he intends to initiate legal proceedings in an attempt to claim it.  SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO  Early Christmas present: Teresa Giudice had this brand-new Lexus SUV waiting for her outside her New Jersey mansion when she returned home from prison Wednesday after 11 months  Ca-ching! The car, a 2016 Lexus LX570, retails for just under $90,000, raising some questions about the true state of the Giudices' fiances  Guess who? Teresa, dressed in a stylish peplum-enhanced leather jacket, blue jeans and knee-high black boots, looked overjoyed to be home with her family again after a long absence  Mom's home: Teresa's girls rushed into her arms as she made her big entrance Wednesday, with Bravo cameras rolling  Joe Giudice patiently waited his turn to greet his long-absent wife home as she was swarmed by her adoring kids  Victim: Architect John Fellgraff was commissioned by Joe Giudice but never saw a cent  Addressing speculation as to how the couple, who infamously claimed bankruptcy, could afford the excessive present, Teresa's attorney James J Leonard Jr told Entertainment Tonight: 'They make money.'  Speaking to People he would say only, 'She needs a car. End of story – just like anyone else who needs a car.'  But it is not the end of the story for Mr Fellgraff who has branded the brash Christmas gift as 'offensive' and said: 'It's hard to see all that. I'd love to buy my wife a new Lexus for Christmas. That car costs more than they owe me – it's a lot of money.  'Yes I feel angry towards them. It's ridiculous. It's offensive. I haven't initiated the process yet but I intend to in the next week or so to take legal action and see if we can get something out of them.'  Mr Fellgraff was employed by Joe, 44, to design some modifications and an addition on the couple's New Jersey mansion. He was also asked to design a completely new house to be built on an empty lot owned by Joe.  He said: 'I did plans for modifications to that house and to an addition. I didn't do the final drawings that make it look like a miniature castle. I wouldn't want to put my name to that. But we did do the original working drawings and they proceeded with the construction from those drawings.  'And in addition, down the street from where they lived Joe had an empty lot and we designed and did drawings for a speculative house on that site.  'I think our billing was about $13,000 and we've never received a penny of it.'  According to Mr Fellgraff the drawings and design for the mansion constituted about six months work with the new home taking around two months.  He and wife, Judith, pursued the Giudice's for payments on a twice-monthly basis but received no payment.  He must have missed her! Joe Giudice nearly swept his wife off her feet and gave her a passionate kiss in the middle of their kitchen  After 11 months apart, Mr and Mrs Giudice clearly have a lot of catching up to do before Joe heads to prison in March  Reunited, and it feels so good: Teresa received a big group hug from her husband Joe Giudice and her girls, Gia, Milania, Gabriella and Audriana  All smiles: The Giudice clan locked Teresa in a warm embrace, with her youngest daughters jockeying to give her a kiss  Locking lips: Teresa and Joe evidently couldn't keep their hands off each other, even with their daughters vying for their mother's attention  Kids these days... One of Teresa's girls seemed distracted by her cellphone, even though she hadn't seen her mom in nearly a year  Getting comfortable: Eventually, Teresa kicked off her boots and got a plastic cup of water from the kitchen  Back to the routine: Joe Giudice feeds the family pets Thursday morning, a day after his wife's release from prison  Keeping it clean: Mr Giudice, who will be heading to prison in March, is seen her cleaning up after the two pooches in the yard  The New Jersey businessman is pictured bending down to pick up after his two pooches. There was no sign of Teresa in the yard  Their decision to sue the Giudices coincided with the couple declaring themselves bankrupt in 2009.  Mr Fellgraff explained: 'We figured that's the end of that. But subsequently they were found guilty of falsifying their bankruptcy claim so now I'm thinking, 'What the heck? Maybe I'll try it again.'  Teresa and Joe filed their fraudulent bankruptcy claim on 29 October 2009. In it they admitted to running up debts amounting to a staggering $11million.  Among the many false claims the later admitted to making they confessed to not disclosing assets and failing to mention Teresa's earnings from the Real Housewives of New Jersey at all.  And among the banks and credit card companies is a smattering of private individuals and family run companies that fell victim to their flagrant disregard for settling bills.  Mr Fellgraff is just one of many left out of pocket and incensed by the opulent lifestyle enjoyed by the couple that claimed to be broke.  The couple finally withdrew their petition in 2011 in a move that turned out to be too late to evade justice for the fraud they had tried to perpetrate.  A 39 count federal indictment was handed down in July 2013. Among the allegations was the claim that Teresa had failed to disclose her Real Housewives income despite the fact that both she and Joe had signed agreements in the summer of 2009 to appear on the Bravo show for $110,000.  Speaking at the time US Attorney Paul Fishman said: 'The indictment returned [by a grand jury] today alleges the Giudices lied to the bankruptcy court, to the IRS and to a number of banks.'  He added: 'Everyone has an obligation to tell the truth when dealing with the courts, paying their taxes and applying for loans or mortgages. That's reality.'  Beach wear: With temperatures in the Tri-State area in the 70s, Joe opted for a casual ensemble of shorts, a tank top and slippers  Ready to go: Mrs Giudice, 43, is seen carrying a pair of bags as she exits the Danbury Prison where she has spent the last year  She'll be home for Christmas: Teresa Giudice sits in the backseat of an SUV driven by her lawyer immediately after her release from the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, Wednesday  Entourage: The 43 year old was driven home by her attorney James Leonard Jr in a black SUV along with a convoy of four similar vehicles  A high profile case followed ending last March when both plead guilty to various counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud with sentencing taking place last October.  Teresa was sentenced to 15 months and Joe to 41 months in prison. He will begin his sentence in March.  They still owe the state of New Jersey more than $200,000 in court-ordered restitution on charges of conspiracy and fraud. And just last month the IRS issued the Giudices with a $551, 563.00 lien for nine years of unpaid taxes.  Shaking his head Mr Fellgraff dismissed the notion that justice had been done when it comes to the Giudice's financial dealings.  He said: 'I just don't understand it. They're living in this great big mansion supposedly living this extravagant life but they owe all these people all this money.  'The whole thing I don't understand. The whole process allowing them to serve separate times so that somebody can be home for the kids. If it was you or me who'd done it they wouldn't have cared.  'Then I read that about a week ago that show, The Real Housewives of New Jersey, signed her up again for $1million.'  He added: 'The way I see it it should be simple. I did my job. I did it properly and they've got to pay for it.'  The car is a symbol of Teresa's return to life - but its purchase has a further irony that the family already have at least one car which Joe cannot legally use, as he is banned from driving after 39 separate license suspensions.  Deck the halls: The Giudice family made sure their mansion was thoroughly decked with festive Christmas decorations in time for Teresa's homecoming on Wednesday  Signs of affection: Teresa Giudice was greeted with a pair of handmade posters taped to the front doors of her palatial home. The signs read, 'We Missed You' and 'We Love You'  Was she on the 'Nice' list? Giudice's lawyer joked with reporters that 'maybe Santa Clause' got Teresa this black $90,000 Lexus  Motorcade: A string of SUVs, cars and news vans are seen outside the Giudices' mansion on the morning of her release  Special touches: Teresa's girls adorned the interior of their lavish home with more signs and posters welcoming her home  Touching: The Giudice girls described their mom as 'kind, loving, amazing, awesome, cool, fashionable, and the most wonderful person on the hole [sic] world'  He was told by a local judge that he would go straight to prison if he so much as backed the car out of the driveway, making the Lexus purchase all the less necessary.  A source told the New York Post's Page Six that the Giudices have a payment schedule in place that is meant to leave them with just enough money to cover the bare necessities, such as food and shelter. Teresa remains in home confinement until February 5.  At a press conference held following Teresa's release from jail, her attorney said he did not know who bought the black Lexus for his client and joked that 'maybe Santa Claus' was the mystery benefactor.  The lawyer said Teresa was looking forward to spending a 'nice, quiet, low-key holiday' with her family, reported the New York Daily News.  'She kept saying how surreal this was — that she went to bed last night in Danbury and before the sun came up, she's at home,' Leonard said. 'Very emotional. Very powerful. Something special.'  Cameras were rolling Wednesday as Teresa crossed the threshold of her Towaco, New Jersey, mansion for the first time in nearly a year and was greeted by her ecstatic family - husband Joe and their four daughters.

Pictured, the Federal Correctional Institution early this morning  Fallen: Teresa Giudice has had to put her fame to one side since her fraud conviction. Her last appearance on the series was in a reunion episode with Melissa Gorga  A series of photos shot inside the Giudices' extravagant home decked with festive Christmas decorations show Joe - wearing a sleeveless top which showed his tattoos - nearly sweeping his slender wife off her feet and planting a passionate kiss on her lips in the middle of their kitchen.  The couple's children - Gia, 14, Gabriella, 10, Milania, 9, and Audriana, 6 – showered their long-absent mother with kisses and hugs, and the mother-of-four seemed overjoyed to be home with her family again.  In preparation for her long-awaited homecoming, the girls decorated the family mansion with homemade signs and posters saying 'We Missed You' and 'We Love You.'  On Thursday, the Giudice family appeared to have settled back into their routine, with Joe being photographed feeding his two dogs and then cleaning up after them in the yard.  Early Wednesday morning, Teresa was met at the prison by her lawyer, James Leonard Jr, who drove her to her mansion in New Jersey in a black SUV accompanied by a convoy of other SUVs, with Christmas songs blasting from the radio.  The source claimed that her husband Joe was 'anxiously' waiting in the driveway for her arrival. Teresa arrived at home around 7.30am to welcoming signs hanging on the front door, including one that said: 'We missed you.' Her 14-year-old daughter Gia tweeted her delight, writing 'welcome home' alongside a beaming face emoji.",0

Last month, reports surfaced from multiple outlets that Thompson was cheating on his nine-months pregnant baby mama Khloé Kardashian. More video later surfaced, revealing that Thompson is a serial cheater, and probably fooled around with at least five women not named Khloé.  The reality TV star recently gave birth to their first baby girl, True Thompson, and is reportedly attempting to make things work, but Kim is definitely not here for it. ""Like I don't even know how to describe it besides it's just so fucked up,"" she told Ellen DeGeneres last week.

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",1
"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been favorite tabloid fodder lately, with rumors that the couple is no longer happy and headed for a breakup. Now the gossip mags are having a field day over reports that DeGeneres and de Rossi had a food fight in a restaurant.  British tabloid OK! Magazine reported the breakup rumors in the wake of the couple selling their $45 million dollar Santa Barbara home and $7 million condo in Beverly Hills.  Gossip Cop is debunking the claims of a fight over food, reporting that the National Enquirer is claiming the couple blew up at one another because de Rossi only ordered soup. It argues that DeGeneres carefully watches everything she eats. The report has been picked up by Radar Online as well.  Gossip Cop calls bunk on that claim:  An actual DeGeneres confidante assures us the entire report is “false.” The talk show host did not get into a fight with de Rossi over food. The Enquirer cooked up this fabricated dish.  DeGeneres disputed rumors that she and de Rossi were breaking up in October, saying they couldn’t be further from the truth, that she can’t imagine not being married ,and calling her wife her best friend.

"Princess Eugenie’s engagement announcement caused a right royal stir on Monday — and so did her unusual ring.  The pink padparadsha sapphire, surrounded by diamonds, is similar in style to the ruby engagement ring her dad, Prince Andrew, gave to Sarah Ferguson when he proposed in 1986.  Eugenie, 27, announced she would wed James Brooksbank this autumn in the Windsor venue that will see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot in May.  But that doesn’t mean she’ll be overshadowed by the wedding of the year — and the price of her sparkler proves it.  The gem expert from British TV show “Posh Pawn” has estimated the value of Eugenie’s ring at $140,000 — double the estimated value of Markle’s.  The three-diamond ring that Prince Harry’s fiancee wears is estimated to be worth around $70,000.  Gemologist Deborah Papas, from Prestige Pawnbrokers, told the Sun Online: “Like her mother, the Duchess of York and indeed Princess Diana, Eugenie’s ring has a center oval precious gemstone and this one certainly has not disappointed.  “It is a padparadscha sapphire surrounded by 10 brilliant cut diamonds and two pear cut diamonds to give an edge to the standard classic cluster.  “Padparadscha is the name given to the corundum gem that bears a mixture of red and yellow, a sort of cross between a ruby and yellow sapphire.  “This beautiful gem is considered amongst the rarest and most valuable of all the corundum varieties.  “With its carefully faceted cut and the set off with the whitest of white diamonds, this ring could easily be worth over £100,000 [$140,000].  “Padparadscha sapphires are amongst the rarest and most valuable depending on quality and a little bit of difference in quality can mean a big difference in price.”  Papas admits that estimating such a valuable gem is difficult without full access but adds: “We estimate it to be in excess of £100,000 [$140,000].”  The princess has dated the 31-year-old party organizer for six years, and her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, said they were delighted with the news.  Royal insider Dickie Arbiter revealed that the princess’s marriage to the 31-year-old would be even more star-studded than Markle’s — and the role that Sarah Ferguson would play at the nuptials.

"A coparenting nightmare! Maci Bookout confessed during part one of the Teen Mom OG reunion episode that she believes Ryan Edwards is doing drugs. The two wouldn’t even get along to talk out their problems on stage during the explosive episode that aired on MTV on Monday, April 16. Also, Catelynn Lowell talked about her suicidal thoughts and treatment while Amber Portwood admitted to relapsing after her breakup from Matt Baier. Check out the biggest moments from the dramatic reunion below.  Maci Thinks Ryan Is Using Again  Maci and Ryan each got their chance to talk about yet another tumultuous year attempting to coparent. Maci has been asking her ex to take a drug test nearly all season so he could see their child, but said she doesn’t believe he is clean.  However, Ryan completely disagrees. “I wonder if she believes the lies she tells?” Ryan muttered backstage.  He talked about his struggle with rehab, admitting that he ended his treatment early and hasn’t really done any post-rehab therapy to help control his addiction. “I didn’t know how I was going to get out and actually stay clean,” Ryan said.  When it was time for the two to come together onstage, Ryan wouldn’t have any of it. “I’m not sitting out here with her,” he said. Hopefully, he calms down during part two so they can try to work out some of their problems.  Amber Discussed Her Relapse  Amber Skyped in to talk about her life, including her dramatic breakup from Matt. She was in such a dark place after being “mentally and physically” abused by him for years that she stumbled in her sobriety and started drinking again. “I definitely was trying to drown my sorrows,” Amber said.  Also, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. “He really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,” Amber said. “If it wasn’t for Andrew, I don’t even know if I would be here right now.”  Catelynn and Maci Diss Farrah  Maci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham‘s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar.  “I feel like she’s always wanted to go down the direction she’s going down so if that’s what she wants to do then that’s probably what she needs to stay doing,” Catelynn said.  Maci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much “nicer” to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also “weren’t really allowed” to talk to Farrah’s daughter. Someone is still bitter!  Catelynn Talks About Her Depression  Catelynn discussed her difficult year — her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family. The hardest part for her was thinking about everything she put her daughter, Novalee, through this season.  “When I was in treatment, I struggled with the fact that ‘Am I putting her through the same stuff that my parents put me through?'” Catelynn cried.  She also added that since she returned from treatment, her daughter is constantly scared her mom is going to leave her. “It breaks my heart,” Catelynn said.

"How will Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split up their empire?  Splash News Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: In happier times.  There's one thing Hollywood couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt liked to collect during their now-defunct decade long relationship. And no, it wasn't children.  It was houses. They currently own one for each child (six), with a spare for guests or their shoes or whatever you need a seventh home for.  The couple brought significant assets to the union and have only added more, including a charity which was responsible for helping rebuild in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, giving them a combined net worth of about US$400 million (NZ$547m).  Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in happier times.  So now that their love is kaput, who gets which palatial abode? Who'll take over the foundation? And more importantly, who gets their ridiculous English Bulldog and renowned Johnny Depp leg-humper, Jacques?

Brad lived there with Jennifer Aniston during their marriage - but will he give it up for Angelina Jolie and the kids?  The Jolie-Pitts have seven houses in various spots around the world, but the family home is a sprawling Craftsman style home in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, that Brad Pitt had previously lived in with jilted ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston.  While his prior ownership of the home might suggest Pitt will keep the home in this divorce too, it's been extensively remodelled for the kids and now includes a huge swimming pool, park land, and an area for dirtbike-riding – something his son Maddox enjoys.  Maybe Angie will want to keep things as normal as possible for her brood in the Los Feliz house, or perhaps she'll want to ship them out to France – her ancestral and spiritual home – where the couple owns the frankly enormous Chateau Miraval.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval, the US$60m estate which is owned by actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Costing about US$60m and boasting a 30-acre vineyard (famous for a rose called ""Pink Floyd"") and 35 bedrooms (just how many kids did these guys want?), Pitt and Jolie were married in the chateau's chapel in August, 2014.  So, maybe it won't be high on Jolie's list of places to lie low until the news cycle has rolled over them. Perhaps the beach then if it's privacy the divorcees are after?  That's doable, since the pair have what passes for a bach in Hollywood up the coast in Santa Barbara. It comes with 11 acres of land around it and a private beach in front of it, for max seclusion.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval.  Pitt bought it in 2000 for US$4m, in recent years the family has used it mainly as a holiday home. But maybe he'll head up there to lick his wounds?  Pitt's also the reluctant owner of a villa in New Orleans that he's been trying to offload since 2015.  The pair bought the five-bed-five-bath home to live in while Pitt was in Nola filming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's on the market now for the bargain basement price of US$5.5m.  Ray Tamarra Brad Pitt greets a friend from his New Orleans balcony on May 17, 2014 in New Orleans.  Then there's also Jolie's Laurel Canyon home, and an apartment in New York's Waldorf Astoria building.    THE FOUNDATION  The pair started the Jolie-Pitt Foundation together in 2006. However it seems most likely to be Jolie who'll take over the running of the charity.  The Foundation has donated to various causes including the Hurricane Katrina and Joplin tornado rebuilds; children's health centres in Ethiopia and Cambodia; the Na'an ku se Foundation in Namibia; GlobaL Action for Children; the HALO Trust and Doctors Without Borders.  But it's Jolie who puts her money (and her time) where her mouth is most often as a UN Goodwill ambassador, Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award winner and vocal crusader for children and women.    THE FILM COMPANY  Plan B Entertainment was the brainchild of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, that Brad took custody of in the divorce.  To date, it's been responsible for a huge range of films, from gritty horror World War Z to Oscar-winning marvels Selma and 12 Years a Slave.  Pitt is the sole owner of the company, but could Jolie angle for a piece of that cinematic pie in the settlement?    THE DOG  Jacques must be getting on in years. While he was often papped out and about with the Jolie Pitt kids, he's not been spotted out a lot lately.  But if the baggy-faced mutt is still kicking round, this picture of Jacques with Brad from 2012 should clear up who the old growler belongs to.  - Stuff",0
"Orlando Bloom is a popular British actor and heartthrob known for his roles in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.  Who Is Orlando Bloom? Born on January 13, 1977, in Canterbury, England, Orlando Bloom studied acting as a child before he was cast as the heroic Legolas in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bloom also found major success starring in three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp. He's landed other roles in big-screen fare, including Troy, Elizabethtown and The Three Musketeers. Orlando Bloom (Photo: WireImage)  Movies  'The Lord of the Rings' Days before his graduation, Bloom was cast in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The first film of the trilogy, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring, was a huge blockbuster and critical success. Bloom went on to perform in the two Ring follow-ups; he plays Legolas Greenleaf, a long-haired immortal elf who balances refinement and wisdom with sharp archery and camaraderie, throughout the popular film series. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' Franchise After garnering a noted role in Black Hawk Down (2001), another big part was on the horizon for Bloom. In 2003 he starred as the sensitive Will Turner in the Disney action/adventure The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, alongside Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Pirates marked another huge world blockbuster for Bloom, who would go on to star in the next two sequels of the franchise: Dead's Man Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007). ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Troy,' 'Elizabethtown' Bloom continued doing period work, playing Paris in the 2004 film Troy, which also stars Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. The following year, the actor was featured as a leading man in two films: Ridley Scott's Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven and Cameron Crowe's drama Elizabethtown (both released in 2005). Then, in 2006, Bloom appeared with actress Zoe Saldana in the thriller Haven, which he also co-produced. In between his more high-profile Hollywood work, Bloom has starred in indie fare like Ned Kelley (2003) and New York, I Love You (2009). Additionally, in 2007, he returned to the stage for a London revival of In Celebration. 'The Three Musketeers,' 'The Hobbit' Another cape-and-sword opportunity arose for Bloom when he was cast in a 2011 update of The Three Musketeers, which failed to catch hold at the U.S. box office. The actor then returned to working with Jackson, reprising his role as Greenleaf for portions of The Hobbit film trilogy, the first installment of which was released in December 2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Bloom reprised his role as Will Turner for a fifth time in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and showed his sense of humor in the Andy Samberg-led mockumentary Tour de Pharmacy, playing the character Juju Pepe. In 2018 he starred in the British-Chinese thriller action flick S.M.A.R.T. Chase.",0
"The Salvatore brothers finally had a reunion this week (Picture: CW)  Not that we’re counting or anything, but it’s been 399 days since the final episode of The Vampire Diaries aired on TV and every evening that we’re not re-watching the boxset is an evening wasted tbh.  Watership Down remake branded ‘insult to the original’ as Christmas slot baffles viewers  But if you already know seasons one through to eight off by heart then get ready to feel all the feels, because TVD stars Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley have teased a big reunion.  That’s right – the Salvatore brothers are back in town.  Vampire Diaries fans were not ready when this pic popped up on Instagram (Picture: Snapchat)  Ian, aka Damon, and Paul, aka Stefan, shared a Vampire Diaries reunion on Saturday, and marked the occasion for fans with a selfie that you probably need to print out and frame for your mantelpiece.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The picture, shared on Paul’s Instagram, was taken at The Vampire Diaries and The Originals Official Convention which took place in Nashville over the weekend, and it didn’t take long for all of the facial hair and strong jawline action to send the world into meltdown.  With the caption simply teasing the word ‘Reunion’, social media was quickly flooded by fans who didn’t know what to do with themselves after seeing the Salvatore brothers back side by side.  Another major bombshell for The Vampire Diaries world also landed this week, after showrunner Julie Plec revealed that the show has an unexpected connection with another of your favourite binge watches – Riverdale.  In the plot twist to end all plot twists, it turns out that the residence of Cheryl and Penelope Blossom, called Thistlehouse, was the original Salvatore Boarding House from the pilot episode of The Vampire Diaries.  ‘When we pulled up the driveway for the location scout to go see it, I was like, ‘This is so familiar. I feel like I’ve been here before. Gosh, I really think I know this (place)’.  ‘I actually took a good look at the house and realised it was the Salvatore House from (The Vampire Diaries) pilot. Isn’t that hilarious? Because we shot the pilot in Vancouver.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‘And the backyard of it, which is so gorgeous, is where we built our cemetery. That was a nice flashback!,’ Julie spilled.  This is all too much for any supernatural, drama loving, Ian Somerhalder-obsessed heart to handle.

"One wouldn’t want to be in Prince William’s (dancing) shoes right now. Dubbed “throne idle” in the British press after skipping a Commonwealth Day service earlier this week in order to go skiing with friends, the 34-year-old royal is also understood to be in the dog house with his wife.  Kate is said by Royal Watch sources to be understandably “less than pleased” that her husband has been filmed partying with his friends and an unidentified woman. The new footage, which emerged Wednesday in several tabloids, shows Prince William singing and dancing with friends during a boys-only skiing trip. Shot at the popular Farinet nightclub in Verbier, the video also shows the prince putting his hand on the waist of a mystery woman  William was also filmed “dad dancing” at the club and enjoying himself on the slopes just hours before senior royals including the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Harry attended Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service. The Queen considers the date one of the most important in the royal calendar and William’s decision not to attend was seen as significant and controversial. While the Duchess of Cambridge stayed at home with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, William, who is now back in the U.K, chose to have fun on the slopes instead of attending the service.  VIDEO: 12 Facts About Kate Middleton  “It was William’s choice to go away, but make no mistake Kate wears the trousers in their marriage, and she won’t be happy with William’s antics. She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she’ll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting,” says a source.  The couple will put on a united front when they travel to Paris for a state visit on Friday, but the ski trip has once again put the spotlight on William who has so far carried out just 13 days of royal engagements this year. The Queen, who has been in poor health, has clocked up 24 days of official duties.  Last February, the Cambridges posed on the slopes of Courchevel where they enjoyed their first family ski holiday with George and Charlotte. This year, in contrast, William opted to hit the slopes solo with a group of male friends who included Guy Pelly, James Meade, and Tom Van Straubenzee.  According to The Sun newspaper, Wills and his pals spent Sunday night dancing to the band Hussy and looked “very worse for wear” after downing “several drinks.” William, who is stepping down from his job as an air-ambulance pilot later this year, does have a history for having fun when he’s out with the boys. At Tom van Straubenzee’s wedding four years ago—which Kate had to miss because she was pregnant with Prince George—William reportedly ended up losing part of his front tooth after he was knocked in the face accidentally by his friend Tom Inskip during a marathon drinking session.  According to sources on the slopes, the champagne—and spirits—were flowing in Verbier last weekend. Wills and his friends were photographed enjoying a liquid lunch with 24-year-old Australian model Sophie Taylor who works at the Farinet nightclub and a 30-year-old British former beautician from Blackpool named Rosie Peate who they met during the vacation. The group drank British beer, wine, and Jagerbombs and seemed to be in high spirits, with the prince high-fiving Sophie Taylor at one point during the lunch. Later William and his friends met up with the girls at another posh bar where the drinking continued.  Kate, who’s not a big drinker, is apparently not the only wife said to be annoyed. Guy Pelly, whose other half, Lizzie Wilson, is about to give birth, is according to a source also “in deep trouble.”  Get Vanity Fair’s Royal Watch A weekly overview of the chatter from Kensington Palace and beyond.

"Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million ($9,423,695) after a trial that ended with a Los Angeles jury finding in the producer’s favor in a royalties dispute with Michael Jackson’s estate, Variety reports.  The lawsuit, which Jones filed in 2013, stemmed from Jones’ claim that he was owed royalties for a series of projects that were released after Jackson died, including the music used in two Cirque du Soleil productions and music featured in the This Is It concert film. Jones said he was owed $30 million.  Last week, Jones took the witness stand and claimed he was “cheated out of a lot of money” by the Jackson estate.  During the two-week trial, lawyers debated over interpreting the contract language that determined how Jones’ royalties should be computed, particularly the contracts from Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. Attorneys for Jones argued that those contracts entitled Jones to royalties from the posthumous This is It along with proceeds from the two Cirque du Soleil shows. Meanwhile, Howard Weitzman, who represented the Jackson estate, argued that Jackson made the major contributions to the sound of each song.  “While the jury denied Quincy Jones $21 million – or more than two-thirds of what he demanded — from The Estate of Michael Jackson, we still believe that giving him millions of dollars that he has no right to receive under his contracts is wrong,” Weitzman and Zia Modabber, attorneys for The Estate of Michael Jackson, said in a statement. “This would reinterpret the legal language in, and effectively rewrite, contracts that Mr. Jones lived under for more than three decades, admitted he never read, referred to as ‘contract, montract,’ and told the jurors he didn’t ‘give a damn’ about. Any amount above and beyond what is called for in his contracts is too much and unfair to Michael’s heirs. Although Mr. Jones is portraying this is a victory for artists’ rights, the real artist is Michael Jackson and it is his money Mr. Jones is seeking.”  Following the verdict, Jones said in a statement via Variety, “As an artist, maintaining the vision and integrity of one’s creation is of paramount importance. I, along with the team I assembled with Michael, took great care and purpose in creating these albums, and it has always given me a great sense of pride and comfort that three decades after they were originally recorded, these songs are still being played in every corner of the world.  “This lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,” he continued. ” Although this judgement is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter. I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists’ rights overall.”",1
"How could no one behind Hard Summer’s new preview trailer suspect that so many fans would hate it?  The clip, which can be watched here and does contain imagery that could offend, may have been done with the intent to admirably satirize the lack of women on music festival bills (including Hard's). But doing so by putting gigantic prosthetic breasts on top-billed male acts including DJ Snake, What So Not, Party Favor and Claude VonStroke?",1

"© Provided by Bang Priyanka Chopra spent Fourth of July with her boyfriend Nick Jonas and his family in New York City.  Priyanka Chopra celebrated Fourth of July with Nick Jonas' relatives in New York.  The 35-year-old actress is said to be dating the 'Jealous' hitmaker and it looks like she's had no problems settling into his tight-knit family as she arranged a bike ride with her beau, his brother Joe Jonas and his fiancée Sophie Turner on the Upper West Side of the city on Independence Day earlier this week.  A source told E! News: ''Joe and Sophie rode faster with a pack of friends, while Nick and Priyanka were in the back. They seemed very touchy feely.''  The brunette beauty then joined Nick's whole family - including his brother Kevin Jonas, sister-in-law Danielle Jonas, and nieces Alena and Valentina - in the evening on a private roof terrace to watch the fireworks.  This isn't the first time the 'Quantico' actress has been involved in Nick's family celebrations as she was also invited to his cousin's wedding in New Jersey last month.  An insider explained: ''It's a huge deal that Nick brought Priyanka to his cousin's wedding. He's dated a lot over the last couple years but it's never been anything serious, so this is a big step. Nick and Priyanka really like each other, and his family enjoyed getting to know her as well. She fit right in!''  Although things seem to be heating up between her and the 25-year-old singer, Priyanka still doesn't seem keen on getting married in the future.  She said recently: ''Because I'm in my 30s, which is obviously over the hill, my mother said to me: 'You'll get married the day you find someone who appreciates how hard you worked to get where you are.' Think about it. All the fairytales we've always read, end when the princess gets married. Why is there no story beyond that? That's the end of her life! After she gets married, what happens?''",1
"Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up after more than two years together, Us Weekly reports. And Lambert may have recently hinted at the split on stage to her fans.  Before performing “Tin Man” during a concert in Knoxville in March, Lambert talked about how she channels heartbreak into her music, according to Knox News. ""I make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel. I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favorite,” she said. “And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one. It's called 'Tin Man.'""  East also opened up about the struggles of dating as a touring musician. ""There's a true admiration there and a large level of understanding on both sides, for sure,"" he told InStyle in January. ""It's always difficult to be a traveling musician and still keep things together. Understanding is definitely a huge factor.""  The two started dating in 2015 after Lambert’s divorce from Blake Shelton earlier that year. They met after she went to one of East’s shows and got introduced to him through a friend. Throughout their relationship, they wrote songs together and supported each other on red carpets.  But fans noticed that lately, the two had not talked about their relationship or posted about each other on social media; East hadn’t posted a photo of Lambert since her birthday in November, and Lambert hadn’t posted an image of East since January. Representatives for Lambert and East did not respond to People’s request for comment on the split.  There might still be hope for the two, though. “They have spent a lot of time apart, but potentially could end up back together,” a source told Us Weekly. “The love is still there.”",1
"Queer Eye Sky’s the Limit Season 2 Episode 5 Editor’s Rating 5 stars * * * * * « Previous Next »  I know that Queer Eye is always going to make me cry, but when this episode started, I didn’t think that I was going to be this shocked. I wasn’t sure what I was watching, but I knew it was riveting. I knew that it had the potential to change the entire series as we’ve known it so far. Yes, at the beginning of the episode, Karamo was not wearing a satin bomber jacket. It was actually a knit. Like a sweater. Sure, it still zipped up the front so it wasn’t so far from his usual uniform, but still. I didn’t quite know what to do with myself.  While that shocked me, the real shock was watching this episode’s makeover subject, Skyler, getting his top surgery. We see Skyler wake up and look down at his chest, which used to have breasts, and see it flat and masculine as he always wanted it to be and his face erupts with emotion. It was really and truly moving way to begin the episode.  The other shocking thing is that redheads are bad with anesthesia. Who knew this was a real thing? I certainly didn’t. It’s such a shame that Skyler not only had to spend $8,000 of his own money to have the surgery, but will now face thousands of dollars of medical bills because of the complications just from being a redhead.  As hard as being a ginge is, being trans is even harder. Many people know the struggle of being transgender in our society, but what really struck me about this episode was how even the silly everyday things that so many of us take for granted can be triggering for a trans person. I never would have thought that getting a suit tailored would lead to an emotional breakdown for Skyler because he felt uncomfortable with someone all up in his pants business. Or the fact that some bitch at the DMV could cause such emotional pain. I mean, we’ve all felt existential dread at the DMV, but this is a whole different level for Skyler.  I must say that trans people really are heroes. The strength it takes for them to be themselves every day is so hard, but they continue to soldier on when there is still so little support for them. It’s absolutely astonishing and brave. That said, it doesn’t mean that some of them don’t have truly awful style. Sorry, Skyler.  Skyler dresses in poorly fitting basketball jerseys, silly novelty hats, and the worst shoes I have ever seen on someone who isn’t named Mario Batali. He’s just so happy to be a boy that he’s dressing like a 19-year-old at a third-tier state school. His house is decorated like one too, with the raised bed and all of his crap underneath it. He tells us that he had to leave his parents’ house at 17 after he came out to them, and it’s like he’s living in this arrested ideal adolescence that he never got to enjoy.  Maybe I should cut him a bit more slack, but this guy has a couch that is literally called the “cat pee couch.” The only thing worse is all of the rainbow-flag Pride paraphernalia around the house. Ugh, I am a proud homosexual, but I hate that stupid rainbow flag. There is no way that you can make it look not tacky. No matter what you do with it, it still looks like a tourist in Key West wearing a fanny pack while on a break from a Princess Cruise. The rainbow flag and the fact that Christina Aguilera isn’t a bigger star are the twin scourges of the queer community.  Because this is a very different episode, we didn’t even get that much of a makeover. Instead, we mostly heard about Skyler’s story. And that was fine with me because, girl, did I sob. I sobbed when he got a license that says he is male, I sobbed when he tried on the first suit that really fit him well, and I sobbed when he got up onstage at his “coming-out party” and started stripping for the crowd and showing off the body he was so proud of.  I loved that Tan wanted Skyler to look good in a suit because, he’s right, every man’s body looks more masculine with some good tailoring. It was really sweet that he brought in his friend whose suiting company works a lot with the trans community and has a few easy tricks to make their suits fit their bodies more comfortably. However, I am pissed at Tan. How the hell does he not know who Todrick Hall is? Has he not watched Drag Race? The only thing I hate more than the rainbow flag is people who say, “We’re going to take your gay card away,” but I feel like Tan shouldn’t be allowed to film any more of these episodes at least until he’s watched All Stars 2.  Also, as soon as Skyler kept going on about his love of the YouTube star and Drag Race fixture, I thought, “If we leave this episode without a guest appearance from Mx. Hall, then these queens did not do their job.” Thankfully, they did not disappoint and Todrick showed up on Skyler’s doorstep for a teary tête-à-tête. It would have been very easy for Skyler to just fan out about Toddy’s videos and singles, but instead I was really touched by what he said about how Todrick really showed him how he can blend the feminine and masculine energies together to make something that is totally unique and wonderful. There are plenty out there who scoff at YouTube celebrities, but that is the power of the medium is harnessed correctly. (Speaking of harnessed correctly, I wouldn’t mind seeing Todrick Hall in a harness, if he’s taking requests for his next video.)  Meanwhile, Bobby got rid of the cat pee couch and made Skyler’s room look like a rec room at St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, but even that was a vast improvement. Antoni showed Skyler how to make poke and I will not make fun of Antoni in this recap because it was all so moving and lovely. Yes, I made this oath during an episode where he wears guyliner, so basically I’m deducting this recap on my taxes as a charitable donation.  Jonathan had the hardest job of all: He had to convince Skyler to trim his signature beard, which is what he thinks makes his face look the most masculine. But Jonathan was right, his bright-red beard was a bit too manicured, so it actually made his face look more feminine rather than the opposite. When Jonathan gave Skyler a haircut and a beard trim, he not only looked butcher but he also looked younger, which is a good look on anyone. Let’s face it: Being trans is hard enough, so the least that the Fab Five can do is give a trans man a good beard and rid his house of all of that ugly rainbow.",1

"[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the Big Brother season finale.]  Big Brother season 19 brought a slew of blindsides, backstabbing and betrayal, and now it's time to see who won it all.  All season Paul Abrahamian was the frontrunner as he ruled the game and played puppet master to a house full of followers. So, did the season 18 runner-up pull out a win his second time around?  The answer is: no.  The finale saw Paul sit in the final three with Christmas Abbott and Josh Martinez. And Josh came out victorious in one of the most ""volatile"" seasons of the show, as host Julie Chen described it.  It was a shock to some that the Miami native walked away this season with a lot more than just meatballs, but one thing that wasn't a shock was how angry the jury felt towards Paul.  In the jury segment that was full of bitter members it was one of the most entertaining moments of the summer with a face-off between fan-favorite Mark and the one deemed as a piece of furniture by fans, Matt.  ""Very poor jury management,"" Mark said about Paul. ""I'm a bitter juror,"" admitted Elena. ""I don't respect how this season played out and I don't respect his strategies,"" said Mark. And when Alex went to cast her vote for who she wanted to win she made it clear that she was voting for who stabbed her in the front rather than the back.  Ultimately the final vote came down to both Paul and Josh's rival Cody, who ultimately voted for Josh to win the game.  As for the winner of ""America's Favorite Houseguest""? Cody just walked away $25,000 richer.  What did you think of the season 19 finale? Sound off in the comments section below.",1

"The Biebs comes from a very poor, trashy family in Ontario--a teenage mother, a deadbeat father who only re-emerged when his kid became famous (and then they started getting tattoos, getting wasted, and getting laid together like father and sons do), and no hope in hell of a future. He was a cherubic kid with a lot of musical talent, and then the story goes that Usher ""discovered"" him on YouTube and the rest is history. We all know that when you make it as massive as Biebs did, with no solid family to ground him, a lot of dark shit unfolds. And the money beckons. Biebs is a bona-fide prolapsed asshole to be sure, but he is an uneducated high school dropout who came from a family that went for the money, and he became world-famous when he was a naive kid. He was the sacrifice. With a very cute face and hairless young body and a stage mother who pushed her little boy into show biz.  During that journey to wealth and riches, you don't think he was a pass-around Patty to powerful men, like the execrable pervert Kevin Spacey, whose face has always been characterized by smugness and perversion?  ..isn't Patty his fucking MOM'S name?!

"Shocking new allegations have emerged about the sexual misconduct scandal that is quickly enveloping Matt Lauer. On Wednesday, mere hours after NBC announced that it had fired the Today anchor because of a complaint about alleged sexual misconduct, Variety has dropped a report with hideous allegations about the TV star’s alleged behavior. The claims run the gamut: he made lewd sexual remarks about female colleagues; he once invited a female employee to his secluded office, then showed her his penis; he gave one female colleague a sex toy with “an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her,” Variety writes.  The allegations don’t stop there. Lauer would also reportedly quiz female producers about their sex lives, and play a crass, office-themed version of the game “fuck, marry, or kill.” He also reportedly had a button on his desk that allowed him to lock the door; two women tell Variety that it enabled him to “welcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him.” One former producer “who knew firsthand of these encounters” also told Variety that Lauer, who is married, allegedly cheated on his wife.  “There were a lot of consensual relationships, but that’s still a problem because of the power he held,” this person said. “He couldn’t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he’s Matt Lauer and he’s married. So he’d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn’t ever complain.”  Representatives for Lauer have not yet responded to Vanity Fair’s request for comment. Variety notes that he could not be reached for comment. The piece is the result of a two-month investigation which stretches back before The New York Times dropped its stunning Harvey Weinstein piece, which kicked off the sexual misconduct reckoning in Hollywood and beyond. Like Weinstein prior to the controversy, Lauer is a powerful figure in the entertainment industry. He’s been the face of the Today show for years, raking in an incredibly lucrative $25-million annual salary, per Variety. That’s why it was a shock for industry insiders to learn that NBC fired him so quickly, before any bombshell investigative report broke the alleged scandal.  Shortly after Variety published its report, the Times published one as well, reporting that NBC had received two additional complaints about Lauer. One was from a former employee who says she had sex with Lauer in his office in 2001. She told the Times, she “felt helpless because she didn’t want to lose her job,” adding that she “didn’t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed.”  NBC’s human resources department contacted her on Wednesday regarding the allegations, she said. Representatives for Lauer did not respond to V.F.’s request for comment about this allegation. Reps for Lauer also did not respond to the Times’ request for comment.  The announcement about Lauer’s firing was made Wednesday morning by Today anchor Savannah Guthrie, who read a note on air from NBC News Chairman Andy Lack:  “Dear colleagues, on Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company’s standards. As a result, we’ve decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he’s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident. Our highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender. We are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization—and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.”  “I will tell you right now, we do not know more than I have just shared with you,” Guthrie said after delivering the statement, later adding that she was “heartbroken” for Lauer, as well as the women who came forward. “We are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks: how do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? And I don’t know the answer to that.”  Megyn Kelly also addressed the news on the Today show, saying she has known Lauer for years and he has “been a friend, and kind, and supportive.” However, she also folded in a larger point about misconduct in the workplace. “What we don’t see is the pain on the faces of those who found the courage to come forward. And it is a terrifying thing to do. We don’t see the career opportunities women lose because of sexual harassment—or the intense stress it causes a woman dealing with it when she comes to work each day. I am thinking of those women this morning, and hoping they are O.K. The days to come will not be easy.”  The firing has sparked a nationwide discussion, with claims flying about Lauer and his alleged behavior and purported infidelity. It has also inspired renewed interest in his past comments, particularly this 2012 joke segment about sexual harassment, and the controversial departure of Ann Curry, the former Today show anchor who tearfully left the show in 2012. In an interview with People, Curry said she is “still really processing” the news about the allegations, but hopes to see a change in workplace culture. “We need to move this revolution forward and make our workplaces safe. Corporate America is quite clearly failing to do so, and unless it does something to change that, we need to keep doing more ourselves,” she said.",1
"It may no longer be a green light to consider Lorde a member of Taylor Swift’s squad.  The 20-year-old New Zealand pop star revealed to Australian Yahoo affiliate Sunrise that, for her, the allure of a celebrity friend circle doesn’t fit her social life.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I don’t hang out with these people at all,” she said, referring to the influx of famous friends she came in contact with after the success of her debut album Pure Heroine at age 16.  When the interviewer suggested that she was a member of Swift’s so-called “squad,” Lorde jokingly rolled her eyes. “You know, you make friends in different places, but I think for the most part I’m not, like, calling my idols for advice necessarily.”  Lorde, who reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with her latest album Melodrama, said the best way for her to mentally process meeting her musical heroes like Beyoncé and Swift is to pretend it’s another world.  “The second you think too hard about it, you’ll just go insane, so it’s best to be like, ‘We’re in wonderland and it’s just what happens around here,'” she said.  She and the 1989 songstress seem to have a close bond. In March, Swift broke her social media silence to promote Lorde’s new single, and in November, threw her a star-studded 20th birthday bash at Carbone in New York City.

Lorde received backlash last month when she compared her friendship with Swift to a disease during an interview with the Guardian, trying to express the challenges of staying close with someone so famous.  “It’s like having a friend with very specific allergies. There are certain places you can’t go together; certain things you can’t do,” she said. “There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship — it’s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.”  Lorde eventually apologized for the comment on Twitter, writing that she “f—– up & it was really insensitive.”  didn't mention taylor, but regardless, i fucked up & that was really insensitive. i'm sorry 🌹 — Lorde (@lorde) June 20, 2017  Attention to Swift’s so-called “squad” mostly began in 2015 after the release of her star-studded “Bad Blood” music video, which featured Selena Gomez, Zendaya, Lena Dunham and Gigi Hadid, among others.",1

That, if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup. … I hope I gave her a little bit of closure.”  Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Becca Kufrin ABC  Kufrin will, in fact, be the next Bachelorette — a decision that was announced on Tuesday during the live After the Final Rose conclusion to Arie Luyendyk Jr.‘s season.  “I’m very happy for her,” Luyendyk Jr., who is now engaged to Burnham, said of the decision on Wednesday. “I’m happy that she’s going to be able to find her true love through the show.”  “This ending obviously wasn’t perfect.

It’s not fun. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It was like a slap in the face.”  That being said, Kufrin just wants to put that chapter of her life behind her.  “I went through all the emotions. I was mad for awhile, I was so sad and down for awhile, I was p—– for awhile,” she said. “At this point, I want this chapter of Arie to be done and close it and put it on the shelf and put it away.”  “I’m still going to feel a sense of compassion for him because I did love him,” she continued. “But at this point, I want him to be happy, I want to be done and not have to worry about them anymore.

"The One with the Rumor is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American television situation comedy Friends, which aired on NBC on November 22, 2001.[1] It continues the series' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition, and guest-stars cast member Jennifer Aniston's then-husband Brad Pitt in the uncredited role of Will Colbert, who reveals that he and Ross (David Schwimmer) were part of an ""I hate Rachel"" club. The two of them hated Rachel Green (Aniston) and got the exchange student from Thailand to join their club. Will revealed that they spread a rumor in high school that Rachel (Aniston) was a hermaphrodite.  The episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[1] It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as ""insulting"" by a national intersex education group. Pitt admitted his appearance was mainly to promote his upcoming film, Spy Game.  Plot [ edit ]  Monica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). She also tells a crestfallen Joey Tribbiani that she won't be cooking a turkey because of Will's, Chandler's, Rachel's and Phoebe's aversion to the poultry. Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe's maternity clothing to ease the strain on his stomach.  Will arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight. However, he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel Green, who he hated in high school, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognise him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he - and Ross - founded the ""I Hate Rachel"" club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel's rumour put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will's rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel's queen bee status, and that they're having a baby together. Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation, but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but isn't going to marry her.  The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.  Production [ edit ]  It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood,[2] though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen.[3] Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.[4] When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway.[3] The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.[5]  Reception [ edit ]  As the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: ""Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the audience did, too.""[6] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was ""definitely [...] going against type""[7] and LeBlanc called him ""really great on the show"".[4] USA Today rates Will's line ""Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates"" one of the best of the episode.[8]  The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode ""ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional"". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society's website and read an on-air apology before future episodes.[9]  Primetime Emmy Award nominations [ edit ]  Pitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.[10]  References [ edit ]",0
"Toronto’s very own Drake says he was a victim of a “fake media story” after rumours surfaced online that he told a fan to take off her hijab at one of his concerts. The rapper posted on Instagram that he was talking to four women, one of whom was wearing a winter scarf, and he told her to take it off.  Drake will likely focus his attention to the Grammy Awards this weekend. The Canadian is up for eight awards, including album of the year.

"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'",0
"For the most part, we've heard a lot about how protective Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan was over his costar Dakota Johnson on set, how much BDSM research was done to get those scenes just right, and so on. But far more scandalous set secrets are coming to light about the film, and, frankly, we're a little worried.  According to reports from Star, which we admittedly take with a grain of salt, life wasn't so honky dory on the highly publicized Fifty Shades movie set.  More from The Stir: Quiz: What's Your '50 Shades of Grey' Movie-Viewing Style?  For starters, the tabloid alleges Jamie was perpetually ill-prepared for scenes, never having memorized his lines. This resulted in cast and crew working overtime into the wee hours of the morning.  Then there's the matter of Dakota, who reportedly acted very un-Anastasia-like by causing friction between crew members and throwing diva tantrums over wardrobe (in one instance going so far as to throw a pair of shoes at a stylist).  So was anyone professional on set? That award is said to go to Eloise Mumford, who plays Anastasia's roommate Kate. She was responsible for cracking jokes with crew members and keeping things light on set.  We were already privy to the fact that director Sam Taylor-Johnson and author EL James didn't get along on set, like at all, but at least their creative differences have the potential to make the Fifty Shades sex scenes smokin' hot.  More from The Stir: 50 Shades Extended Sneak Peek Will Send Shivers Down Your Spine  With what sounds like a lot of crankiness and drama on set, can this cast even be trusted with a sequel? A forgetful leading man and thankless leading lady are not exactly a recipe for success. And if this is the way they acted before the first film has even been released, how much worse can their antics be on the set of a second film when the franchise has been proven a big-screen success?  The right amount of money tends to solve problems in Hollywood, but it certainly can't help make parts two and three the happiest movie sets in the history of the business.  Are you surprised by these behind-the-scenes revelations?      Image via Universal Pictures and Focus Features",0

"EXCLUSIVE: In a very competitive situation, Netflix has landed The Politician, a new hourlong comedy series from longtime collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow’s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt’s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney. A mega deal at merged Disney-Fox or a streaming giant like Netflix, a production venture, possibly with Walden, are just a few of many possibilities as the uber producer plots the next chapter in his career.

"International Women’s Day may have passed, but that’s not stopping Iggy Azalea from keeping its memory alive. The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she’s risking ‘serious heartbreak’ trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.  “Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”  “Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up. In fact, we’re told Khloe’s hired some private eyes to keep tabs on her dude. “She loves Tristan wholeheartedly and he’s been nothing but a stand-up, loving man,” another source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “But she can’t help but worry sometimes. Khloe spends as much time in Cleveland as possible and has spies in every city his team plays in.”  HollywoodLifers, do you think Khloe will listen to Iggy?",0

"Rachel looked radiant on the red carpet Picture: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)  Rachel Weisz added some major sass to her classic English rose look at last night’s premiere of The Mercy.  The 47-year-old, who plays Clare Crowhurst in the drama alongside Colin Firth, wore a high-necked blue floral dress with button detailing that would have been rather demure, were it not for the thigh-high slit in the skirt.  Work it, Rach.  Teaming the striking dress with black sandals and simple make-up, Rachel was effortlessly chic at the premiere at the Curzon Mayfair in London.  The floral dress featured a daring side-split Picture: Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage)  Rachel posed on the red carpet with her co-star Colin, who looked dapper as always in a suit and tie, overcoat and thick-rimmed glasses.  The Mercy documents Donald Crowhurst’s attempt to complete the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race in 1968, with Colin playing Crowhurst.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Rachel’s red carpet appearance comes after she was uncharacteristically open about her marriage to Bond actor Daniel Craig.  Rachel and Colin star alongside each other in The Mercy Picture: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)  The couple, who have been friends since their 20s, got married in 2011 in a private ceremony attended by just four people, including Daniel’s daughter from a previous marriage and Rachel’s son from her relationship with Darren Aronofsky.  Speaking to the ES Magazine last month, Rachel said of marriage: ‘It’s very personal, it’s very private. I don’t think mine’s particularly exceptional apart from that we’re both in the public eye.  ‘But I never thought I would get married. It was not an ambition of mine. It was the opposite.’  The Brit added: ‘I couldn’t relate to romantic comedies — marriage seems to be the whole point of them. Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment.’  The Mercy hits cinemas on 9 February.  Got a story?

"If you're a big fan of Khloé Kardashian, then the last few days have not exactly been the greatest. On April 10, it was reported that Tristan Thompson cheated on her, at a time when Kardashian was set to give birth any day. And, although Kardashian remained radio silent when the world initially got hold of Thompson's rumored affairs, we're reportedly hearing about her reaction to the whole ordeal. On April 11, E! News reported Khloe Kardashian's response to Tristan Thompson cheating reports, and it is beyond sad.  On April 10, it came out that Thompson, who was in New York City with his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates for the weekend, was spotted on Saturday, April 7, at a rooftop bar and lounge. According to The Daily Mail, Thompson was seen kissing another woman who wasn't Kardashian. A woman who reportedly filmed Thompson with the mystery woman told The Daily Mail, ""I was there and he was on the table right next to us with a group of friends and some girl who he was obviously making out with all night ... They were holding each other and it was so obvious. They were there when I got there and they were part of a big group of friends."" Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian and Thompson's teams regarding the report but did not hear back by the time of publication.  Fans of the couple were not happy — and for good reason. When all of this came to a head, Kardashian was in Cleveland, getting ready to give birth to their daughter. You know Cleveland? The place that Kardashian moved to from Los Angeles to be with Thompson and prepare for her labor? She even wrote about the relocation on her app, telling her fans why she decided to make the big move. She wrote,  Throughout my pregnancy, I traveled back and forth between L.A. and Cleveland quite a bit, but after a while, it was a little difficult. It was more tiring and my body got swollen, which never used to happen before pregnancy. I obviously love both cities, but I will say I’m happy to be in Cleveland right now.  She continued,  ...I’m with Tristan and I get my home time — cooking, being with my love, and just more of a routine. In L.A., I’m SWAMPED with work. But then again, I love being in L.A. because I get to see my sisters and my mom, and I have my trainer and the people that I’ve grown up with. So there are perks to both cities for me!  But now, Kardashian has finally weighed in on the matter and responded to the report of Thompson's alleged affairs.  E! News reports from a source that Kardashian is ""distraught"" over the reports. The source continued,  Her entire world has been turned upside down. She cried hysterically all night. She begged to come back to L.A. and tried to find any way to make it work but her doctor wouldn't let her. She just wants to be with her family and leave as soon as possible. Kris is there and completely supporting her.  The source also said,  She will obviously never be able to trust Tristan again or look at him the same way ... Her world is shattered. She is in complete disbelief that this is happening. The family absolutely believes it's in Khloe's best interest to end the relationship but will support her either way.  Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian's team for comment on the report but did not hear back by the time of publication.  Honestly, this is heartbreaking. It can't be easy to have all of this negative attention surrounding you, especially while pregnant. The source also said, ""Everyone is in crisis mode and is trying to be very calm for Khloe ... They are really worried for her. They are worried about the health of the baby and thinks she will go into labor any second.""  It breaks my heart that Kardashian seemed so over-the-moon with Thompson, only to have something like this surface about the man she loves.  Beyond sad.  To add salt in the wound, TMZ claims to have obtained surveillance footage of Thompson reportedly hanging out with three women at a hookah lounge back in October of 2017, which appears to show Thompson kissing one woman, and provocatively touching another's chest — all of this allegedly happening while Kardashian was three months pregnant with Thompson's child.  Sending good thoughts over to Kardashian right now. No matter what happens moving forward, I hope she chooses to do what's best for her and her daughter. Luckily, she has a tight-knit family who will undoubtedly be there for her, regardless of her choice.",1

"In light of the Time’s Up movement, Bella Thorne is opening up about her past. The Disney alum revealed on Sunday, January 7, that she was sexually abused as a child.  “I was sexually abused and physically growing up from the day I can remember till I was 14..when I finally had the courage to lock my door at night and sit by it. All damn night. Waiting for someone to take advantage of my life again. Over and over I waited for it to stop and finally it did. But some of us aren’t as lucky to get out alive. Please today stand up for every soul Mistreated. #timesup,” Thorne wrote on Sunday via Instagram, referencing to the Time’s Up movement, which was created by women in Hollywood to fund legal aid for victims of sexual harassment.  Thorne rose to fame on Disney’s Shake It Up with Zendaya from 2010 to 2013. She made the transition from Disney to more adult roles as Paige on Freeform’s Famous in Love and the 2015 teen movie The Duff. The 20-year-old actress shared the same photo of herself on Twitter with a different caption about her childhood abuse.  “I never knew what was right or wrong growing up..I didn’t know the person sneaking into my bed room at night was a bad person. #timesup,” Thorne tweeted on Sunday.  As previously reported, the Babysitter star briefly addressed her childhood abuse in December via Twitter.  In response to a photo of Thorne dressed in a purple suit with no top, a Twitter user wrote at the time, “What did Disney do to this girl?! I think she was molested?”  “Yeah I was. So it wasn’t Disney,” Thorne fired back, adding in another tweet, “The world can be a sick place sometimes :/.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1
"Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt 2018: No Rom-Com Reunion, No Engagement for Justin Theroux's and Angelina Jolie's Former Spouses  Wednesday, August 1, 2018 1:22 AM UTC  Hollywood is practically built on rumors and hearsays, so it’s no surprise that there have been reports of all kinds about the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt situation. Numerous publications have been circulating details about how the pair will supposedly reunite on-screen with a romantic comedy project, for example. There have also been reports of the two getting married. As it turns out, neither of these is true.  Listing a variety of rumors and reports that it considers false, Gossip Cop has certainly gone out of its way to try and prove other publications wrong. The stated fictional declarations on that list include the supposed secret Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt marriage and that the pair is engaged once again.  Apparently, publications have been taking the smallest details to spin a narrative that was nowhere close to the truth. For example, a snapshot of the “Friends” actress wearing a ring for the movie she was shooting called “Murder Mystery” was mistaken for an engagement ring. This was quickly picked up and circulated all over the web, leading to a Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumor feeding frenzy.  There were also some reports about the former married couple tying the knot once more to celebrate what would have been their 18th wedding anniversary. As Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumors go, this one might just be one of the most misleading.  The part about the two actors being in a romantic-comedy has also been debunked recently by Gossip Cop, as well, which was reposted by MSN. Neither of the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt parties had shown any indication that such a rumor was even close to being true. In fact, past discussions alluding to the same topic have been denied by spokespersons of the actors before.  For Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt news that does come with evidence, it would seem that the “Fight Club” actor likes to model his look after whoever he is currently dating. This tidbit was posted by Twitter user Sarah McGonagall after she spotted it on an old Daily Express article. At least this proposition actually has photographic proof.",0
"Chrissy Teigen enlisted the help of Twitter to make banana bread  Of course she did.  Chrissy Teigen is everybody's favourite model, actress, and social media influencer.  She's also pretty good at baking having released her own cookbook, Cravings, last year - every single recipe in which looks absolutely delicious.  Last night, Chrissy wanted to make some banana bread.  Unfortunately, Chrissy did not have any bananas... or at least, she didn't have the exact kind of bananas that she required for her bread.  For her creation, she needed six browning bananas.  And no, she didn't want any banana browning hacks, she wanted the real thing.  So naturally, she took to Twitter.  ok this banana thing is getting ridiculous. don't tell me your banana browning hacks. just...if u have 6 BROWN bananas in the LA area lmk — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  Chrissy got a lot of replies for her request, but not all of them were serious.  So she took it upon herself to weed out the liars and asked that anyone who had six browning bananas in LA should take a picture with the fruit while doing the peace sign.  The model also said that, in return, she'd provide a signed cookbook, a pair of husband John Legend's underwear, and a BECCA makeup palette.  SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY. please send me a photo of u holding the bananas, giving the peace sign — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  if u have 6 BROWN bananas in the LA area, I will send my assistant to your home with a signed cookbook, John's underwear and a Becca palette — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  She was not playing.  Amazingly, a woman called Meg happened to have five browning bananas in her gaf.  She tweeted Chrissy to tell her she could have them if she wanted.  only 5 but they're yours if you want them pic.twitter.com/OV3mCOs134 — meg (@bymeg) September 21, 2017  Chrissy did.  And as promised, she sent her mom to go and pick up the bananas convinced that five would do the job.  Chrissy then tweeted saying that banana submissions were closed and she had gotten what she needed.  She also tweeted a picture of her mom with the bananas.  already home. that was...so fast. I will now do all grocery shopping like this pic.twitter.com/DLAzKvDezI — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  There was also a dog dressed a bellhop in the background, because why not?  yes my dog is a bellhop and no I have no reasoning — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  A couple of hours passed without incident until the mum-of-one realised that she needed just one more banana for her famous banana bread.  I really, really hate to say this but. I need one more banana pic.twitter.com/DBqKjQpSM7 — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  She tweeted a guy called Jake who she had been in touch with earlier that day. Jake had two bananas he was willing to sacrifice to the cause.  my mom just goes ""if I go he better have 2 bananas I not going in traffic for 1"" she's like a real dealer — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017  Jake looked only delighted to be receiving a pair of John Legend's underwear, too.  one of the cutest things I've ever seen @onairjake pic.twitter.com/5YxPXsnPNK — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 22, 2017  this is no longer my banana bread. this is *our* banana bread. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 22, 2017  Thankfully, Chrissy then had enough bananas to continue with her banana bread.  She expressed her gratitude for the help Twitter had given her.  She then posted a couple of videos of the finished banana bread.  And, to be fair to her, it does look pretty unreal.  Fair play, Chrissy.",1
"Figure skating has been part of the Olympic Games since 1908 and has been included in 25 Olympic Games.

"Ben Margot/Associated Press  Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night.  The league announced on Friday, via Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Thompson has been fined $25,000, while his flagrant-2 foul has been downgraded to a flagrant-1.  Thompson was ejected with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime of Golden State's 124-114 victory after the referee deemed he threw an elbow at Warriors guard Shaun Livingston. He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.  Instead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.  When asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):  That confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:  Thompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9"", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.  Although he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.  The on-court altercation could have led to the suspension of multiple Cavaliers. Like Thompson, Kevin Love also avoided a ban for his Game 1 actions.

When she's gone, she'll FaceTime the baby whenever, and apparently True isn't always into it.  ""I do get annoyed because she doesn't give me any play time on FaceTime, she like doesn't really care about me,"" she told a panel at the event.

""You get so much unsolicited advice that it drives you crazy, and you get really stressed out, but you're pregnant, you're nine months, and you're like, 'What is this? You're freaking me out. I'm already in this. I don't know what to do. There's no turning back.' And people just say the craziest things to you.""  She said Kim is her go-to for advice, because she's not judgmental.

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was convicted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them.  The jury found Cosby, 80, guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his other accusers in the courtroom.  The verdict was one of the first major courtroom victories for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond.  Upon the reading of the first guilty verdict, several of Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with joy. Cosby's head was bent slightly, eyes shut.  Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004.  Constand maintained her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.  Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane.  ""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed.  Cosby faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count. He remains free on bail until sentencing. But he is unlikely to spend much time in jail.  O'Neill said that because of Cosby's age and his medical condition — his eyesight is poor — ""I am not going to simply lock him up."" Cosby has to surrender his passport and must remain in his nearby home, the judge said.  Lili Bernard, an accuser who once appeared as a guest on ""The Cosby Show,"" the groundbreaking 1980s sitcom that introduced an upper-middle-class black family to American viewers, let out a wail as the verdict was read. She began to cry, and court personnel escorted her from the courtroom.  ""I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,"" she told reporters through tears outside the courthouse.  Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they would ""very strongly"" appeal the verdict. Cosby's first trial ended in a mistrial in June.  ""We are very disappointed by the verdict,"" Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, said outside the courthouse. ""We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything, and the fight is not over.""  Steele lauded Constand and the other accusers for their bravery in standing up to Cosby over the years.  ""The most important person in this is Andrea Constand — 14 years later, it may be easy to forget that she was the first courageous person that stood up in public,"" Steele said during a news conference. Constand stood next to the prosecutors, her hands folded in front of her, but she didn't speak.  ""Her quiet courage and her actions through this have helped victims stand up,"" Steele said. ""I hope and I pray that our actions have shown that we will stand up with those victims.""  Janice Baker-Kinney, who testified that Cosby gave her Quaaludes and sexually assaulted her, told MSNBC after the verdict that ""the relief is overwhelming.""  ""I'm shaking with relief, and I can't stop sobbing,"" she said.  Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several of Cosby's accusers, praised the verdict while the women stood behind her, shoulder to shoulder, their arms around one another.  ""I truly hope that his long list of victims will now be able to find some kind of peace,"" she told reporters.  The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. Earlier, the judge read back part of the testimony of the defense's star witness, who said Constand once said she could frame a ""high-profile person.""  The jury was also read back Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian admitted giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her.  Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.  The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were rescinding honorary degrees they had bestowed on Cosby, while Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said the conviction ""provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect"" to an honorary doctorate it gave him in 1991.  Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden portrayed Cosby as a sexual predator who used his TV image as a man of wholesome values to target women he believed he could silence. Prosecutors called five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand.  ""He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,"" Feden said.  Last month, O'Neill ruled that the additional accusers could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern or that Cosby knew what would happen when he drugged Constand.  Attorneys for Cosby asked pointed questions about the accusers' histories of drug abuse, criminal backgrounds, personal relationships and sex lives.  Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel.  Mesereau asked Dickinson whether she had spread false rumors about being pregnant with Sylvester Stallone's child. She said the remark was an honest mistake.  Bill Cosby arrives at court for deliberations on Thursday. Brendan McDermid / Reuters  ""I had sex with two men that month. He wasn't the only contender,"" she said, garnering smiles from the jury.  Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss described Dickinson in closing arguments as a ""failed starlet"" and ""an aged-out model.""  ""It sounds like she has slept with every single guy on the planet,"" Bliss said. ""Is Ms. Dickinson really the moral beacon that women's movements want?""  The defense also suggested that Constand and the other accusers were making false accusations in the hope of gaining fame or fortune.  They repeatedly pointed to the $3.4 million payout that Constand received from Cosby in 2006. And they highlighted Allred's proposal in 2014 to set aside a $100 million fund for victims of Cosby if he was unwilling to waive the statute of limitations to allow his accusers to confront him in court.  Some of the questions and arguments drew scorn from observers in the courtroom.  Bernard, who sat in the courtroom for much of the trial, called the defense's closing argument highly offensive.  ""It was based solely on rape myths, on victim blaming, on victim shaming and on a character assassination of really credible witnesses, of very righteous victims, of victims that were clearly telling the truth,"" Bernard told reporters as the jury deliberated Wednesday.  ""It was just a display of utter misogyny and buffoonery, and you know, I'm just, like, 'Wow, how low can they go?' "" she said.  The #MeToo movement was a cloud over the defense's closing arguments Tuesday, with Bliss telling jurors that they shouldn't allow it to influence their decision.  ""Don't get me wrong — bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.  ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added.  Meredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown. Daniella Silva reported from New York.",1
"The first beef of 2017. Chris Brown and Soulja Boy got into a feud on social media on Monday, January 2, over Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran.  The fight ignited after the ""Crank That"" rapper, 26, liked a photo of Tran, 28, on Instagram. ""Chris brown just called me and said he wanna fight me because I liked @karrueche picture on Instagram this n—a a bitch,"" Soulja Boy wrote on Twitter on Monday night.  ""Aye @chrisbrown pull up n—a I'll knock yo Bitch Ass out,"" he continued. ""F–k @chrisbrown. That n—a @chrisbrown better not tweet s–t with his p–sy ass. He called my phone trippin so now I'm trippin F–k n—a. Fruits!""  Soulja Boy then brought up Brown's tumultuous relationship with ex Rihanna as well as his previous legal trouble. ""Chris Brown think he hard cuz he hit a woman,"" the rapper tweeted. ""And jumped a fan at his house party on New Years lmao u can't fight Bitch do that s–t to me.""  Brown, 27, responded on Instagram with a series of videos and memes poking fun at his nemesis. In one, Brown mentioned his 2-year-old daughter, Royalty, saying, ""Happy New Year! Royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than Soulja Boy already. I'd be mad too.""  The ""Grass Ain't Greener"" singer also slammed Soulja Boy for dragging Rihanna, 28, into the spat, saying, ""This s–t is beneath me. I want to bring black people together, but you gotta get your ass whooped, my n—a. Because at the end of the day, what's the first joke you had? The Rihanna joke, my n—a? I was 17. I'm 27 now. You can get a grown man ass whoopin'.""  The feud continued on Tuesday, January 3, when Tran responded, writing in a since-deleted Instagram post: ""First off this drama between the both of these two is so ridiculous it makes no sense. We just brought in a new year and this is what we doing?? … This isn't cool or funny.. it's draining.. not just for me.. but for everyone. There's so much more out there in life then 'twitter beefs.' … I been chillen.. working.. eating my veggies.. hitting these squats and minding my own business and that's exactly how I want to keep it.""  Moments later, Brown replied to his ex's post, writing, ""NOONE ASKED FOR THIS OPINION!!! IT AINT OVER YOU!! GIRL KEEP THE FAME YOU GOT AND STAY CLASSY! … IM SO SICK OF N—AS COMING AT ME LEFT AND RIGHT AND NOW SHE WANNA CHIME IN. NOBODY GIVES A F—K. … ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU WAS CHRIS BROWNS GIRL! AND THE OTHER FRIENDS YOU STILL TALK TO…. I F–KED. So advice from bitches that had my d–k in they mouth is really not informative!""  And just when we thought it was over, Soulja Boy chimed in again, tweeting, ""F–k Chris brown. Bitch ass n—a ain't nothing but a woman I wish he hit my sister like he did Rihanna I would beat his ass. The difference between me and Chris is I shot a N—a before. And he hit a woman before. We not the same.""  Brown and Tran dated on and off for four years until March 2015, when the model called it quits after finding out the singer had fathered his daughter, Royalty, with another woman while they were together.

"Despite having a new baby at home, Kanye West has been M.I.A., leaving Kim Kardashian to care for their newborn herself — and the reality star is livid, according to a new report.  Third time may not be the charm for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West! The rapper is reportedly completely ignoring his duties as a new dad in the weeks since the couple’s daughter, Chicago West, was born. Just days after Chicago’s birth, Kanye jetted off to New York for several days, leaving Kim home alone with all three kids, and when he is home, he’s been refusing to change diapers or wake up for late night feedings, according to Star. “Kim let it slide the first time, but she was counting on counting on Kanye to help out around the house because she already has her hands full,” the mag’s insider claims. “Kim was furious when Kanye told her to just hire another nanny. She made it clear that he petter start pulling his weight — or else.”  Chicago was born via surrogate on Jan. 15, and is just one of the newest additions to the Kardashian family. On Feb. 1, Kylie Jenner, 20, gave birth to her first child — a baby girl named Stormi Webster. That means Kim and Kylie’s daughters are less than one month apart, and Kim wrote the sweetest message to her little sis about it. “I’m so incredibly proud of the woman you have grown up to be and I know that you are going to be the best mom to your new baby girl!” she gushed. “Our girls are two weeks apart and I can’t wait for them to be besties! I am so proud that you do what you want to do and live your life the way you want you will pass down all of those amazing qualities to your baby girl. You were made to be a mom!”  Meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is currently pregnant with her first child, and is due at the end of March/beginning of April — so there’ll be another little one added to the mix in just a couple of months!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye will step up as a dad?",0

"For Suri Cruise, seeing Dad has been a mission impossible. Multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that Tom Cruise has had essentially ""no contact"" with the 10-year-old daughter he shares with ex-wife Katie Holmes.  ""Tom hasn't seen or even called Suri in about three years,"" claims a family source. Alleges another insider, ""Tom has no relationship with Suri.""  In fact, the last time Cruise, 54, and his youngest daughter were photographed publicly was in August 2012, when he took her to Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Cruise has two older children, Connor, 21, and Isabella, 23, with his second ex-wife, Nicole Kidman.)  Holmes, 37, and Cruise, a devout Scientologist, began dating in the spring of 2005 and announced their engagement that June. They welcomed Suri the following April, and tied the knot in front of more than 150 guests at a lavish wedding at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, on November 18, 2006.  Six years later, in June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce. At the time, an insider told Us Holmes didn't want her daughter raised in Scientology and homeschooled by church teachers: ""She wanted Suri to go to a normal school with regular kids."" In the years since, NYC-based Holmes and Suri have since been “excommunicated” from Cruise's life because of his religion, according to the family source. (The insider adds that Cruise ""still sees"" Connor and Isabella, who are both church members.)  Many ex-Scientologists have claimed leaders force members to shun anyone who leaves the church. But a rep for the Church of Scientology tells Us, ""We never comment on individual parishioners' lives. On the issue of Church religious practices, we do not know who your anonymous sources are, but they got it all wrong. The answer to your question is no. Scientologists respect the faith of others, associate with and befriend members of every religion. Scientologists do not cut ties with non-Scientologist friends or family members because they have chosen another religion. Given that Scientology is a new religion, Scientologists often have family members and friends who are not Scientologists and who may practice another faith or no faith at all. This causes no conflict for Scientologists.""  Cruise’s rep had no comment.

"© 2016 Getty Images (Getty Images)  Selena Gomez did NOT break the “girl code” with Taylor Swift, despite a ridiculous report. Gossip Cop can expose the absurdity of this inane story.  HollywoodLife dramatically writes, “Did Selena Gomez just break girl code AGAIN? She and The Weeknd spent a romantic date night at John Mayer’s concert, but there’s a catch. The ‘Good For You’ singer’s BFF Taylor Swift used to date John… so shouldn’t she stay far away?” According to the webloid, “hanging out with your BFF’s ex-boyfriend seems off limits,” but Gomez “may have committed that cardinal sin” by attending John’s show.  “Selena is spending time with John — Taylor’s ex,” declares the site, noting, “Some fans think she’s breaking girl code for the second time now. Ouch!” And yet HollywoodLies actually has no evidence whatsoever that Gomez is “spending time” with Mayer or “hanging out” with him. In truth, the two just happened to be at the same star-studded night club, in separate groups, with the crooner giving an impromptu performance.  It’s amazing that the bad blog twisted that into Gomez having a “date night at John Mayer’s concert,” committing a “cardinal sin,” and “breaking girl code.” This is nothing more than a hit piece, one designed to rile up fans and score clicks. Gomez didn’t do anything to break her “girl code” with Swift, but HollywoodLies once again managed to break several codes of journalism, like accuracy, with this sensational story.  Of course, this isn’t surprising in the least. After all, we’re talking about the same disreputable outlet that spent most of 2014 falsely claiming Gomez and Swift were in a feud. Three years later, the site is still feuding with the facts.",0
"On Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey paid a visit to Recy Taylor’s grave.  She documented the poignant moment and shared it on Instagram. Taylor, an activist and sexual assault survivor, passed away in December. In 1944, she was raped and assaulted by six white men, sparking nationwide outrage. The incident inspired her to speak out about sexual assault and civil rights.  In her caption on Instagram, Winfrey wrote: “I don’t believe in coincidences, but if I did this would be a powerful one. On assignment for @60minutes I end up in the town of Abbeville where #RecyTaylor suffered injustice, endured and recently died.”  The media mogul paid tribute to Taylor in her Golden Globes speech earlier this month, highlighting the #TimesUp movement and the strength of sexual assault survivors.  “For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power to those men, but their time is up. Their time is up!” Winfrey said in her speech. “I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing… her truth, even now, goes marching on.”  Reflecting on her time visiting Taylor’s grave, Winfrey added, “To be able to visit her grave so soon after ‘speaking her name ‘sharing her story, a woman I never knew.

"Image copyright EPA Image caption Rebel Wilson won a defamation lawsuit against Bauer Media last year  An Australian court has ordered actress Rebel Wilson to repay the majority of her record defamation payout from a magazine publisher.  Wilson had received A$4.7m (£2.6m; $3.5m) in damages and interest from Bauer Media over articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar.  But a court reduced the sum to A$600,000 earlier this month following an appeal by the publisher.  On Wednesday, Wilson was ordered to pay back A$4.1m and A$60,000 in interest.  She will also have to cover 80% of what Bauer spent on its appeal.  Wilson, an Australian star of Hollywood films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, has vowed to give all of her compensation to charity.  In its original finding, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded her A$650,000 in general damages and $A3.9m for film roles she had lost out on. She was later paid A$180,000 in interest.  However the size of the payout, Australia's largest for a defamation case, was reduced significantly on appeal.  Ahead of the appeal case - which Wilson did not attend in person - the actress was keen to point out that the court was not reconsidering whether she had won her case, but merely the amount paid out.  The Victorian Court of Appeal ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on film roles.  The actress wrote on Twitter at the time: ""That's now $4 million less going to less fortunate Australians and leaves a billionaire corporation, proven guilty of malicious defamation, being able to get away with their seriously harmful acts for a very low pay day.""  The size of the original payout also generated discussion in Australia over whether it could stifle future journalism in the public interest.",1
"Share  So you watched Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi, which hit movie theaters in December 2017, and you’re itching for hints about what’s to come? There are plenty of interesting details emerging about the upcoming Star Wars: Episode IX, including a few persistent rumors that have fans buzzing.  The latest trilogy of Star Wars films will conclude with Episode IX, which brings back director J.J. Abrams to close out the latest arc of the iconic sci-fi saga after he helmed 2015’s franchise-relaunching Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens. He directs from a script he co-wrote with Academy Award winner Chris Terrio (Argo, Justice League).  The sequel trilogy’s final chapter is scheduled to hit theaters December 20, 2019. Here is everything we know about the movie so far.  Rumor patrol: Knights of Ren, Lando’s daughter  As with any Star Wars movie, there’s no shortage of rumors circling Episode IX, and a few have sparked quite a bit of discussion in mainstream circles.  A rumor suggesting that Lando Calrissian’s daughter could play a role in Episode IX is highlighted on Wired, with the unconfirmed, unofficial report going on to identify actress Naomi Ackie as the person portraying “Veranada Calrissian” in the film.  The mysterious Knights of Ren were also the subject of a popular rumor making the rounds, with ComicBook.com reporting that a person present at a Disney marketing event confirmed that the shadowy group seen in Episode VII – The Force Awakens and led by Kylo Ren will indeed be in Episode IX. “They will definitely be in the next movie,” writes the unidentified source. “They did show numerous pictures/artwork of them.”  The Doctor is in  One of cinema’s most popular sci-fi franchises will draw from the ranks of one of television’s longest-running sci-fi sagas.  In late August, former Doctor Who star Matt Smith (pictured above) was reported to be the latest casting addition to Episode IX.  Smith, who played the 11th Doctor in the wildly popular British sci-fi series and recently earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his performance in the Netflix series The Crown, will play an unidentified “key role” in the Star Wars sequel, according to Variety.  A bittersweet beginning  Abrams commemorated the August 1 start of production on Episode IX with his first post on Twitter, which acknowledged the absence of franchise veteran Carrie Fisher on the set and thanked Episode VIII director Rian Johnson and Star Wars creator George Lucas for getting the saga to this point.  Bittersweet starting this next chapter without Carrie, but thanks to an extraordinary cast and crew, we are ready to go. Grateful for @rianjohnson and special thanks to George Lucas for creating this incredible world and beginning a story of which we are lucky to be a part. #IX pic.twitter.com/FOfnGwVut5 — JJ Abrams (@jjabrams) August 1, 2018  Official cast  On July 27, Lucasfilm’s official Star Wars page listed the major cast list, including the big names returning and those joining anew the latest film in the franchise. And yes, that means Billy Dee Williams will officially return as the iconic Lando Calrissian, as will Mark Hamill which, for reasons we won’t specify here, may come as a surprise to some. Follow below for the official cast list:  Officially returning for Episode IX are Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, and Billie Lourd.  Joining the cast for their first Star Wars experience are Naomi Ackie (Dr. Who), Richard E. Grant, and Keri Russell. In addition, veteran Star Wars actors returning include Williams (as promised), Hamill (Luke Skywalker), and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO).  But those aren’t the only familiar faces coming back. The announcement states that the late Carrie Fisher’s character, Leia Organa, will also return for the film “using previously unreleased footage shot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” This may come as a surprise to some following news that no CG version of Fisher’s character would be used for Episode IX (seemingly implying Leia would not return). However, Episode IX director J.J. Abrams made a statement to alleviate concerns.  “We desperately loved Carrie Fisher,” Abrams said. “Finding a truly satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga without her eluded us. We were never going to recast, or use a CG character. With the support and blessing from her daughter, Billie, we have found a way to honor Carrie’s legacy and role as Leia in Episode IX by using unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII.”  The decision to use previous footage obviously wasn’t an easy one to make, in a situation with no perfect way out. The film’s producers were seemingly still struggling with the decision as recently as April, when Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy indicated in an interview on Good Morning America that Fisher was no longer expected to appear in Episode IX.  A tricky new title  Star Wars films are notorious for using working titles to throw off the public and keep production costs low in terms of locations and services. Episode VI — Return of the Jedi was shot under the guise of a horror movie called Blue Harvest. Meanwhile, Episode II — Attack of the Clones poked fun at the negative response to prequel trilogy’s Gungan leader with the title Jar-Jar’s Big Adventure.  Sometimes the production title can offer clues, though they may not make sense until after the film is released. Fantha Tracks has reported that the working title for Episode IX will be trIXie. The site claims that “the same research methods and public sources were used by the same team to uncover the production names of every Disney-era Star Wars film to date.”  The Force Awakens was shot under the title AVCO, which Bleeding Cool reported was the name of the theater in Los Alamos where a young J.J. Abrams saw the first Star Wars film. So what does trIXie refer to, if anything? It appears to simply be a way to get the roman numeral for the number 9 in the title, but there could be more to it, and we will circle back when we have more information.  Reunion time  Following in the footsteps of the Star Wars trilogies that came before it, the current three-part story arc had its main characters separating in Episode VIII — The Last Jedi, the middle chapter of the saga (much like the characters did in Episode II — Attack of the Clones and Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back). As with those previous trilogies, though, they’re expected to reunite in the third chapter — at least, that’s what franchise actor John Boyega seems to think.  Asked about Episode IX during a convention in Washington, D.C., Boyega said he expects the film to bring together his character, Finn, with Daisy Ridley’s character, Rey. The pair has been separated since the events of Episode VII — The Force Awakens, but that period apart could be nearing its end.  “I haven’t read the script for Episode IX,” he said (via SlashFilm). “But Daisy did shoot me a text saying, ‘Oh my gosh, I just heard from J.J. [Abrams], and we’re back together.’ That’s what I’m really excited about, is Finn and Rey back together again.”  Different endings, same result?  While discussing the differences in working with Star Wars directors J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson, Hamill revealed how the creator of the sci-fi saga, Lucas, planned to handle the later years of his iconic character, Luke Skywalker.  “I happen to know that George didn’t kill Luke until the end of [Episode] IX, after he trained Leia,” Hamill told IGN. “Which is another thread that was never played upon [in The Last Jedi].”  Although most of Lucas’ plans for a sequel trilogy were reportedly scrapped when Disney took over the franchise, The Last Jedi did get to a point with some of its main characters that has a lot in common with those early outlines. Luke’s death occurred one episode earlier, and Leia (Carrie Fisher) did show some aptitude with The Force in Johnson’s 2017 film.  “George had an overall arc — if he didn’t have all the details, he had sort of an overall feel for where the [sequel trilogy was] going — but this [sequel trilogy] is more like a relay race,” Hamill said of the current saga, which appears to be letting its creative teams take the over-arching events in some unexpected directions, too. “You run and hand the torch off to the next guy, he picks it up and goes.”  The rich get richer  Whatever your thoughts about Episode VIII, most can agree that it was a visually spectacular film. Scenes like the throne room saber battle and Vice Admiral Holdo’s lightspeed strike were breathtaking, thanks to some excellent art direction and production design. Now, the team for Episode IX has a new, distinguished member: Paul Inglis, who served as art director for the excellent (and gorgeous) Blade Runner 2049.  Thanks to a report from Omega Underground, we know Inglis has been tapped as the supervising art director for Episode IX, where he will work alongside Abrams and the production team to define the film’s aesthetic. Inglis’ previous credits also include Skyfall, Game of Thrones, Prometheus, and Children of Men.  A different kind of ship  Some Star Wars fans saw Rey (Ridley) and Poe (Isaac) meet in The Last Jedi and started hoping it was their meet-cute. The single scene was enough to fuel shipping rumors — so much so that Ridley had to answer a question about it during a promotional event in China. Redditor Niamor89 posted a video (via Sleemo) showing the actress discussing the two Resistance fighters’ possible romantic future. Put simply, she doesn’t really want them to have one.  “It’s wonderful to have relationships that are not romantic,” Ridley said. “I don’t think in films you always need a romantic relationship. I think friend relationships can be romantic in their gestures and their intimacy and all of that. So I think, hopefully — you know, if Rey and Poe get to have some scenes together and stuff — that there will be intimacy, but I think, for me, it doesn’t have to be romantic love.”  If that breaks your heart, know that Ridley hasn’t spoken to Abrams about it yet, so it is still possible that he has other plans.  Location on loch  The next installment of the Star Wars franchise might be headed to the highlands — the county of Argyll in the Scottish Highlands, to be precise.  A report in Scotland’s Daily Record indicates that a new Star Wars movie will begin filming in the western Scottish county of Argyll in June, with shooting expected to place in the historic mountain pass known as the Rest and Be Thankful. Although the initial report suggests that it’s Johnson’s spinoff trilogy that will be filming in Argyll, there’s almost no chance whatsoever that cameras will begin rolling on the first film in that series during 2018 — so if a Star Wars movie does indeed begin shooting in Argyll, it’s likely to be Abrams’ Episode IX.  Parent problems, redux  Although The Last Jedi seemed to offer some resolution regarding the mystery of Rey’s lineage, Johnson indicated in an interview with Huffington Post that fans might not have heard the end of that particular identity crisis.  Disney  “Anything’s still open, and I’m not writing the next film. [Abrams and Terrio] are doing it,” said Johnson while discussing the revelation about Rey’s parents that has become one of the most polarizing aspects of the film.  Their story will go on  Don’t let the description of Episode IX as a “concluding chapter” mislead you: The stars of the sequel trilogy aren’t going away.  In a November 2017 interview featured on The Star Wars Show, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy indicated that many of the main characters introduced in Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens will continue their stories in Episode IX and beyond the sequel trilogy.  “We’re sitting down now, we’re talking about the next 10 years of Star Wars stories, and we’re looking at, narratively, where that might go,” Kennedy said. “Future stories beyond Episode IX with these new characters — Rey, Poe, Finn, BB-8 — but we’re also looking at working with people who are interested in coming into the Star Wars world and taking us places we haven’t been yet. That’s exciting too because it’s a vast galaxy far, far away.”  Going back to the beginning  After original Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow exited the project in September 2017 due to creative differences with the studio, it didn’t take long for Disney and Lucasfilm to find a new filmmaker to helm the movie — and he was a familiar face to fans of the franchise.  Abrams was named the new director of the film just a week after the post was vacated, with the film’s new co-writer Terrio was also announced at that time.  “With The Force Awakens, J.J. delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for, and I am so excited that he is coming back to close out this trilogy,” Kennedy said in a statement on StarWars.com.  Given the success of Abrams’ franchise-relaunching sequel The Force Awakens, the decision to bring him back for Episode IX seems like a safe bet for the studio.  Released in 2015, The Force Awakens went on to break a slew of box office records, earning $936.6 million in U.S. theaters and more than $2 billion worldwide. It’s currently the highest-grossing movie of all time domestically, and in third place on the all-time worldwide box office charts (after Avatar and Titanic). The film also received overwhelmingly positive reviews from professional critics and fans alike, and currently ranks third (after Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strike Back and the franchise-starting Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope) and among the best-reviewed films in the franchise on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.  Release date, updated  Not too long after Abrams was announced as the director of Episode IX, the film also received a new release date.  Star Wars: Episode IX will officially hit theaters December 20, 2019, several months later than its original release date of May 24, 2019.  The new release date has the film arriving in theaters just a week after the sequel to Wonder Woman, and on the same weekend as a live-action feature based on the popular Broadway musical Wicked. It also allows the film to carry on the tradition set by the two serialized installments of the Star Wars franchise that immediately precedes it, Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi, which were both assigned December premieres.

"America's most lovable James Corden learned the hard way that not everything is a laughing matter.  On Friday night The Late Late Show star hosted a glittering star-studded amfAR Los Angeles Gala honoring Julia Roberts—and while captaining the charity event, the funnyman couldn't help but to throw a few jabs at disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of both assault and rape.  But many people of the Internet didn't think his words were so funny and the entertainer faced some serious online backlash for his remarks.  The Brit took to Twitter on Sunday to apologize, writing, ""To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey’s inexcusable behavior, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention.""",0
"Jennifer Lawrence‘s obsession over Keeping Up with the Kardashians has developed into a close friendship with Kris Jenner. So close, in fact, that she gave the KarJenner momager a car for Christmas!  Well, sort of.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Kris, 62, revealed all on Instagram Saturday, posting a shot of the holiday present.  Kris Jenner/Instagram  “My BFF #Jenniferlawrence asked me what i wanted for Christmas and of course I said a Porsche, DUH. My girl didn’t disappoint,” Kris wrote.  Of course, instead of getting Kris an actual Porsche, Lawrence gifted a toy one — which fit perfectly next to the mother of six’s beloved giant metal-and-glass red polar bear (named “Christmas”) in her elegant foyer, decorated with rainbow-themed decor for the holidays.  “Thank you Jen I love you!!!” Kris said. “#bffsforever #christmassurprise #jlaw #soexcited”  REALTED: Kris Jenner’s Christmas Polar Bear Is Back as She Decorates Home In an Extravagant Rainbow Theme  The tiny white vehicle will be perfect for Kris’ six grandkids (Kim Kardashian West‘s kids North, 4, and Saint, 2; Kourtney Kardashian‘s kids Reign, 3, Penelope, 5, and Mason, 8; and Rob Kardashian‘s daughter Dream, 1).  There’s also three more grandkids on the way in the new year — a baby girl from Kim and husband Kanye West (via surrogate); a baby boy, from Khloé Kardashian and boyfriend Tristan Thompson; and another baby girl from Kylie Jenner and boyfriend Travis Scott.  RELATED: Jennifer Lawrence & Kim Kardashian Reveal the Actress Got ‘Drunk’ With Kris Jenner & Stripped Naked in Her Closet  Lawrence, 27, will no doubt be sending gifts when those babies arrive too.  She’s been tight with the KarJenner family ever since Kris decided to surprise the Oscar winning actress with a birthday cake a few years ago.  “When I walked out with this cake she was so excited and so excited to see me, and then we had this little texting friendship from then on,” Kris told Steve Harvey on his talk show in November. “It was fun. She’s such a great girl.”  Things have only gotten closer since then. In November, Lawrence revealed before interviewing Kim on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that she had gotten drunk and stripped down to nearly nothing in Kris’ closet.  “I drank five martinis and wound up naked in her closet, I’m dead serious,” Lawrence said during her opening monologue, later adding that the evening “was everything I could’ve ever dreamed of.”",1

"Gisele Bündchen eats meat just twice a month, consumes only goat and sheep cheese, and drinks beet juice when she is menstruating - but the supermodel doesn't believe she is particularly strict when it comes to her diet.  In her new book, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life, the 38-year-old describes in detail the whole-food, plant-based diet that her entire family follows thanks to their personal chef, Susan, who comes to their home five days a week.  After oil-pulling and meditating first thing in the morning, Gisele says she begins her days with a glass of lukewarm water combined with half a lemon.  Role model: Gisele Bündchen has opened up about her whole-food, plant based diet  Epitome of health: The 38-year-old model's diet consists mainly of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, with the occasional piece of meat or fish  For breakfast, she makes her children, Benjamin, eight, and Vivian, five, 'gluten-free toast with almond butter and honey, or eggs with sliced avocado, or a bowl of cut-up apples and berries with coconut yogurt.'  If she doesn't end up nibbling on their breakfasts, she likes to have a glass of green juice while making her kids' lunches.  Gisele's typical juice recipe includes celery, cucumbers, half of a red or green apple, turmeric, ginger, lemon juice, and sometimes she adds kale or beets.  Juicy read: Gisele wrote about her lifestyle in her new book, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life  'If I'm having period, I'll often just do beets and lemon for extra iron and vitamin C,' she explains.  However, she will opt for a smoothie made up of fresh or frozen berries, some cacao, hemp seed, flax seed, chia seed, and a 'splash' of coconut milk if she has a grueling workout planned that day.  Depending on how she is feeling, she also sometimes adds banana, almond butter, or protein powder to the mix.  For lunch, she typically has a salad with seed crackers and avocado or a bowl of soup with chickpeas and vegetables. In the summer, she likes to make homemade springs rolls with tahini sauce.  The majority of their meals consist of 'raw or lightly steamed vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, with the occasional small piece of meat or seafood added into the mix.'  After dinner, Gisele says she likes to make chamomile tea for her and her kids, but she tries not to drink anything when she is eating.  She explains her mother taught her and her sisters 'that it's too hard on the digestive system,' so she refrains from drinking during meals. After she is done eating, she waits at least 30 minutes before having any liquids.  Looking back: In her book, Gisele reveals she took her husband, Tom Brady, and his friend Kevin to a raw, organic vegan restaurant in New York just a few weeks after she met  Influence: The 41-year-old New England Patriots quarterback drastically changed his diet after Gisele hired them a personal chef while he was recovering from an ACL injury in 2007  Gisele says she is 'such a big snacker,' but she opts for nuts and hummus with veggies instead of processed snacks like chips and crackers.  Although Gisele and her husband, Tom Brady, 41, are widely believed to lead gluten- and dairy-free lifestyles, she says that's not the case.  'I happen to love eating goat cheese and sheep cheese, though I have stayed away from cow dairy ever since I had a test that showed I have an intolerance to it,' she explains.  At home, they drink homemade coconut milk (her favorite) as well as almond milk and hemp milk.  Gisele insists that when friends come over for dinner, she will serve a cheese platter with nuts and honey.  'Not five pounds of cheese, mind you, but a small portion—a Midnight Moon, a Manchego, and maybe some cashew cheese,' she says.  The avocado to her toast: While Gisele credits herself with getting Tom to eat better, she notes that he is so dedicated to being healthy their 'preferences came together naturally.'  Schedule: Gisele admits she tried to be a vegetarian on two separate occasions but ended up developing anemia. She now has meat twice a month and fish once a week  'I think it's difficult to deprive yourself of something you love, and I happen to love cheese. I just eat it sparingly.'  She and her family will occasionally eat organic, whole grain wheat, and they have pasta about once a week. However, it is usually gluten-free rice pasta or quinoa pasta because she thinks it 'tastes better than wheat pasta anyway.'  Gisele, who says she is 'not too strict' with her diet, claims to have quite the sweet tooth, though most of their 'desserts are a blend of avocado and coconut,' which she believes are the best fats she and her family can eat.  They use fresh honey and dates to sweeten things, but she admits to loving dark chocolate.  'I have chocolate every day, even if it's only a bite; and if I have PMS, it's going to be way more than a bite,' she explains.  Interestingly enough, she says she always has a small dessert after lunch.  Slim secret? The model refrains from drinking during meals because 'it's too hard on the digestive system': After she's done eating, she waits at least 30 minutes before having liquids  Start of her day: After having a glass of lukewarm water combined with half a lemon, Gisele says she likes to have a green juice for breakfast  They all love it! Back in 2015, Gisele shared this sweet photo of her now five-year-old daughter, Vivian, sipping on some of her green juice  Gisele also says she loves thin-crust pizza with 'very little cheese, typically burrata.' Of course, she isn't eating any old pizza.  A family friend who owns a chain of pizzerias that uses 'high-quality Italian ingredients' will send them batches to make 'on those special Saturday nights.'  The mother-of-two likes to take everyone's leftover crusts and dip them in French butter, another one of her weaknesses.  'You don't find me standing in the kitchen at one a.m. devouring ice cream, but once I start eating French butter, I just can't stop,' she confesses.  As for alcohol, Gisele says she doesn't indulge very often, but when she does, she will have a glass of red wine or two on special occasions.  Every now and then she will also have a margarita while on vacation. She stresses that she has nothing against drinking; she just doesn't like how it makes her feel the next morning.  Routine: Gisele's typical juice recipe includes celery, cucumbers, half of a red or green apple, turmeric, ginger, and lemon juice, but she'll do just beets and lemon if she is menstruating  Model behavior: Gisele is also a fan of fasting, but she insists it doesn't have anything to do with weight loss. She says detoxing gives her 'clarity and more energy'  Fit inside and out: In addition to her extremely healthy diet, Gisele gets acupuncture as well as intravenous shots of vitamins from her doctor twice a year  Although they are now known for their incredibly healthy diets, Gisele and Tom weren't always as health conscious. In fact, Gisele says Tom used to eat whatever was in his football team's cafeteria before she got him eating healthy.  The mother-of-two took Tom and his friend Kevin to a raw, organic vegan restaurant in New York just a few weeks after she met the New England Patriots quarterback.  However, their diets didn't drastically change until Tom suffered an ACL injury in 2007. While he was recuperating in Los Angeles, Gisele met a a caterer who delivered healthy organic food to a photo shoot she was working.  She asked him if he would be interested in working for them, and he started delivering food to their home three times a week.  'Once Tom started eating clean, delicious organic foods, he felt much better, and it wasn't too hard for him to give up his old diet,' she explains. 'We both decided that we wanted to keep eating this way, even after we returned to Boston.'  While Gisele credits herself with getting Tom to eat better, she notes that he is so dedicated to being healthy their 'preferences came together naturally.'  Misconceptions: Although Gisele and Tom are widely believed to lead gluten- and dairy-free lifestyles, she says that's not the case  Splurges: Gisele says she and her family will occasionally eat organic, whole grain wheat. She also loves goat and sheep cheese  Much like Tom, she wasn't always the healthy eater that she is now. In her book, she recalls eating meat almost every day when she was growing up in the south of Brazil.  As an animal lover, she admits that she tried and failed to be a vegetarian twice before realizing she needs to incorporate some meat into her diet.  During her first attempt at vegetarianism, which lasted a year and a half, Gisele says she became 'extremely anemic' and 'felt tired all the time.'  She noticed her fingernails were flaky and the skin beneath her eyes was white instead of pink. When she spoke with her doctor, he advised her to reintroduce meat into her diet.  A few years later, Gisele became for a vegetarian for a second time, but she only lasted ten months before getting anemic again.  'Currently I eat meat twice a month, and seafood once a week. I pay careful attention to the source of my meat and the types of fish I eat,' she explains, noting that she and her family make a point to eat smaller fish because her doctor told her that larger fish contain greater concentrations of mercury.  Although Gisele loves to cook, she says she doesn't have time because of her busy schedule. Their personal chef, Susan, comes to their home five days a week to cook healthy, seasonal meals for them.  All planned out: The couple's personal chef, Susan, comes to their home five days a week to cook healthy, seasonal meals for them  Sweet tooth: Gisele says most of their 'desserts are a blend of avocado and coconut.' She also loves dark chocolate and has it daily  She even helps Gisele's children plant vegetables and herbs in their garden. After leaning that bees are dying because of pesticides, she and Tom decided to get two hives.  For Gisele, it's not just about what she eats, but it is about when and how she eats it.  The couple, who prefer to eat seasonally, are members of a local community-supported agriculture farm, which provides them with a box vegetables and fruits that are in season.  In the summer, she eats more salads and raw foods, including fruits and vegetables, while in the winter, she has heartier meals such as hot soups and root vegetables.  The mother-of-two says she is also a 'big believer' in small portions and mindful eating, though she used to feel guilty for leaving any food on her plate.  'It's really hard on your digestion to take in a lot of food all at once,' she said, noting that if she is still really hungry, she knows she can always have more.  Her mother always taught her to chew her food, at least 20 times. While she is still trying to eat as slowly and thoughtfully as her mom does, Gisele says her her goal is 'to turn every meal into a form of meditation.'  No picky eaters here! Gisele says her children like to eat vegetables because they were raised eating plant-based foots  Not anymore! Before she got married and had children, Gisele used to go on on silent meditation retreats where she would be on a juice fast for three or four days  Family photo: Gisele is also stepmom to Tom's 11-year-old son Jack (right), his only child with Bridget Moynahan  In addition to her extremely healthy diet, Gisele takes vitamin C, a B multivitamin, and vitamin D. She also gets acupuncture as well as intravenous shots of vitamins from her doctor twice a year.  Gisele is also a fan of fasting, but she insists it doesn't have anything to do with weight loss. Twice a week, she likes to wait until lunch to eat, even if she is working out.  She will do a liquid fast when she is sick, and once a year she will go a month without consuming any sugar, including fruit sugar and the sugars from grains and alcohol.  Before she got married and had children, Gisele used to go on on silent meditation retreats where she would be on a juice fast for three or four days. She insists detoxing gives her 'clarity and more energy.'  Although she will still do the occasional juice cleanse, she doesn't do them in the winter because she believes the body needs energy and fats to combat the cold.  'But I don't do fasts as a form of weight control,' she says. 'I maintain my weight through my lifestile. I eat clean, and I drink a lot of water and tea throughout the day.  'Whether I'm eating or exercising, it's all about gaining energy and clarity while re-centering myself.  'We are what we eat!'",1
"Lil Dicky's ""Freaky Friday"" featuring Chris Brown was an unforeseen smash hit for the Philly comedy-rapper, debuting at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. The success of Dicky's bonkers track about switching bodies with Brown seemed to leave the rapper himself in awe, telling Billboard recently: ""It's validating to see a song be so mainstream while being so quirky and weird.""  Now, you can get familiar with the zany, quotable lyrics to ""Freaky Friday"" below, while you wonder who you'd switch bodies with if given the opportunity.

"Seacrest … in!  After months of talks and speculation, Ryan Seacrest will officially return to host the “American Idol” revival on ABC. The network made the announcement after Seacrest broke the news on Thursday morning’s “Live With Kelly and Ryan.”  Seacrest will earn about $12 million for his role on the show this season, but will not receive credit as an executive producer. He will, however, have creative consultation and approval on judges and other production issues, Variety has confirmed. Sources say the negotiations were protracted due to questions about his complicated schedule and other commitments.  Seacrest served as host for the franchise during its 15-season run on Fox, which aired its “farewell season” last year. The multihyphenate will continue to co-host and executive produce “Live With Kelly and Ryan” from New York in addition to hosting and executive producing his iHeartRadio-syndicated morning radio show “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience. It’s been an incredible journey from day one. To be asked to return this year, at my new home at Disney|ABC, is an honor, if not a bit surreal. I believe ABC is the perfect home for ‘Idol,’ and I’ve every confidence the show’s legions of fans will love it — especially “Idol’s” best traditions of showcasing heartwarming stories, remarkable talent discovery, and, best of all, making dreams come true.”  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said she attributes much of “American Idol’s” success to Seacrest.  Related Inside CNN's Frenzied and Sometimes Freaky New Year's Eve Comedy Series Inspired by Kelly Ripa, Ryan Seacrest Gets Put Pilot Order at ABC  “We are thrilled to be ushering in this new era of ‘American Idol’ with Ryan at the helm,” Dungey said. “So much of “American Idol’s” overwhelming success can be attributed to Ryan, whose larger-than- life personality and laudable dedication to creating quality entertainment has made him a true master of his craft. His talent is limitless, and I can’t think of a more appropriate person to honor the ‘Idol’ legacy as it takes on new life than the man who has been there through it all.”  Variety reported in May that ABC, which beat out other networks to bring the singing competition back to the air, committed to broadcasting about 40 hours of the program — making it likely that the show will air over two nights most weeks, like it did on Fox.  Katy Perry joined “American Idol” as a judge in May, becoming the first onscreen talent to board the reboot.  Live auditions for the reality series begin in August. The show returns on ABC in 2018.  “American Idol” is produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, a division of CORE Media Group. The executive producers include FremantleMedia North America’s Trish Kinane and Jennifer Mullin, along with co-executive producer Megan Wolflick. FremantleMedia International distributes the series worldwide.  “‘Idol’ wouldn’t be ‘Idol’ without Ryan,” said Core Media Group CEO Peter Hurwitz. “We’re delighted that he’s joining us and ABC as we set out to uncover the amazing talent America has to offer,” added Kinane, FremantleMedia’s president of entertainment programming.",1
"A source close to Robert Pattinson has suggested that his engagement to singer FKA Twigs is on the outs–and that he may be moving on with Katy Perry. “He is technically still with FKA Twigs, but it doesn’t seem like it will last,“ an insider tells E! News. “They were serious at one point, but not anymore.” The source goes on to say that the 31-year-old actor has been good friends with Perry for several years, but that “you never know what will happen in the future.“ “Rob already feels single. He and FKA have had major distance and tension between them for months now,“ the informant continues. “They really tried to make it work, and it’s not long until the split will be public. They have just been trying to figure out how to sort everything.“ Pattinson made headlines in July after he said he’s only “kind of“ engaged to Twigs during a radio interview.

"Ivanka Trump is on the cover of the newest issue of Us Weekly with a story titled, ""Ivanka Takes a Stand: Why I Disagree with My Dad."" The subtitle elaborates: ""Balancing her personal ideals with love and loyalty to her father, the president's daughter will always fight for what she believes in.""  Interesting.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  The story states that the First Daughter has disagreed with her father on ""everything from LGBT rights to the North American Free Trade Agreement."" She reportedly even ""openly tried to sway him"" to remain in the Paris Agreement (which President Trump withdrew from last week).  Naturally, the internet promptly responded to the cover story in a genius way.

"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",0

"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War.  You expected superheroes to die in Avengers: Infinity War. You probably didn’t expect so many superheroes would perish by the end of the film.  The Russo brothers, who directed the film, let audiences know early on that no character was safe: fan favorite Loki is killed off in the first few minutes. Other characters met an ugly fate throughout the movie at the hands of Thanos and his minions, including Gamora (more on that later). But it wasn’t until the very end of the film that heroes began to disappear — literally.  Thanos fulfilled his plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and with the snap of his fingers, people began to disintegrate. But are they really gone? Probably not. Black Panther just broke every record at the box office, and Disney is eager to make a sequel. A second Spider-Man is already in the works. And Marvel has confirmed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will hit theaters in 2020.  How then will the remaining heroes bring all these characters back? Note that all the members of the original Avengers team — Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and (presumably) Hawkeye — survived Thanos’ attack. Presumably they will unite one last time in Avengers 4 next year to reverse the curse.  In the meantime, here is a full list of Avengers: Infinity War deaths and survivals.  Here’s who died in Avengers: Infinity War  Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in Marvel Studios' AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR Marvel Studios  Loki: Turns out Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wasn’t such a bad guy after all. In the opening scene of the movie, Loki hands over the Tesseract to Thanos (Josh Brolin) to save the life of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Loki offers fake fealty to Thanos and then immediately tries to assassinate the evil alien. Thanos doesn’t buy Loki’s trick and quickly murders him. Thanos quips, “No resurrections this time” after killing the trickster god, who has seemingly died twice before in the film series.  Heimdall: Thanos and his children murder Thor’s best friend Heimdall (Idris Elba) when they invade Thor’s ship. But before he dies, the Asgardian opens up a gateway to Earth so the Hulk can escape. Thor cries out when Heimdall perishes, and swears that Thanos will die for his actions. He does sort of avenge Heimdall later by stabbing Thanos, but unfortunately Thanos is already invincible at that point.  Gamora: Thanos travels to a planet with his adopted daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana). There, they encounter Red Skull, the baddie from Captain America: The First Avenger who has been cursed to guard the Soul Stone. Red Skull tells Thanos that he will have to sacrifice something he loves in order to get the Soul Stone. Despite taking a commanding lead in the World’s Worst Dad competition, Thanos apparently loves Gamora — just enough to throw her over a cliff. Gamora dies and Thanos walks away with another Infinity Stone.  Don’t mourn yet though: If the Avengers find a way to reverse all that Thanos has done, they may be able to bring Gamora back. And who better to finally kill the villain in the end?  Vision: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) destroys the Infinity Stone inside Vision’s (Paul Bettany) head to keep it from Thanos. But Thanos uses the Time Stone to turn back time and restore the stone and Vision. He then crushes Vision’s head in his hands and takes the Infinity Stone. Vision is left lifeless on the ground.  Here’s who disintegrated in Avengers: Infinity War  Marvel Studios  Black Panther/T’Challa: Okoye (Danai Gurira) cries out as her king disintegrates. Chadwick Boseman will likely be back, but in the meantime will someone else don the Black Panther suit? Here’s hoping Shuri or Okoye gets to try out his claws.  Spider-Man/Peter Parker: Poor Spider-Man (Tom Holland). He was just a kid. But don’t worry, Spider-Man is already set to appear in a Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel next year, Spider-Man: Far From Home. There is a small chance that Tom Holland’s Spidey really did die, and Miles Morales — another Spider-Man from the comic books whose existence Marvel teased in Homecoming — could take over for him.  Doctor Strange/Stephen Strange: Marvel has been cagey about confirming a Doctor Strange 2 and now we know why. Doctor Strange disintegrates in Infinity War. But he also is the only character who hints that he may be able to return. As he dies, he tells Iron Man that giving up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for Iron Man’s life was the “only way.”  Earlier in the movie, Doctor Strange looked into many possible futures and probably saw that the only way to ultimately defeat Thanos — and possibly bring everyone back —was to lose that particular battle.  Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes and Falcon/Sam Wilson: Many fans have speculated that either Bucky or Falcon will take over the Captain America mantle when Steve Rogers retires. But his time has not come yet: Cap survives but loses his two best friends.  Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff: This loss hurts: Scarlet Witch seems to be the only superhero with the ability to destroy an Infinity Stone. The Avengers will have to find a clever way to destroy the stones as they fight Thanos in the next movie without her.  The Guardians of the Galaxy: Most of the remaining Guardians — Star-Lord, Groot, Drax and Mantis — all perish in the culling. Only Rocket remains. Marvel recently confirmed that the planned Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 movie remains on hold following the dismissal of director James Gunn, so the fates of the Guardians remain up in the air.  Nick Fury and Maria Hill: The former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents disintegrate in New York in a post-credit scene from the film — but not before they call on Captain Marvel for help. (More on her later.)  Hope Pym, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne: Though Hope Pym (the Wasp) and her parents did not appear in Infinity War, they did star in Ant-Man and the Wasp. They all disintegrated in that film’s mid-credits scene.  Shuri: Black Panther’s sister Shuri tries to remove the Infinity Stone from Vision’s head, but is thrown from her lab by one of Thanos’ children before she can finish. We don’t see what happens to her when half the world’s population disappears, but in the trailer for the sequel, Avengers: Endgame, we find out that the Avengers count her among the disappeared.  Here’s who survived Avengers: Infinity War  Chuck Zlotnick—Marvel Studios  Captain America/Steve Rogers: Captain America actor Chris Evans has been suggesting for months that he would die in Infinity War. But when he faces down Thanos one-on-one, Thanos inexplicably decides to toss Cap aside instead of just killing him. Captain America survives.  Iron Man/Tony Stark: Despite being stabbed in the stomach, Iron Man survives. Doctor Strange trades the Time Stone to save Iron Man’s life.  Thor: With the help of his new battle axe, Thor is able to stab Thanos in the heart. Thor survives, but he doesn’t stop Thanos from destroying half the universe.  Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff: Black Widow takes out several of Thanos’ children in the battle in Wakanda and survives the fight.  Hulk/Bruce Banner: Bruce Banner also manages to live despite his inability to turn into the Hulk for most of the movie.  War Machine/James Rhodes: Rhodey lost the use of his legs at the end of Captain America: Civil War (though he can now walk with the aid of Stark technology). At least he made it through the end of Infinity War.  Rocket and Nebula: Of the original Guardians crew, only Rocket survives. Gamora’s sister Nebula also lives. Perhaps the two will reunite in the next film.  Okoye and M’Baku: Black Panther may be dead, but Wakanda lives on. Okoye and M’Baku survive. Likely, one of them — or perhaps Shuri — will have to lead the Wakandan army in any Avengers 4 battles,  Ant-Man/Scott Lang: Though he did not appear in Infinity War itself, a mid-credits scene in Ant-Man and the Wasp revealed that Ant-Man survived the culling. Unfortunately for him, he had entered the Subatomic Realm just before Thanos snapped his fingers. Ant-Man’s allies who were supposed to pull him out—Hope Pym, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne—all disintegrated. But the Avengers: Endgame trailer revealed that he escaped.  Hawkeye/Clint Barton: The archer (Jeremy Renner) was conspicuously missing from Avengers: Infinity War. The stay-at-home dad apparently told the rest of the Avengers that fighting Thanos was too risky. But the Avengers: Endgame trailer revealed that Clint has survived and adopted a darker costume. Fans speculate that he’s taken on a darker identity from the comics too as he seeks to avenge his family: Ronin, a lonely hero.  Here’s who went M.I.A. in Avengers: Infinity War  Pepper Potts: The last we heard from Pepper, she was berating Tony for abandoning her to fight evil — again. We don’t know whether she survived the culling. But if she lived, she could fight in Avengers 4. Never forget: Pepper gained super powers in Iron Man 3. The Avengers: Endgame trailer shows Tony, floating through space, send a goodbye message to Pepper. If she is alive and receives it, she will likely try to save him.  Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers: If you stayed for the post-credit scene, you know that Nick Fury called Captain Marvel right before he disintegrated. The new, extremely powerful hero probably survived the culling and will likely swoop in to help save the day in Avengers: Endgame. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) will also get her own solo film in March of 2019 before Endgame drops.  The Collector: We see the Collector (Benicio del Toro) alive and well in Thanos’ alternate reality, but then discover he’s not actually hanging out in his museum. Did Thanos kill him? Did he flee? Did he survive the culling? We don’t know.  Valkyrie: Where is Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson)? At the end of Thor: Ragnarok, Thor’s new ally Valkyrie boarded the ship bound for earth along with Thor, the Hulk, Loki, Heimdall and the rest of the Asgardians. But we don’t see her dead on the ground when Thanos takes over that same ship at the beginning of Infinity War. Thor makes no mention of her. Did she run out to get chips and guac on an escape pod and miss the whole fight?  Thompson jokingly tweeted in September that Valkyrie was alive “and thriving” after the apocalypse. Fans are hoping that the character will turn up to help Thor in the Infinity War sequel.  Wong and Ned: Wong (Benedict Wong) returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum to protect the building after Doctor Strange is taken captive by Thanos’ children. We never see whether he lives or dies. We also never find out whether Ned, who creates a distraction for his friend Peter Parker to escape a school field trip at the beginning of the movie, lives or dies.

"So exactly what led Renée Zellweger, an Oscar-winning actress, to make her big return to Hollywood in the role of a prophetic housewife in a hackneyed family drama? Well, one theory is that she was desperate for work, which is a lousy position for a star who was once so highly employable to be in. So, accepting whatever middle-aged lady roles she was offered may have made the difference for Zellweger between seeing screen time or not — even if they aren't the kind of movies that would make for an amazing mid-life career renaissance.  There's also a chance Zellweger's just not all that interested in Hollywood anymore, especially when you consider the fact that she disappeared almost as quickly as she reappeared after Bridget Jones' Baby came and went. If that's the case, then we say: Do your thing, Renée! Still, we have our suspicions that Zellweger will break out onto the acting scene once more when the time is right…",1
"Risky Business is a 1983 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Paul Brickman, making his directorial debut. It stars Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay. The film launched Cruise to stardom.[2] It covers themes including materialism, loss of innocence, coming of age and capitalism.  Plot [ edit ]  Joel Goodson is a high-achieving high school student who lives with his wealthy parents in the North Shore area of Chicago. His father wants him to attend Princeton University, his alma mater, so Joel participates in Future Enterprisers, an extracurricular activity in which students work in teams to create small businesses. When his parents go away on a trip, Joel's friend, Miles, convinces him to take advantage of his newfound freedom to have some fun. On the first night, he raids the liquor cabinet, plays the stereo loudly, and dances around the living room in his underwear and pink dress shirt to ""Old Time Rock and Roll"". The following day, Miles calls a call girl named Jackie on Joel's behalf. Jackie turns out to be a tall, masculine transvestite. Joel pays Jackie to go away, but before she leaves, she gives Joel the number for Lana, another prostitute. That night, Joel is unable to sleep and hesitantly calls Lana. She turns out to be a gorgeous blonde and they have sex all night.  Lana asks Joel for $300 for her services. He goes to the bank, but when he returns, Lana is gone, along with his mother's expensive Steuben glass egg. Joel finds Lana and demands the egg back, but they are interrupted by Lana's pimp Guido, who pulls a gun. While in his father's Porsche 928, Joel is chased by Guido, but eventually escapes. Lana tells Joel that the egg is with the rest of her stuff at Guido's. Joel lets Lana stay at his house while he goes to school. When he returns, his friends are over, and Lana has invited another prostitute Vicki to stay, but Joel rejects the idea. That night, Joel, Lana, Vicki, and Joel's friend Barry go out. They get stoned, and while Vicky and Barry wander away, Joel and Lana talk. Lana takes exception to something Joel says and leaves. While retrieving her purse from Joel's car, she moves the shifter out of gear. Moments later, the car rolls down the hill and onto a pier, despite Joel's futile attempt to stop it. The pier collapses, dumping the Porsche into Lake Michigan.  When Joel takes the car to a repair shop, he is horrified to learn how much it will cost to fix it. He and Lana later decide to turn his parents' house into a brothel for a night; Joel's share of the profits will pay for the car repairs. The party is a huge success; the house is packed with Joel's friends and classmates and Lana's co-workers. However, the recruiter from Princeton, Rutherford chooses that night to interview Joel for admission to Princeton. The interview is plagued by interruptions, and Rutherford is unimpressed by Joel's resume. Afterwards, he stays at the party and becomes acquainted with Lana's friends. After the party, Joel and Lana go and have sex on the Chicago ""L"".  The next morning, Joel finds his house has been burgled. When he tries to call Lana, Guido answers; he tells Joel that he will let Joel buy back his furniture. Joel and his friends manage to get everything moved back in just as his parents walk in, though his mother notices a crack in her egg. Later, Joel's father congratulates him; the interviewer was very impressed and has indicated Joel will be accepted into Princeton. Joel meets Lana at a restaurant, and they speculate about their future. She tells him that she wants to keep on seeing him; he jokes that it will cost her.  Alternate ending [ edit ]  The remastered 25th-anniversary edition offers ""both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickman's original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion"".[3]  Cast [ edit ]  Soundtrack [ edit ]  The film was scored by Tangerine Dream. Their music comprises nearly half of the soundtrack album. Also included are songs by Muddy Waters, Prince (""DMSR""), Jeff Beck, Journey, Phil Collins (""In the Air Tonight""), and the song for which the film is best known, ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" by Bob Seger.  The soundtrack album was released on Virgin Records, Tangerine Dream's record company at the time of the film's release.  The film also includes ""Hungry Heart"" by Bruce Springsteen, ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police, and ""Swamp"" by Talking Heads (which includes the words ""risky business"" in the lyrics). The LP and CD versions of the soundtrack include two different versions of ""Love on a Real Train (Risky Business),"" neither of which match the version used in the film for the final love scene or closing credits.  Reception [ edit ]  Risky Business was acclaimed by critics. It is also considered by many as one of the best films of 1983.[4][5][6][7] Janet Maslin, in her 1983 review of the film for The New York Times, called it ""part satire, part would-be suburban poetry and part shameless showing off"" and said the film ""shows an abundance of style"", though ""you would be hard pressed to find a film whose hero's problems are of less concern to the world at large.""[8] She called De Mornay ""disarming as a call girl who looks more like a college girl"" and credits Cruise with making ""Joel's transformation from straight arrow to entrepreneur about as credible as it can be made.""[9]  Roger Ebert was much more positive, calling it a film of ""new faces and inspired insights and genuine laughs"" and ""one of the smartest, funniest, most perceptive satires in a long time"" that ""not only invites comparison with The Graduate, it earns it"".[10]  Ebert continued:[10]  The very best thing about the movie is its dialogue. Paul Brickman, who wrote and directed, has an ear so good that he knows what to leave out. This is one of those movies where a few words or a single line says everything that needs to be said, implies everything that needs to be implied, and gets a laugh. When the hooker tells the kid, ""Oh, Joel, go to school, go learn something,"" the precise inflection of those words defines their relationship for the next three scenes.  Variety said the film was like a ""promising first novel, with all the pros and cons that come with that territory"" and complimented Brickman on ""the stylishness and talent of his direction.""[11] The film holds a 96% ""Certified Fresh"" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.[12]  Legacy [ edit ]  In 2006, the film was #40 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The magazine called the film a ""sharp satire of privileged suburban teens"", portraying the ""soul-crushing pressure to be perfect.""[2][13]  In the years since the film's release, the scene featuring Cruise's character dancing in his pink dress shirt and white briefs to ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" by Bob Seger has been recreated in episodes of many television series, as well as in films, parodies, and advertisements. The song was #100 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs list.",0
"2017 benefit concert organised by Ariana Grande  One Love Manchester was a benefit concert and British television special held on 4 June 2017, which was organised by American singer and actress Ariana Grande in response to the bombing after her concert at Manchester Arena two weeks earlier.[5] The concert took place at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester,[6] and aired live on BBC One in the UK with hosts Sara Cox and Ore Oduba. The concert was attended by 55,000 people. Guest stars included Justin Bieber, the Black Eyed Peas,[7] Coldplay,[6] Miley Cyrus, Marcus Mumford, Niall Horan, Little Mix,[8] Katy Perry, Take That, Imogen Heap, Pharrell Williams, Robbie Williams and Liam Gallagher.[8][9][10]  Proceeds from the event benefit the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, which was established by the Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross[11] following the 22 May bombing, which killed 22 concert goers and injured more than 500. The funds will go to help the victims and their families.[10] The British Red Cross reported it received more than £10 million in donations in the 12 hours following the concert.[12] Despite time zone differences, networks from at least 50 countries broadcast the concert live,[13] which was simultaneously streamed live on various platforms, including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.[14]  New York Magazine's Vulture section ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017.[15]  Background [ edit ]  On 22 May 2017, a suicide bombing was carried out at Manchester Arena in Manchester, England, following a concert by Ariana Grande as part of her Dangerous Woman Tour. 22 of the concert-goers and parents who were in the entrance waiting to pick up their children following the show were killed, more than 500 were injured and 116 of those were seriously injured.  A few hours after the bombing, Grande posted on Twitter: ""broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words. [sic]""[16] The tweet briefly became the most-liked tweet in history.[17] Grande subsequently suspended her tour and flew to her mother's home in Boca Raton, Florida.[18][19] On 26 May, she announced that she would host a benefit concert in Manchester for the victims of the attack.[20]  Before main event [ edit ]  Developments and planning [ edit ]  Promotional poster for the concert  Event tickets were made available on 1 June 2017 for £40, and sold with no booking fees. These tickets sold out within 6 minutes of going on sale.[21] Fans who were at the concert of 22 May could apply to attend at no cost. The application ended on 31 May at 17:00, but was extended till 22:00 to allow as many people at the concert on the 22nd to apply to be there as possible.[5][22] Metrolink offered free travel for concertgoers to and from the Old Trafford tram stop.[23] Uber also said that fares of passengers travelling to and from the concert will be donated to charity.  Following the London attack that occurred a day before the show, Greater Manchester Police announced that security would be tighter than planned. They also advised attendees not to bring bags into the venue for security reasons.[24]  Tickets for the concert were found to be listed for sale on the online auction site eBay, at prices above the original sales price. However, eBay responded by removing these listings from their site.[25]  Main event [ edit ]  A minute's silence was held before Marcus Mumford opened the concert, at the request of Mumford, in memory of those killed both in Manchester and in London.  After Grande's first performance of the night, Stevie Wonder appeared via video link. After Heap's performance, a video of prominent Manchester footballer David Beckham reading a poem dedicated to the city was played. Videos of other artists and celebrities, including Halsey, Bastille, Anne-Marie, Demi Lovato, Jennifer Hudson, Blossoms, Chance the Rapper, Camila Cabello, The Chainsmokers, DJ Khaled, Little Mix, Circa Waves, Kendall Jenner, Clean Bandit, Dua Lipa, Sean Paul, Nick Grimshaw, Kings of Leon, Sam Smith, Rita Ora, Shawn Mendes, Twenty One Pilots, Paul McCartney, U2 and the players of Manchester United and Manchester City declaring their solidarity with Manchester were also shown.  Liam Gallagher made a surprise appearance near the end of the concert. Previously, he had stated he wanted to perform but indicated a conflict with the Rock im Park festival in Germany.[26][27] He flew in straight from his performance in Germany.[28] Coincidentally, he was also scheduled to perform at the Rock am Ring festival two days prior, but the rest of that festival day was cancelled before his scheduled performance due to terror suspicions.[29]  Usher was due to appear but did not perform. He appeared with other musicians in the pre-recorded video sending best wishes to Manchester.[30]  Set list [ edit ]  Broadcast [ edit ]  The concert was broadcast live on BBC One, BBC Radio and Capital FM networks.[9] Television coverage on BBC One was presented by Sara Cox and Ore Oduba, with Nick Grimshaw and Anita Rani hosting from backstage and within the crowd. BBC Radio coverage consisted of a simultaneous broadcast, hosted by Scott Mills, Jo Whiley, Phil Williams and Becky Want, on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio Manchester respectively. BBC World Service also transmitted the concert live.[31]  The BBC also announced that it would broadcast the entire concert, even if it overran its intended three-hour duration,[32] which it did for around 20 minutes.[33]  UK radio stations [ edit ]  The event was broadcast live on at least 65 British radio stations, including 39 Global-based music stations: the entire Capital FM, Heart FM, Gold, Radio X and Smooth Radio networks.  International broadcasters [ edit ]  Broadcasters in at least 38 countries screened the concert live, despite the time zone differences. The BBC was the host broadcaster for international television networks, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) distributed the concert to its radio members, which was also streamed online.[34][35] Radio broadcasters were provided the concert through BBC World Service's program distribution network. Stations that broadcast the concert were invited to make donations through the British Red Cross.[36]  Online streaming [ edit ]  The concert was streamed live online across a number of websites and apps, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.[77]  Attendance and ratings [ edit ]  The 50,000-capacity venue sold out within 20 minutes.[78] Approximately 14,000 people who attended the original Ariana Grande concert were eligible for free tickets for the One Love Manchester concert. However, approximately 10,000 additional applications, from people ineligible for free tickets, caused delays in ticket processing.[79]  The concert averaged 10.9 million viewers on BBC One, peaking at 14.5 million viewers.[78][80] 22.6 million people watched at least three minutes of the programme on BBC One, making it the UK's most-watched television event of 2017.[80] The concert reached an audience share of 49.3 percent in overall viewers, 69 percent of adults 16–24 and 61 percent in the demographic of 25–34 year-olds.[80] Consolidated 7-day figures put the average UK viewership at 11.63 million.[81] BBC iPlayer registered more than one million live-stream requests, making One Love Manchester the biggest non-sports programme in iPlayer’s history, surpassing the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.[82]  Money raised [ edit ]  The British Red Cross received £2.35 million (nearly $3 million) in donations during the three-hour concert for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. By the next day, the British Red Cross announced it had received more than £10 million ($13 million) since the attack,[12] and subsequently, reports have set the total at more than £17 million ($23 million).[83]  Grande also donated all proceeds to the fund from a re-release of her single ""One Last Time"" and a live audio version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" that she performed during the concert.[83]  Ticket sale Original concert ticket holders General ticket holders Total attendance 14,158[84] 50,800[84][85] 55,000[85][86]  Money raised Ticket sale British Red Cross EIF Facebook Fundraising Total amount raised £2 million[ citation needed ] £10 million ($13M)[12] £358.5 thousand ($454.3 thousand)[ citation needed ] £17 million +[83]  Reactions [ edit ]  Francis Wilkinson, in Bloomberg.com, wrote that Grande offered ""a face that was brave and kind in the wake of terror while accomplishing several useful goals – raising money for victims, bolstering courage and making the attacks look both puny and pointless. Whatever the terrorists had hoped to produce in Manchester, it certainly wasn't this party.""[87] She received praise for her ""grace and strength"" in organizing, hosting and performing at the concert.[88][89] Madeline Roth of MTV News wrote that the performance ""bolstered courage among an audience that desperately needed it. ... Returning to the stage was a true act of bravery and resilience"".[90] The City of Manchester named Grande as an honorary citizen of the city following the singer's ""great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit"" and will be the first to be awarded from the city.[91]  Kory Grow in Rolling Stone, wrote ""It felt incredibly safe. As I made my own way to the tram, I wrote in my Apple Notes app, ""Helicopter hovering overhead,"" which to me signified that the fans were being watched over. Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I'd written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they'd read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn't a threat. ""You have to understand, tensions are running high,"" one of the men said with a smile and a handshake, allowing me through the gate. Manchester was secure tonight.""[92] Dee Lockett, in New York Magazine's Vulture section, ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017, noting:  Less than two weeks after the attack, and with only a few days to privately process and mourn, Ariana returned to Manchester with an entire benefit concert she coordinated. ... She called in every favor, pulling in famous friends like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber to show up for the grieving city. After meeting with a parent of one of the victims, Grande said she shifted the tone of the show from somber to celebratory because she understood that it was what her fans needed. ... All night, Ariana performed without breaking, but that was when she had others by her side. ... When it was just her alone with her fans for her finale cover of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", the floodgates opened. In what will likely go down as one of the defining moments of her career, she paused the song, looked out to her audience, which was already sobbing along with her, then resumed the music to nail yet another impossible note.[15]  See also [ edit ]",0

"There have been dozens of dance crazes that have taken over households through the decades. The 1920s saw the jitterbug and the Charleston. The 1960s had the ""Mashed Potato,"" and the twist. And who can forget about the ""Macarena,"" which came to define the 1990s (I still know how to do the dance, move-by-move). This decade also saw its fair share of fad dances: ""Gangham Style,"" the dab, the Harlem Shake, and ""Hit the Quan,"" to name a few. Now you can add a new one to that list: ""Scooby Doo Papa""? I know what you're thinking: What is ""Scooby Doo Papa""? It's an infectious Latin dance track that's become viral thanks to two social media sensations.  New York-based artist DJ Kass released ""Scooby Doo Papa"" back in September, but it didn't catch fire until YouTubers Lele Pons and Inanna Sarkis featured the song in two Instagram videos, according to The Daily Mail. The two social media stars created a dance routine to go along with ""Scooby Doo Papa,"" which they showed off in their first video posted to Instagram back in December. It became an internet sensation in Latin America, and now has finally reached the United States, The Daily Mail reported.  Lele Pons, who has more than 22 million Instagram followers, posted the second video in January (Sarkis has more than seven million Instagram followers). Together, both videos have racked up more than 58 million views, according to E! News.  In both of the videos, the Instagram stars are dressed up as Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley from the original Scooby Doo gang. Pons couldn't keep a straight face in the first video, which shows the duo having fun dancing around in a kitchen. The second video has a bit more production, with a crew of backup dancers supporting Sarkis, who took on the Velma persona.  And their fans are loving ""Scooby Doo Papa."" On the December video, one Instagram user commented on Sarkis' expression, saying ""your face, damn love you so much."" Another wrote, ""Goofy dancing... check.""  The video Pons posted to her Instagram account in January received an equal amount of love from her fans and other social media users alike. One Instagram user wrote, ""This is so funny I can't,"" in all caps. Another called the video ""the funniest."" And others commented on how much they love the song by DJ Kass, who was born in the Dominican Republic.  But Pons and Sarkis aren't the only ones dancing to ""Scooby Doo Papa."" Search YouTube, and you'll find a ton of videos of people moving to DJ Kass's hit song. Mexican television hosts, Peru's National Police Department, and students have all filmed themselves dancing the ""Scooby Doo Papa"" routine, according to The Daily Mail.  As a native New Yorker, it's awesome to see music from a New York-based DJ exploding online. DJ Kass is popular in clubs in the city, particularly in the Bronx, where is based, according to his website. The 26-year-old father comes from a line of DJs; his father was a popular local DJ, too. Now he is making waves across Latin America and the United States.  Back in 2014, DJ Kass wrote on his website about his future plans in music, according to E! News,  For now, I’m currently involved in learning how to produce and create edits. I just want to be heard, appreciated, and known in this world for giving a great show and best of all, entertaining the crowd because I live through them.  ""Scooby Doo Papa"" and the viral response to the song is definitely proof that DJ Kass has achieved his goal as a musician.

"[This story contains spoilers from the series finale of A&E's Bates Motel.]  After five seasons, numerous deaths and a dark decent into madness, the world of A&E's Bates Motel came to a close Monday with an expected yet heartbreaking series finale.  In “The Cord,” the death toll continued to rise. Romero (Nestor Carbonell) fulfilled his death wish when he forced ""Norman"" (Freddie Highmore) to show him where he'd left Norma’s (Vera Farmiga) body. Only Norman — who was still ""Mother"" at that point — killed Romero as he was sobbing over Norma's corpse.  But before Romero breathed his last breath, he reminded Norman of his actions — that he was the one responsible for killing his beloved mother. As a result, “Mother” left Norman behind, saying he no longer needed her now that he knew everything. It was enough to send Norman into a lonely tailspin and revert his damaged mind all the way back to the time of the pilot, when he and Norma first traveled to White Pine Bay and opened their infamous motel.  Hoping against hope for everything to revert back to normal, Norman dragged his mother’s body to the motel and into the house and called his brother Dylan (Max Thieriot) to come over for dinner as though nothing had happened. In the end, Dylan knew that he was the only one left standing who cared about Norman’s well-being and opted not to call the authorities. Instead, Dylan attempted to bring Norman in himself.  Unfortunately, the only thing Norman wanted in the end was to be reunited with his mother, even if it meant he had to die. So in a twisted suicide attempt, Norman rushed at a gun-wielding Dylan with a knife, forcing his brother to shoot and kill him.  “Thank you,” Norman muttered as his last words as Dylan held his dying brother.  To break down the series finale and what went into crafting the ultimate ending, The Hollywood Reporter caught up with co-showrunners Cartlon Cuse and Kerry Ehrin.  How much of this was the ending you planned from the start? How much changed over the years?  Ehrin: We’d always thought of this as a love story. A very weird, warped, dark, love story. In the end, it felt like even if we were reuniting them in death that they had to be reunited. Even if it was lying next to each other in earth for all eternity. That was the driving destination emotionally. The Dylan story became part of that, and him being the one that ushers Norman out of the world felt fitting.  Cuse: We came to the idea later that Dylan would be the one to usher Norman out of the world at Norman’s bequest. But from when we first started talking about the show, we imagined a five-year journey that would end with Norman and Norma both dead. Ultimately, we felt their love story could just not succeed in this world.  Are viewers meant to feel as though Norman wanted Dylan to kill him?  Cuse: He’s coming at Dylan with a knife; I mean, Dylan doesn’t have a choice.  Ehrin: He wants to be put out of his misery at that point. When Norman goes over to the sink and picks up the knife, you can see all these ideas playing in his head of what he’s supposed to do now that he’s been told that Norma is dead; she doesn’t exist, and he’s not going to get her back, and there’s no pretending your way out of this. It’s a beautiful performance, because you see all these things play through him. He doesn’t quite know what he’s doing when he picks up the knife and starts walking toward Dylan. He’s working it out as he’s walking.  Cuse: It’s always a bit of a double-edged sword to talk about stuff afterward. It’s fine for people to have their own interpretation of what happened at the end. Most of the audience will have that experience. It wasn’t intentionally ambiguous, but you can draw your own line and make a decision as to what degree Norman is egging him on and to what degree can Dylan stop himself. There was a certain messy, tragic quality to that final encounter that we love.  Ehrin: Messy tragedy has been our hallmark. We like to not over-define things. We like to throw it out there and wade around it.  Were you going for an Of Mice and Men vibe?  Ehrin: Yes. That’s dead on. That was definitely an inspiration in early discussions. The idea of a mercy killing that was also heartbreaking.  Cuse: There’s a poignancy in Norman having a brief moment of clarity that gives him perspective. If you think of the distorted mental state Norman is in when he invites Dylan to come to dinner and has Norma kind of propped up on the table, there was a real poignancy in having Norman realize that all avenues were closed to him. He doesn’t want to go to a mental institution, he can’t exist in this world, he’s in a degrading mental state. There was no other solution for him.  Why didn’t Emma (Olivia Cooke) call the police when she knew Dylan was going into the house?  Ehrin: She actually did in one draft. It was an editing decision in post. Once you get Dylan into that house, you just wanted to stay with him and be with that and not cut away to something else.  Cuse: It’s fair in a situation like this that characters don’t always do the most logical thing. Obviously, if Emma calls the cops, it really mutes the conclusion that we felt was best for the show, and it felt fair and reasonable that in that moment she defers and doesn’t do it.  Once you introduced Marion Crane (Rihanna), were Norman’s days numbered?  Cuse: There were a couple of guiding principles. We absolutely did not want to end the show in the same way as Psycho. That would have been a profound disappointment and it would deflate the whole intention here, which was to take characters and some of the iconographic imagery from the movie and tell its own story. Our story had its own ending, and so we enjoyed the fun of crossing in and out of the mythology of Psycho at the end. Particularly when we cast Rihanna, we leaned into the fact that the audience would come to it with these very specific expectations based on the movie, and we wanted to flip their expectations on their ear. That was fun to do, but as far as the ending goes, we were never judging it against the ending in Psycho or felt an obligation to connect it to the ending of Psycho. Our obligation at the end was to hopefully have this tragic love story come to a satisfying ending. Sad can be satisfying. We knew it wouldn’t be happy, but we hoped it would be satisfying.  Psycho aside, was there any point where you second-guessed your decision to kill Norman?  Ehrin: No. Certainly a part of you wants to somehow have everything turn out OK just because you love the characters. But this is closer to Wuthering Heights than Harvey. There’s an ending where Norman just walks off into the hills talking to his mother and the sun goes down and everyone’s happy. In my head, that kind of exists, but that wasn’t what we were delivering.  When Norma leaves Norman following Romero’s death, does that close the door on his mental defense case in these murders?  Ehrin: Yes, because he’s alone. He doesn’t have that buffer anymore, and he can’t deal with it. It pushes him over the edge, and it leads him on this journey to recall the past and kind of redo it.  How did you come up with the idea to reincorporate the pilot into the episode?  Cuse: One of the things that’s always satisfying in finales is to remind audiences of the journey they’ve been on. There’s a resonance in rewarding an audience that has watched all 50 episodes of our show with a sense of that journey. Some of it arose from those feelings. It was also a way to make the love story feel epic. The thing that makes something epic is its existence across a large spread of time. We wanted to reconnect the audience to the fact that this love story and relationship was a lifelong journey.  When did you decide that Dylan, Emma and their daughter would live in the sun?  Ehrin: That instinct first came at the end of the second season.  Cuse: We realized the show was heading in a very dark direction, and we felt it was important to have some ray of hope at the end of our narrative. It became clear that early that Dylan and Emma deserved to come out of this with a relatively happy ending.  Ehrin: There was something really interesting toward the end of the second season to have these two people who were both really outside of the Norma-Norman island and couldn’t get on it, that they would find each other and miraculously make their own world together. It made us happy to think about, and it became something that was fun to work toward in the writing. You do try to balance it — even on a purely selfish level for your own self. When you’re living inside of this stuff, it’s very dark, and it’s nice to have strands of hope to hold onto. That played out even in writing Norma and Norman, because you would constantly have to put yourself in denial about the ending. You wanted to always infuse them with hope that things would be better. That they were going to work out of it. It’s an interesting process to write that. It’s very emotionally and physically taxing…it's bizarre.  Was there any talk of having that last shot be the daughter giving the camera a creepy Norman Bates-type smile, rather than ending it on a happier note?  Cuse: That will be the sequel.  Ehrin: We joked about that in the writers' room, that she would be like Baby Norma, but that she would be evil. But no. The kid is good, and Dylan and Emma are good.

"Australian actress and film producer  Margot Elise Robbie ( MAR-goh ROB-ee; born 2 July 1990)[1][2][3] is an Australian actress and film producer. In 2017, Time magazine named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world and Forbes featured her in their 30 Under 30 list.[4][5]  Born and raised on a farm in Dalby, Queensland, Robbie studied drama at Somerset College. She began her career in Australian independent films in the late 2000s, before working in the soap opera Neighbours (2008–2011), which earned her two Logie Award nominations. After moving to the United States, she starred in the short-lived ABC drama series Pan Am (2011–2012). In 2013, she had a supporting role in the romantic comedy About Time, and made her breakthrough later that year by co-starring in Martin Scorsese's biographical black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street.  Robbie launched a production company named LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014. Her profile continued to grow with leading roles in the romantic drama Focus (2015), as Jane Porter Clayton in the action-adventure film The Legend of Tarzan (2016), and as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the superhero film Suicide Squad (2016). Robbie received critical acclaim in 2017 for her portrayal of the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding in the biographical film I, Tonya, which she also produced, receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote ""Robbie is a wow and then some. The Aussie actress who made us sit up and take notice as Leonardo DiCaprio's wife in The Wolf of Wall Street shows a comic flair backed up with beauty and steel. Even when Focus fumbles, Robbie deals a winning hand.""[41] Focus grossed over $150 million worldwide.[42][43] In 2015, Robbie received a nomination for the BAFTA Rising Star Award.[44] Also in 2015, Robbie played the leading role of Ann Burden in the film adaptation of Z for Zachariah with Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor, which was shot in New Zealand.[45][46] The film premiered on 24 January 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival [47] and had its theatrical release on 28 August 2015, receiving positive reviews.[48][49] Robbie's performance was praised by critics.

"So it seems that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have finally decided to go public with their romance which the two have managed to keep under wraps for years now. The ongoing denials by each star certainly had the masses scratching their heads seeing as the duo were often seen in one another’s company on getaways and at various locales in Los Angeles.  Reasons for Katie and Jamie not going public earlier are rumored to be due to a contract that was signed by Holmes during her swift divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Tom Cruise. The contract was said to have included a five-year dating clause which meant that the Dawson’s Creek star was not allowed to date publicly for this duration. Well, that was back in 2012, so the five years are up, which leads onlookers to believe that the contract was a real binding agreement.  Additional claims, since Jamie and Katie were spotted walking in Malibu holding hands, have been made regarding Cruise’s reaction to his ex and former co-star coming clean about their relationship. The action star is reportedly “furious” and “envious” about the relationship between Holmes and Foxx and feels a sense of betrayal over it all, as International Business Times states.  A said source indicates that Tom is bothered by the romance and that “Katie is so happy with someone else,” adding that “Tom would love to find his own true love, someone he can share the rest of his life with too. ”  ‘Katie Holmes finally goes public with new man Jamie Foxx, I’m questioning why she ever agreed to marry Tom Cruise’https://t.co/NWx1Ogo3ml — The Sun (@TheSun) September 10, 2017  It’s been no secret that Cruise’s relationship with the Church of Scientology has caused both of his marriages to fail and if the star is to find love again, it must be with the approval of the faith. As for Tom being “furious,” this seems a bit far-fetched seeing as the actor was snapped looking as happy as can be, even after news broke that Katie and Jamie are, in fact, an item.  Tom Cruise is pictured for the first time since ex-wife Katie Holmes confirmed her relationship with Jamie Foxx https://t.co/BqKD4cDrxm — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 6, 2017  As The Sun indicated, Cruise recently landed in London and fans awaiting the Hollywood heartthrob were greeted with an ear-to-ear smile from Tom, who also gave an enthusiastic thumbs up. The actor had recently been injured while filming the latest installment for the Mission Impossible franchise, yet looked much better and entirely unaffected by the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reveal.

"NATIONAL ROSÉ DAY  National Rosé Day is observed annually on the second Saturday in June. Rosé is probably the oldest known type of wine, dating back as far as 600 BC. Rosé wines are generally made from red grapes and are very versatile wines that complement many types of food. Rosé is lighter than red wine and deeper than white wine. The pink color of rosé wine depends on the time the grape skin stays in contact with the juice, also known as maceration. There are rosé wines that are semi-sparkling or sparkling, with different intensities of sweetness levels and dryness.  HOW TO OBSERVE  Celebrate National Rosé Day by having a bottle of Rosé wine with dinner or simply invite friends over for h’orderves and enjoy each other’s company. Share your special evening on Social Media on Facebook@NationalRoséDay and Instagram@nationalroseday using #NationalRoséDay.

"© Paul Drinkwater/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Daniel-Tosh Now here’s some funny business! According to a new report, comedian Daniel Tosh secretly married Carly Hallam — a writer on his Comedy Central show, Tosh.0 — more than two years ago.  Tosh, 43, and Hallam, 31, tied the knot on April 15, 2016, at a hush-hush ceremony in Malibu, California, TMZ reports. Details of the relationship are scarce, but Hallam has been writing for Tosh.0 since 2012. She has also appeared onscreen in nine episodes of the show, which features viral videos, original skits, and social commentary. It’s currently airing its 10th season.  Hallam has also written for Brooklyn Nine-Nine since 2016. The comedy was dropped by FOX last month but was picked up for a sixth season by NBC.  Tosh and Hallam are both on social media, but neither seems to have addressed their relationship online.

"If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband.",1

"When Justin Timberlake takes the stage at Super Bowl LII for the halftime show Sunday at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, there is at least one famous name who thinks he needs to make reparations.  “If he’s such a gentleman, he’d make sure Janet [Jackson] is there,” Joseph Jackson told The Post.  The singer’s father is not the only one who thinks that Timberlake should make amends for Nipplegate — the infamous 2004 Super Bowl scandal that bruised Jackson’s career and her ego, after a planned stunt turned into a costume malfunction, leaving her bare breast exposed to 140 million viewers.  Since it was announced that Timberlake would be performing at this year’s big game, Twitter has been alight with the #JusticeForJanet hashtag, as users call out the privilege suggested by Timberlake being asked to perform again, while Jackson was not.  Timberlake has stayed mum about including Jackson in his halftime show, although he recently told Beats 1 host Zane Lowe that the two had “absolutely” made peace.  But Jackson family insiders say that just because the singer has forgiven Timberlake for not standing up for her when she was vilified for the incident, she hasn’t forgotten.  “Justin’s solo career took off after that and Janet was blackballed,” one family member said. “He says they are good, but let’s see him prove it and bring her out.”  ‘Justin’s solo career took off after that and Janet was blackballed’  So what really happened in 2004 at Reliant Stadium (now NRG Stadium) in Houston? Conspiracy theories abound that the wardrobe “malfunction” was secretly planned by Jackson and Timberlake, but Jackson sources say that’s not the case.  They admit, however, that there was great mystery in the run-up to that halftime show.  “When some of us went to Houston, we were told they were doing rehearsals,” said a relative. “People from the NFL and MTV were there so [we] thought we would get a preview of the performance.”  Instead, security advised that final rehearsals were closed to everyone.  “We had heard that they were experimenting on some sort of elaborate production,” the relative added.  It’s easy to forget that Jackson and Timberlake were not the only acts that night. Produced by MTV — who had previously organized the 2001 halftime event — the show first featured performances by Jessica Simpson, Diddy, Nelly and Kid Rock. Jackson took the stage with a marching band for her 1989 hit “Rhythm Nation,” then was joined by Timberlake for his “Rock Your Body.”  The two had a sexy, playful chemistry and had previously been rumored to have been hooking up. Jackson was in the early throes of a romance with producer Jermaine Dupri, but “everyone — including [her mother] Katherine knew the chemistry was there,” a Jackson insider said.  You could practically feel the heat as the two gyrated against each other onstage. At the end of the number, while singing “I’m gonna have you naked by the end of this song,” Timberlake reached across Jackson’s chest, grabbing her right breast and ripping off part of her top — exposing her bare breast, the nipple completely covered by a large silver sun attached by a piercing.  Looking back at video of the incident, it’s hard to make out Jackson’s expression immediately after, as her face was mostly obscured by her hair, but she quickly covered herself with her hand. In photos from the event, Timberlake looks shell-shocked.  Jackson later explained to her mother that the cups of her top had been attached with a Velcro-like fabric that could easily be manipulated or opened to reveal a red lace bra underneath, according to the family source.  The source confirmed that Jackson and Timberlake had hatched a plan for him to rip off the top’s cup, but didn’t alert MTV, CBS, the NFL or even their backup dancers.  “They were like, let’s make this real and show the meaning behind [the song],” the Jackson insider said.  “Her red bra was all that was supposed to show, no nipple, no exposure,” the insider said. “It was meant to be a little racy, but nobody meant for her breast to show. It became a big deal because Justin grabbed the costume much too hard and, instead of pulling the one small part, he tore the bra part, too.” (Representatives for Timberlake did not return calls for comment.)  Behind the scenes, there was confusion, as MTV executive producer Salli Frattini, recalled to ESPN The Magazine in 2014: “There was lots of chaos in the [production truck, and we played it back and we were like, ‘Oh, s – – t. What just happened?’ ”  At first, Jackson — who flew out of Houston that night — had no idea just how big the fallout would be. “At that point, she was just a little upset — a little troubled that her breast was seen in front of the biggest audience in history,” the family member recalled.  But when she exited the stage, no one — including reps from AOL and the NFL, as well as Nelly — would look at her.  “No one said anything when she left the stage,” the family member added. “It was like, ‘Uh-oh, we’ve got trouble.’”  Before the game was over and the Patriots had beaten the Panthers, 32-29, Jackson’s representative had issued the first statement, explaining that Timberlake was supposed to have pulled off the bustier cup only, not the bra itself.  The NFL responded quickly to the incident, making clear it was “disappointed.” The league’s then executive vice president, Joe Browne, said “it’s unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.” (Indeed, the network has not.)  MTV released a statement claiming that “the tearing of Janet Jackson’s costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance.” The network’s then CEO, Tom Freston, alleged that Jackson alone had “engineered” the stunt.  Over the next week, some 200,000 viewers reportedly complained to the FCC, which later fined CBS $550,000; the decision was tied up in the court system for eight years before finally being tossed out in favor of CBS.  AOL, which had sponsored the halftime event, asked for a refund on its $10 million investment. Advertiser McDonald’s called the incident “inappropriate” — but did not drop Timberlake as its “I’m lovin’ it” spokesman.  At first, Timberlake was flippant about Nipplegate, telling Access Hollywood that, “We love giving you all something to talk about.” But he changed his tune shortly after that, saying, “I’m sorry if anyone was offended.”  Jackson meanwhile, issued both written and taped statements, absolving MTV, CBS and the NFL and saying, “It was not my intention that it go as far as it did.”  But the damage was already done.  The weekend after the Super Bowl, Timberlake and Jackson had been scheduled to appear at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards on CBS, where both were slated to perform. Timberlake’s performance happened. Jackson, who was supposed to lead a tribute to Luther Vandross, was allegedly uninvited.  Her punishment didn’t end there.  When Jackson’s “Damita Jo” album came out two months after the 2004 Super Bowl, she was facing a mountain of obstacles. As Rolling Stone reported, Viacom — the parent company then of both CBS and MTV — [hit] back . . . by essentially blacklisting her, keeping her music videos off their properties MTV, VH1 and radio stations under their umbrella. The blacklist [spread] to include non-Viacom media entities as well.”  Jackson told relatives that she was embarrassed and feared she’d never perform again.  “Radio stations wouldn’t play her music. Her album, which was great, suffered,” the family member recalled. Billboard reported that “Damita Jo” was her worst-selling album over a 20-year span, despite receiving largely favorable reviews.  So devastating was the backlash, Jackson stopped attending family gatherings and shut out those closest to her. “She’d drive by [the family’s Encino estate] in her bright yellow Jeep. We’d see her but she’d keep going,” a second relative said. “It was like she didn’t know what to do.”  Loved ones and friends, including filmmaker Tyler Perry, became concerned about Jackson’s health.  ‘MTV ought to be ashamed, my family helped build MTV . . . and this is the thanks we get.’ - Jermaine Jackson  “She’s going into depression, she’s not herself,” her brother Jermaine said at the time. “Justin needs to hold a press conference and condemn CBS, MTV and everyone else for what they’re doing to Janet. MTV ought to be ashamed, my family helped build MTV . . . and this is the thanks we get.”  It took two years before Timberlake would tell MTV News: “If you consider it 50-50, then I probably got 10 percent of the blame. I think America is harsher on women. I think America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people.”  Not long after that, Jackson admitted to Oprah Winfrey that while Timberlake had reached out to her, she wasn’t ready to reply.  “Friendship is very important to me, and certain things you just don’t do to friends,” she said. “In my own time, I’ll give him a call.”  When Winfrey asked if Timberlake had “left [her] out there hanging,” Jackson replied, “To a certain degree.” She added that all the blame had been put on “me, as opposed to us.”  On Saturday, Jackson issued a statement saying there would be no halftime reunion.  “To put to rest any speculation or rumors as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow, I will not,” she said.  To this day, Jackson’s Waterloo has shaped the culture in unexpected ways.  As a result of the incident, the FCC instituted a five-second tape delay on Super Bowl performances, allowing censors time to catch offensive material.  see also How Super Bowl is protecting itself from Nipplegate sequel Timberlake will perform Sunday at Super Bowl LII's halftime show...  Coincidentally or not, no women appeared again at the halftime show until 2011 when the Black Eyed Peas — including Fergie — took the stage.  Most remarkably, we have Nipplegate to thank for YouTube. Co-founder Jawed Karim told USA Today that he was inspired to create the video site in 2005 after not being able to find any footage of the incident online.  Some who condemned Jackson have finally admitted it was too much.  In 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell told ESPN the Magazine that the committee had acted “unfairly” toward the singer. “It all turned into being about her,” Powell said. “In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate.”  As for Timberlake, he recently said that he “stumbled through” his handling of the situation. Jackson family insiders reveal he had to ask a few times before Jackson finally agreed to quietly meet up with him a few years ago in Los Angeles. After talking for a while, the two patched up their differences and sealed their friendship with a kiss and a long embrace.  That said, however, the Jackson insider explained that, “Publicly, Janet will tell everyone she’s forgiven Justin, but privately, she’s reluctant to trust him. He’s reached out to her about doing some things together but I don’t think she’s ready for that. Is she still angry? No. She doesn’t wish him any ill will. Does she still think about it? Not all of the time, but certainly since he’s doing the halftime show again, it’s definitely been a dinner table topic.”  The insider said that more than anything, Jackson is disappointed. “[Timberlake] used to dig her but when it came to supporting her after what happened, he disappeared. That’s not too manly and she didn’t deserve that. Even if she’s chosen to forgive him, it doesn’t mean she’s gotten past how he didn’t man up.  “We believe [the Super Bowl is a chance for him to] show her . . . and the world that he was wrong. He should insist that she come out and do something even if it’s just him apologizing publicly in front of the whole stadium. It’s not too late.”",0
"Can Kimye last long-term if Kanye’s besties, Jay-Z and Beyonce, keep giving her the cold shoulder? Or can friends “kill” a love affair?  On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate. There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.  Diana Falzone  More Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Feud",0

"The Material Girl, who has drawn the ire of the Vatican over the years, is eyeing luxury properties in two of the city's neighborhoods, according to reports.  ROME – Reportedly tiring of life in London and New York, the Material Girl is said it be mulling a move to the Eternal City.  The Italian media reported Wednesday that Madonna may be looking to acquire a luxury property in Rome.  The most likely candidates: a luxury villa on the Aventine Hill, or a penthouse apartment in the iconoclastic neighborhood designed by early 20th century architect Gino Coppede. There is no official word from the camp of the singer born as Madonna Louise Ciccone about a possible move, though the 54-year-old pop icon has always maintained close ties with Italy, the home of her ancestors.  Madonna’s personal donation of $500,000 to help the victims of the devastating 2009 earthquake in Abruzzo was at first larger than the aid from the U.S. government. She has also opined periodically on Italian affairs, and has been a vocal critic of media tycoon and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  VIDEO: Madonna Turns 54: Her Top 5 Hits  Madonna’s directorial effort, W.E., which told the story of the love story between British King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year.  But she has also been attacked repeatedly by the Vatican, which called the video for her 1989 hit ""Like a Prayer"" ""blasphemous"" for its visions of burning crosses, statues that cried blood and a scene where Madonna herself seduced a black actor playing Jesus Christ. In 2004, she was also criticized for promoting the Kabbalah religious belief, which the Vatican considers to be a threat to Roman Catholicism.  Most recently, church officials blasted her for the decision to sing while hanging from a crucifix during a 2006 concert in Rome. After that show, Cardinal Ersilio Tonino, speaking for Pope Benedict XVI, said, ""This time the limits have really been pushed too far. She should be excommunicated.""  She last attracted headlines in Italy in June, when during another concert in Rome, Madonna flashed her buttocks, revealing her black undergarments and fishnet stockings, to the delight of concertgoers.  Rome has been a popular destination for the entertainment world’s elite since the Dolce Vita days of the 1950s and 1960s. But in recent years, few top stars have gone as far as to move there.",0
"The US mag story everyone is talking about Star magazine  According to a cover story in US magazine Star today, Jen has allegedly been ""caught out"" planning a get together at the posh US ski destination with her ex Brad, amid the collapse of his marriage and published claims that her own union to actor Justin Theroux is supposedly on thin ice.  ‘They’ve been growing closer ever since Jen reached out to Brad after his split from Ange,’ a source told Star. ‘Jen has been a real source of comfort and strength for Brad, and during their long talks, they realised just how strong their bond still is.’  The publication goes on to claim that the duo have arranged to meet up on a skiing break. While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.  ‘When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year’s, a light bulb went off in Brad’s head,’ claims Star’s source. ‘He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.  ‘He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets.

The magazine claims that Jen has booked a $10,000 a night chalet featuring multiple fireplaces and hot tubs.  ‘The trip is going to be a blast,’ claims the source, who adds, ‘I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.’  Reps for both Brad and Jen have denied Star’s story, and Jen has long said how happy she is with husband Justin.",0
"Selma Blair has returned former co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar’s compliment by admitting their onscreen smooch ranks as her favourite.

When asked about the celluloid moment by TMZ, Selma said: ‘She’s always my favourite kiss; I love Sarah.'  Scroll down for video  All time favourite: Selma Blair has returned Sarah Michelle Gellar's compliment by admitting their intimate moment in 1999 film Cruel Intentions is her favourite onscreen kiss  With tongue firmly in cheek she added: 'We’re still practicing – every weekend.’  The 42-year-old actress was asked for her stance on the kiss after former Buffy star Sarah, 37, addressed the scene during a US radio interview in October.

"DUN DUN DUN. “Oh baby, baby ... ”. In just three seconds ...Baby One More Time, which turns 20 this year, announced the arrival of a new superstar: the then 16-year-old ex-Mouseketeer from Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney Jean Spears. Along with its equally iconic high school-set music video it re-turfed pop, kickstarting an entire sound (think funk-tinged R&B grooves mixed with Abba melodies), sweeping aside the dregs of grunge (sorry, Bush) and US heartland rock (bye, Hootie & the Blowfish), revitalising pop radio and MTV in the process, before cementing its songwriter and co-producer Max Martin as one of modern music’s most influential exponents. In the space of just three minutes and 31 seconds, Spears launched millennial teen pop, fusing family-friendly, girl-next-door fun with good old fashioned controversy, forging a template for those who followed.  Without it, there would by no Christina Aguilera, no Katy Perry, no Charli XCX; Taylor Swift would probably still be singing country songs, and Eminem – who arrived in 1999 – would not have had as much to rail against. Released in the wake of Alanis Morissette’s hugely successful 1995 album Jagged Little Pill and its litany of imitators, it presented a different angle to the prevalent idea of female angst; this was gloriously OTT teen girl longing, encapsulated by a lyric – “My loneliness is killing me” – that feels depressingly evergreen. “The whole song is about that stress that we all go through as teens,” Spears tells me. “I knew it was a great song. It was different and I loved it, [but] I don’t think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received.”  In a Sliding Doors-esque moment that could have changed the world as we know it, …Baby One More Time very nearly didn’t get written at all, with the song’s melody bubbling up as Martin was drifting off to sleep. Having hauled himself out of bed to his nearby dictaphone, he sketched out the song. “I remember listening back to [the tape] after [the song] blew up and you can hear me sort of go: ‘Hit me baby one more time’, then I hear myself say, Yeah, it’s pretty good,’” the notoriously interview-shy Martin told Swedish journalist Jan Gradvall in 2016. Martin, convinced he’d written an R&B song (“Pop music with a flavour – what we call R&B in Sweden, what you guys [in America] say is pop,” he said in 1998), sent the song, then called Hit Me Baby (One More Time), to TLC who rejected it. “I was like: ‘I like the song but do I think it’s a hit? Do I think it’s TLC?’ … Was I going to say ‘Hit me baby one more time’? Hell no!” said T-Boz in 2013.  While TLC interpreted the lyrics as alluding to domestic violence, they actually represented Martin’s attempts at American slang, believing “hit me” could seamlessly replace “call me”. The song was then offered to fellow Swede, Robyn, whom Martin had already worked with on two US top 10 singles (Do You Know (What It Takes) and Show Me Love, both released in 1997), but again nothing came of it. According to Tim Bower’s 2012 book, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, the song had one further dalliance with a pop act other than Britney. The story goes that after hearing Martin’s demo of what had now been renamed …Baby One More Time, Cowell demanded he have the song for his latest boyband, UK rabble Five. Martin had already co-written Five’s debut single, Slam Dunk (Da Funk) alongside his mentor, the late Denniz Pop, but declined Cowell’s request, saying it had already been earmarked for Spears. “You’re mad,” Cowell is reported to have said. “No one can be successful with a name like that.” As a last gasp attempt, Cowell offered Martin a new Merc 500SL in return for the song. “It costs £95,000,” he added.  It was …Baby One More Time that convinced Spears of the merits of pop. She initially saw herself as making “Sheryl Crow music, but younger”, while Larry Rudolph, an entertainment lawyer friend of Spears’s mum Lynne who had been tasked with getting her signed (he’s now her manager), had her record a clutch of songs originally recorded by Toni Braxton. It was those recordings that lead to auditions for Mercury, Epic and Jive (the first two labels said no; she signed with the latter) which included Spears covering Whitney Houston’s version of I Will Always Love You. With the more R&B-leaning early material not working, and with a clause allowing Jive to terminate her contract after 90 days if they felt an album wasn’t on the horizon, A&R Steve Lunt approached Martin, who had already delivered success for Jive’s boyband the Backstreet Boys. A meeting was set up with Spears in New York. “I was pretty young at the time, so I was nervous,” she says, “but he was so nice and put me right at ease.” For Martin, his song had finally found its home.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Maxed out: Spears and Martin, 2017. Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage  From New York, Spears de-camped to Martin’s Cheiron studios in Stockholm to start recording. “I remember being so in awe of Stockholm,” Spears says. “I was out there for, like, 10 days, but we were so busy in the studio I didn’t have time to go out and explore on that first trip.” The song’s co-producer Rami Yacoub remembers Spears as “very shy and super sweet – I mean she was a kid and we had no idea there was a beast of an artist lurking under that innocent look”. The sessions were intense, with four of the album’s five singles recorded in that time. In 2001, Martin referred to the Cheiron sound as “direct, effective, we don’t show off”, words reiterated by Yacoub. “A song that sounds simple is not simple to make. It’s all about the taste and making sure you don’t add more than what the song needs.”  For Spears, working with perfectionists suited her. “I really respect that when I’m working with him,” she says. “I think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.”  Another person to witness firsthand this studied effortlessness was Nana Hedin, a backing vocalist who had previously worked with Denniz Pop on songs by Dr Alban, whose 1992 hit It’s My Life soundtracked a Tampax advert in the UK. Pop recommended Hedin to Martin, who brought her onboard for …Baby One More Time. “I remember I thought the song was for teenagers but the production was filled with a grown-up attitude and sounds that I really liked,” she says. “I was so impressed by how a guy like Max could write lyrics that got into the hearts and spoke to the teenage thinking.” Occasionally, Hedin would record her backing vocals first, before the artist arrived, but with …Baby One More Time Spears’s vocals were already recorded. “I tried to sound exactly like her,” she laughs. “It was hard, but a lot of fun. I’m like a parrot in many ways. I try to get the same vibe and use the exact same pronunciation as the artist. In one harmony, each take is different; I sing very high, in another I use powerful belting, the next I’m whispering and sometimes I even pinch my nose for a sharper sound.”  With Britney’s vocals recorded in March, and the song finished shortly after (“It took probably around two to three weeks to finish,” says Yacoub), Spears headed out on a summer tour, taking in 26 shopping malls. Aware that they had a potential hit on their hands, Jive sent reps out to meet with the influential US radio programme directors ahead of the song’s October release. “The label guy brought in a video featuring Britney rehearsing dance moves to the song,” remembers Clarke Ingram, then operations manager and program director of New York’s Top 40 radio station WPXY. “This had the desired effect of showing me that Britney had star quality, in addition to having a potential hit record. We went to lunch afterwards, and I committed to adding the song at that time.” In fact, Ingram is pretty sure he was the first person to play the song on US radio. “No other station would have heard it any earlier, and I know of no station that played it before we did.” For Ingram, …Baby One More Time represented the holy grail: a song pop radio could fully own. “We’d been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-90s, and something of an R&B cycle after that,” he explains. “Britney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. The song hit the centre of the Top 40 audience, and it proved that by its performance, both on the air and off.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest She’s so lucky: Britney in 1999. Photograph: ACTION PRESS/REX/Shutterstock  The song sold 500,000 copies on its first day of release in the US, eventually peaking at No 1. It reached No 1 in every single country it charted in, and was 1999’s biggest-selling song in the UK with 1.4m copies sold. A megastar had been created seemingly overnight. “I don’t think we understood what we had done,” Martin said in a 2008 Swedish radio documentary. “I remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No 1 in the USA … I had so much going on I didn’t really grasp the meaning of it”. He even forgot to tell Yacoub. “Max walked into the studio one day while I was working and said: ‘Hey man, by the way, we are No 1 in America,’” he recalls. “I asked him when it had happened and he said: ‘Three weeks ago.’ We really didn’t focus on charts, we just kept working.” Even celebrations were muted. “It was on a Tuesday, I believe: an early dinner, a cigar, and to bed at 11pm as we had work the next day.”  An iconic song needed an iconic video. Unfortunately, director Nigel Dick’s original concept was deemed a dud by Spears. “I wrote an idea which sucked, so the label put me back on the phone with Britney who told me she wanted to make a video where she was stuck in a classroom thinking about boys and we took it from there,” Dick writes on the harangued-sounding FAQ section of his website. He also states the school uniform look, augmented by plaited bunches and bare midriff, was Spears’s idea too. What seems relatively tame now caused uproar in a bubblegum pop era that, via shows like MTV’s popular Total Request Live, was being fed directly into family homes.  The video, an instant pop culture moment that gave Spears all-important tabloid notoriety, also fused in the public consciousness with David LaChapelle’s controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot featuring Spears lying on her childhood bed in her underwear clutching a Teletubby. Suddenly, the now turbo-charged teen pop genre had its flag bearer, one whose identity – sweet southern belle in the video for soft-focus follow-up single Sometimes; red PVC-clad dominatrix in the “not that innocent” Oops!…I Did It Again visual – was malleable enough to, at least initially, be everything all at once. How does Spears feel about the song almost 20 years later? “Wow, that went quick. It was such a fun and crazy time, it was a bit of a blur.”  Britney Spears plays Open Air Theatre, Scarborough, Friday 17 August; touring to 1 September",1
"She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release.  And Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night.  The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida.  Baggy dress: Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night  The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset.  The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do.  The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels.  Stepping out: The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida  Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish.  The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance.  The artist explained on Thursday why she was staying silent, telling people that they should listen to her upcoming album if they want to discover things she'd rather rap about than talk about, during an interview on Apple Music out Thursday.  Striking: The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset  Blonde ambition: The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do  Sharp: Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish  Sole survivor: The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels  Keeping mum: The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance  Hot right now: She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release  Speaking to Ebro Darden, the starlet said: 'I feel like people just got to tune in a little bit on my album and they will know a little bit more because I can't address all the rumors and everything.  'I have been so open to people about myself. People cannot expect me to be open about everything. Certain things to me, it has to be private. You cannot invade my privacy,' said B ahead of her Friday album release.  Cardi - who became engaged to Offset in October last year - blasted the idea that she should be open like an 'animal in the zoo', and hinted that people would only know if she was pregnant 'if it [the baby] arrives'.  Speaking during an interview for Beats 1 Radio, Cardi said: 'I'm not a damn animal at the zoo that you just could see everything, no. People will just find out more. If it arrives, if it don't arrive, then you gonna know what the f**k is going on.'  At the beginning of December, 2017, Cardi B said that she and Offset plan to spend $1 million on their wedding.  Loved up: One member Offset is also engaged to rapper Cardi B who happens to be the hottest up-and-comer in hip-hop, as the couple are pictured together in February  'We're going to spend over a million,' she told BBC Radio One’s Charlie Sloth.  The pregnancy rumors come after Offset's iCloud was hacked and photos and footage was leaked of him with another girl.  Cardi forgave her beau for the gaffe, and said she doesn't owe an explanation to those who wonder why she didn't leave the star.  She said: 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck like, ""Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem.""  'I don't have low self-esteem ... I know I look good. I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented. I know I could get any man I want - any basketball player, football player.  'But I want to work out my s**t with my man, and I don't got to explain why. I'm not your property. This is my life... I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision...  'It's not right, what he f***ing did, but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.'  While Cardi was willing to forgive the Motorsport rapper (seen in her Bartier Crdi video above) for his indiscretion, she was less understanding about people's unsolicited advice, saying 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck'  Last year, she signed a record deal with Atlantic Records, whose other artists include Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran.  Cardi B’s ‘Bodak Yellow’ topped Billboard 100 for three consecutive weeks and her boyfriend, Migos’ Offset, became her fiancé when he proposed to her in October.  Her first music appearance was in November 2015, on Shaggy’s ‘Boom Boom’ remix single.  Following two mixtapes, Gangsta B*tch Music, Vol. 1 and Gangsta B*tch, Vol. 2, the rapper signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in February, 2017.  In May of the same year, Cardi B was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the 2017 BET Awards.  In January 2018, Cardi B surpassed Beyonce as the first female artist to have five Top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in the same week.  She is also featured on Bruno Mars’s ‘Finesse (Remix)’ and appeared in the accompanying 90s video.",1
"Joe Alwyn is finally letting fans in on his daily life — but don’t expect any cuddly selfies with girlfriend Taylor Swift just yet.  Alwyn made his Instagram public over the weekend, simultaneously revealing a past, sly reference to Swift.  On May 8, Swift, 28, posted a picture of herself in front of a huge cactus. Swift — who wore a long black dress and shades for the occasion — wrote, “Fact: I’ve never been more excited about a tour than I am about this one. And it starts TOMORROW. Also, not even remotely tour related, but today I met a cactus.”  As it turns out, Alwyn, 27, posted a picture of the same cactus on the same day, captioning his snapshot with only the corresponding emoji. In his picture, he also stood solo, wearing a grey shirt, black shorts, a cap, and sandals.  Swift kicked off her Reputation tour in Glendale, Arizona, the next day. During the show, the singer seemingly pointed at Alwyn, who was seen in the crowd, as she belted out “Gorgeous.”  WATCH: Taylor Swift’s Friends Think Joe Alwyn Could Be “The One”  RELATED: Ultimate Cat Lady Taylor Swift Pokes Fun at Her Beloved Felines on International Cat Day  Alwyn has since posted a picture from the set of his upcoming film The Favourite with Nicholas Hoult, Emma Stone, and others.

In July, the couple jetted off to Turks and Caicos, where they splashed and snorkeled in the ocean and held hands on the beach.

"Did Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton walk down the aisle in secret? A source close to Gwen told HL EXCLUSIVELY the reason why they call each other ‘husband & wife’!  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton had fans thinking they might have gotten married after Gwen posed for a picture with her brother Todd’s wife Jen on Jul. 29 during the couple’s Florida vacation. However, fans mistook Jen for Blake’s sister Endy, and since Gwen called Jen her “sister-in-law” in the caption, some people (believing Jen to Endy) wrongly believed that this was a cryptic clue that maybe, just maybe Gwen and Blake got married. On top of that, a source close to Gwen confirmed to us EXCLUSIVELY that the two have not gotten hitched. “Gwen and Blake haven’t gotten secretly married, but they’re always joking around and calling each other husband and wife,” our source said. “Gwen and Blake have spoken about getting married, and it’s something that they definitely do want to do one day, but they’re really happy with the way things are right now, and they’ve both been married before so they don’t see the point of rushing things.”  When it comes down to it, Gwen and Blake have a great thing going on — the two were photographed on July 1 in a LA convenience store looking like a perfect modern family along with Gwen’s kids — so why would they mess with that? “Neither Gwen or Blake want to jinx what they have,” our source added. “It’s so perfect as it is, and they’re aware that sometimes getting married can add an extra pressure to a relationship, and they don’t want to risk that right now. Plus, their schedules are so busy, that logistically it would be kind of a headache trying to arrange a wedding, so they’d rather wait till Gwen’s residency is over and take their time so they can do it properly and plan something really beautiful and special, when the time is right.”  And beyond that, they don’t want to rush into marriage. If anything, they want to make sure everything goes perfectly with their wedding when the time comes. “They want to take their time and do things properly,” our source continued. “They want to make sure their love lasts forever.”",0

"Shannon Purser (Photo: Andrew Toth, Getty Images for American Express Platinum)  Shannon Purser, known for her role as Barb on Stranger Things, has come out as bisexual on Twitter.  “I don’t normally do this, but I figure now is as good a time as any to get personal. I’ve only just recently come out as bisexual to my friends and family,” she said in a photo posted to Twitter. “It’s something I am still processing and trying to understand and I don’t like talking about it too much.”  The tweet was seemingly prompted by previous tweets from upset Riverdale fans about the use of queerbaiting in the teen drama in which the actress also stars. LGBT viewers were hopeful that the two female leads, Betty and Veronica, would be an item thanks to a kiss shared early on in the series. But when nothing came to be, some criticized the show's use of girl-on-girl action for views.  @shannonpurser@colesprouse beronica fans are frustrated because they were blatantly, undeniably queerbaited into watching the show — jamie not spears (@jmiemarie) April 18, 2017  One twitter user, by the name of “jamie not spears,” tweeted “beronica fans are frustrated because they were blatantly, undeniably queerbaited into watching the show.”  Purser retweeted the user’s thread, responding, “And I get that, representation is so powerful and important. But we didn't write the show? We have literally no say in what happens.”  And I get that, representation is so powerful and important. But we didn't write the show?

That being said, I have never ever wanted to alienate anyone and my tweet was thoughtless. I wasn't referring to all the beronica shippers, just the ones who had been particularly cruel to me personally.""  Although this was the first explicit statement about her sexual orientation, the star hasn’t been shy about the topic of sexuality in the past.  Earlier this month, she took to Twitter to talk about the anxiety she experienced over her sexuality.  Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2pDtXbf",1

"Never say never! Gwen Stefani may have thought her pregnancy days were behind her, but she’s considering having one more baby to make Blake Shelton a dad. HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE details on how she’s been inspired by late-in-life mom Janet Jackson.  Age is nothing but a number when it comes to having a baby these days. Janet Jackson just proved miracles can happen by giving birth to a healthy son despite being 50-years-old. That has 47-year-old Gwen Stefani inspired to make her boyfriend Blake Shelton, 40, a first time dad. “Gwen would love to have another child with Blake. He’s not pressuring her at all, but she knows it’s something he would love too,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “She isn’t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility. It’s made her start to see it as something she and Blake really could make happen,” our insider adds. Gwen is already mom to three boys, Kingston, 10, eight-year-old Zuma and her littlest one Apollo, three. She’s made it known big time over the years how it would be a dream come true to have a little girl, so this could be the perfect chance!  The singer reminded us all why she really wants a daughter on The Voice Apr. 18 when commenting on her only female team member Brennley Brown. After the adorable teenage country singer performed “Fly” by Maddie & Tae, Gwen declared, “All I wanted was a little girl I could hang out with and play dress up with and — she’s my only girl and look at her!” Awww.

We can only imagine how doting a daddy Blake would be to an adorable daughter with Gwen!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Gwen and Blake would have a beautiful child?

He hosted the concert and performed the top-40 singles that he has written for the other artists. Tranter raised over $100,000 for the organization during the event.  ""We need to raise as much money as we can tonight to protect the kids out there that don't have the privilege of safety that I did,"" Tranter said.",1
"Aww! They're too cute!  enlisted the help of her BFF for a snuggle sash with her newborn daughter  The 20-year-old posted a video of the cuddly twosome on her Snapchat on Saturday. It's pretty clear that the first-time mom is over the moon about her little bundle of love.  Ever since Kylie welcomed her first child on Feb. 1 her best gal pal has been constantly by her side helping out. And judging from the video, it looks like Stormi and Jordan have quite the bond with each other.  Oh the video, Ky wrote, ""Can they get any cuter?""  After posting the snuggly Snapchat, Kylie and Jordan headed over to the Hotel Bel-Air to celebrate 's baby shower.

"Back in April, Page Six started a rumor about Brad Pitt and Sienna Miller. Sienna had a smaller, supporting role in The Lost City of Z, which Brad produced. He attended the LA premiere in April, and spent time with the cast at the premiere and the post-premiere dinner. It was at this dinner that Sienna and Brad allegedly were “heavily enjoying each other’s company” and “talking to each other all night,” according to Page Six’s witness. Sienna predictably gave a non-denial denial (“I’m not going to even dignify it with a response. It’s predictable and silly”) and Brad’s people called the story false. But guess what? Brad was in Glastonbury over the weekend, and he apparently spent a lot of time with Sienna. Where there’s smoke, etc.  Superstar Brad Pitt fuelled talk he is in the early stages of a new romance with Sienna Miller by cuddling up to the Brit actress at Glastonbury. The pair were seen holding hands and stroking each other during a late night party session on Worthy Farm over the weekend. The A-listers met up at 3am on Saturday morning in the festival’s exclusive Rabbit Hole area before retiring to their VIP Winnebago. A source revealed: “Brad and Sienna couldn’t keep their hands off each other, touching and stroking each other at every opportunity. They seemed really intimate. Brad had been keeping a relatively low profile at the festival, but emerged with the masses at 3am to link up with Sienna after she’d spent the night partying with their mutual pal Bradley Cooper and Noel Gallagher in the VIP Park backstage bar. They seemed keen to get away from prying eyes and made a dash for the Rabbit Hole, the festival’s underground and exclusive venue, with a group of friends and were inseparable as they waited to go inside. “The party was cut short and they had to leave after five minutes because the venue was closing. Bradley Cooper left and Brad and Sienna headed back arm in arm to their private Winnebago.” Brad, 53, was tee-total at the festival after revealing he had quit booze earlier this year to “become a better man” following his split from Angelina in August 2016.  [From The Sun]  To me, the operative words here are “backstage bar.” But I guess the words “stroking” and “intimate” and “arm in arm to their private Winnebago” are also important. All of the Brad-stans claimed Brad was just at Glastonbury to promote his movie and maybe to see Radiohead, right? If that’s all it was about, then why was he bar-hopping all night? As for this thing with Sienna Miller… she’s single, he’s single-ish, so it’s not like it’s some huge scandal. It is interesting though, because I have not been buying Sienna’s whitewashed narrative of the “reformed party girl/reformed drama queen” at all. Because Sienna is who she is and always has been, I tend to give more credence to these stories, because… let’s face it, this sounds so much like Vintage Sienna. One report can be shrugged off as an oddity, but twice in the span of less than three months? Come on. They’re happening. And it’s messy as hell.",0
"How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don’t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?",0
"It's a good time to be a '90s television fan, if only because the world has finally realized how much we miss our long-dead sitcoms. Full House is getting a spinoff series, Boy Meets World has a reincarnation in Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, and even the Magic School Bus is chugging back onto TV. So why not bring back Clarissa Explains It All? After all, the series launched Melissa Joan Hart's career AND provided us with endless hours of family-friendly entertainment, all told through the perspective of a savvy, colorfully dressed tween. We know where Hart is today — she's back polishing off yet another sitcom with Melissa & Joey and will probably make a plethora of ABC Family TV movies in the near future — but she's not the only person I want to keep track of post- Clarissa Explains It All . Whatever happened to Sam, aka actor Sean O'Neal?  I always wanted a BFF like Sam, if only because his mode of transportation (a ladder into Clarissa's bedroom window) always seemed pretty rad. The actor who played him, O'Neal, was in his early teens while on the show, and now is a full-fledged adult. So what has O'Neal been up to in his post-Clarissa years? There's not much out there about O'Neal's later years, but here's what I could find.  Noir  In 2001, O'Neal provided additional voices for an English dub of this anime series, as well as portraying the character Vint.  RahXephon  O'Neal also provided character voices for this anime series, which he worked on in 2002.  Development Hell  O'Neal appeared as a background actor on this 2013 web series about a production company.  Today  That's unfortunately all we know about O'Neal's post-Clarissa ventures in acting, but there are certain other things we do know about him. For example, we know that he is NOT the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club, though I'm sure it's been a struggle for the other Sean O'Neal to constantly explain to people that he was never on Clarissa Explains It All.  (You can see why we'd all believe it, though.)  Screencrush reported that when it was active, O'Neal's website said that after Clarissa Explains It All, ""he was approached to be the lead of a new boy band in Orlando in the vein of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync."" It would appear that such a band never happened, because I'm pretty sure all of Sam's many fans would've gladly bought his album — and there's no record of it ever existing. Here's what appears to a recent photo of O'Neal, or at least, more recent than old Clarissa episodes.  So where'd you go, O'Neal? Are you secretly lying to the world and really ARE the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club? Have you gone into hiding because too many '90s girls want you to climb into their windows? Or are you just leading a perfectly happy, normal life somewhere out of the public eye? If you want to talk, feel free to drop me a line — or better yet, just climb in through the window.

"Christina Aguilera celebrated the release of new album Liberation by donning a disguise and busking in the New York subway alongside Jimmy Fallon on Thursday’s Tonight Show. Midway through the episode, the singer’s eighth studio LP officially arrived, as Fallon told Aguilera during the interview.  Aguilera wore a wig and a face-obscuring hat for the incognito performance, which has become a viral staple for the Tonight Show; previous “buskers” include Maroon 5 and U2.  However, the disguises are pretty much for naught as, within 10 seconds into their cover of Aretha Franklin’s “Think,” it’s evident that the voice booming out of this subway performer is unmistakably Aguilera’s. Before the buskers even hit the first chorus, a throng of passersby stop and whip out their cellphones to capture the unique performance.  With the ruse obviously up, Fallon and Aguilera shed the costumes and continued to entertain the congregators with an acoustic rendition of the singer’s Stripped single “Fighter.”  Aguilera offered up a third Tonight Show performance – this time in Rockefeller Center as opposed to under it – with the Liberation single “Fall in Line”:",1
"Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston.  Welcome to You Know What I Heard, the Cut’s weekly celebrity gossip column about the peregrinations of the rich and famous. Have gossip? Email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal (ask for the number).  When Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their breakup last Thursday evening, they did so with a joint statement issued by Aniston’s longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane. It had Jen written all over it: The statement called out the malicious “gossip industry” and insisted that “whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative.”  Since Thursday, a lot has been printed about the split, and a lot of it seems to be coming from Theroux’s friends. So who’s really running this breakup?  Sources close to Theroux in New York have been telling “Page Six” that Theroux was “really bored by [Aniston’s] whole Hollywood crowd” and that he “initiated” the separation. Unfortunately for Aniston, Official Hollywood Bible People has more or less backed up those “Page Six” reports, citing sources who say that Theroux was done with the marriage and wanted to take the breakup public ASAP.  In one report, published Sunday, a source close to Aniston told People that “Jen didn’t want to announce [the split] for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention.” But Theroux didn’t play ball. Instead, he walked around getting photographed in New York throughout Aniston’s birthday weekend, while Aniston celebrated at home with girlfriends in L.A. (We definitely noticed that last week.)  “Jen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren’t wondering why he wasn’t with her, but that’s not Justin’s style,” People’s source said. “He wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.” Theroux apparently flew to L.A. to talk to Aniston three days after her birthday (on Valentine’s Day!), and Aniston agreed to release a statement the next day.  So: Theroux initiated the breakup and took it public before Aniston was ready because … why? What life does he want to live? The Sun reported this weekend that one source of contention in his marriage to Aniston was his desire to “party” with the “New York art scene.” Specifically, Sun sources claimed that Aniston was upset over Theroux’s desire to hang out with 25-year-old photographer and “art beauty” Petra Collins.  👽👶🏼🌝🔪 A post shared by Petra Collins (@petrafcollins) on Jan 26, 2018 at 10:02am PST  The Sun tends to be more accurate when reporting on British stars (like Taylor Swift’s boyfriends), so who knows where its reporters are getting this information, but Theroux and Collins do know each other. Collins shot Theroux for a spread in L’uomo Vogue last year. The shoot took place at Paul’s Baby Grand in Tribeca; you can see it on Collins’s website.  Hypothetically, what would a Collins-Theroux romance mean for gossip? Collins isn’t just an indie darling; she’s also a collaborator and close friend of Selena Gomez. Gomez has publicly gushed, many times, about how much she loves Aniston. (They met a few years ago through their management.) Will Gomez have to pick a side?  Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston.  Another curious element in all of this: Aniston and Theroux may not be legally married at all. Though they had a surprise wedding in the back yard of Aniston’s Bel Air mansion in 2015, TMZ reported this weekend that the couple never filed for a marriage license, confidentially or otherwise, in L.A. County. And neither Aniston nor Theroux has hired a divorce lawyer.  Theroux’s friends may be talking to the tabloids, but Theroux himself is not ready to address the rumors: He backed out of a scheduled appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert tonight.  Selena Gomez, meanwhile, is reportedly in Jamaica with Justin Bieber for Bieber’s dad’s wedding. Jeremy Bieber, 42, is marrying his “longtime girlfriend” Chelsey Rebelo, 29. Here’s a photo of Gomez posing with some of Rebelo’s friends and relatives:  So Gomez and Bieber are going strong, despite her family’s disapproval. According to People, the on-again couple spent Valentine’s Day with a visit to Hillsong and a makeout at the Montage in Beverly Hills.  We haven’t heard much from Ben Affleck and his SNL-producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus so far this year, but you’ll be happy to know they are still together and still color-coordinating their outfits.  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.  According to E! News, the couple spent Valentine’s Day house-hunting in L.A. “They visited two homes in the $8 million–$10 million range with a broker who gave them tours,” a source told the site. Those homes were in the tony neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, where Affleck’s ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives with their three kids. The house tours were very romantic, apparently.  “While Ben and Lindsay were waiting for the first house to be opened, Ben grabbed Lindsay on the doorstep and pulled her in close for a hug,” E!’s source said. “They were swaying back and forth hugging and laughing. He kissed her on the forehead. He walked with his arm around her and put his hand on her lower back. They seemed very happy and close.”  Shookus can’t be planning to move to L.A. full-time, though, can she? Her daughter and ex-husband live in New York. And she has SNL. Currently, she’s living in Affleck’s $28,000-a-month rental on the Upper West Side.  One small blessing from this week:  Here is a photo of Rooney Mara and her boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix going to a mall in Sherman Oaks.  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.  Jennifer Lawrence.  Finally, I’ll leave you with this TimesTalk Jennifer Lawrence did last week to promote her new spy thriller Red Sparrow. During the talk, she said she’d like to use her character’s skills to figure out “what’s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift.”  “That’s the God’s honest truth,” she added. “[It’s] keeping me up at night.”  Love or hate J.Law, she is a great gossip. Most celebrities pretend not to pay attention to the tabloids, but she regularly brings up feuds and rumors in public conversations. (See this appearance on Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live! or her interview with Kim Kardashian West on Jimmy Kimmel’s show.) I, too, would love to know why Kloss and Swift broke up. This past weekend, Kloss attended the NBA All-Star Game with her boyfriend Josh Kushner. Before that, she was spotted hanging out with sworn-Swift-enemy Katy Perry. Swift has been hanging out with herself. Will J.Law’s comment prompt Swift to make a statement?  Thanks so much for gossiping this week.

"Chrissy Teigen Posts Photo of Luna and Miles Taking a Bath Together — and Her Caption Is Spot On  Chrissy Teigen posted two photos of her kids — Luna and Miles — taking a bath, and if you have a social media account, there's a very good chance that you already know what the internet usually has to say about that. Which is why the mom of two was one step ahead of potential online trolls and posted a caption condemning anyone who had a negative thing to say about her sink-bathing babies.  ""Heart explodes,"" she wrote alongside the first snap. ""And heads up, if you have some weird issue with this, you're weird.""  Although some commenters admonished her for not caring ""about all the perverts out there"" and insisted that she keep naked photos like this private, most of her fans applauded her message and hilariously took issue with everything but her adorable kiddos.  ADVERTISEMENT  ""The only problem I have with this is your sink is about as big as my bathtub,"" one person wrote. Another echoed the sentiment: ""I have an issue with the copper faucet . . . I want one!""  Still others noticed the ""creepy red doll on the side of the sink."" One person wrote: ""I have a HUGE issue with the staples in the back of Elmo's head. WHO HURT HIM?"" to which Teigen replied, ""oh my god he's a monster I didn't notice.""  Finally, others marveled at the ""baby bucket"" in the second photo. Apparently, baby buckets such as those mimic the feeling of floating in the womb and are even safer for babies than a normal tub where they can more easily slip.  Fans joked: ""nobody puts baby in a bucket,"" and ""You could have taken the leaves out first.""",1

"After receiving disappointingly low scores from the judges during the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Ashley Wagner spoke out against the judges who stood between her and her dream of competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics.  After Friday’s competition — in which Wagner finished in fourth place — she revealed that was was “absolutely furious,” according to The Salt Lake Tribune.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 26-year-old Olympic bronze medalist added that “For me to put out two programs that I did at this competition as solid as I skated and to get those scores, I am furious, and I think deservedly so.”  Matthew Stockman/Getty Images  “I honestly think that at the end of the day, this is how I feel, and I feel like I need to stick up for myself, and I think that I delivered when I really needed to,” Wagner continued. “I think all these girls delivered when they needed to, but I want to be on that Olympic team and I’m really mad that I’m in this position again.”  Although Wagner was given the chance to represent the United States at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi after finishing in fourth in the U.S. Championships that year — edging out skater Mirai Nagasu who had finished in third place — on Saturday it was announced that Wagner would not be so lucky again. She was named as Team USA’s first alternate.  RELATED VIDEO: Even Olympians Have Bad Days! Figure Skater Ashley Wagner Shares What Keeps Her Going  Wagner previously opened up to PEOPLE about what it would have meant to get to compete in the Pyeongchang Olympics as a 26-year-old woman.  “To be a 26-year-old woman on the ice is an achievement in this sport because you’re working against a lot of different things,” she said. “If I got to Pyeongchang, I will be the oldest U.S. female figure skating athlete since 1924 or something like that — so I think it really goes to show that my longevity is something that’s very, very rare. And I’m really proud of that, and it’s because I’m so freakin’ stubborn.”  And while the road to Pyeongchang was not always easy for the three-time national champion, Wagner never lost sight of her goal.  “I think that if anyone tells you that they’ve been that hungry every single day of their career, they’re not being honest,” Wagner added. “You have days where you don’t want to train. I mean, I’ve been skating for 22 years — this absolutely gets old. But it’s one of those things where I set a goal when I was 6, 7 years old and I owe it to that little girl … to see this through.”  Ashley Wagner Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  The 2018 Games, beginning on Feb. 8, would have been Wagner’s third Olympic experience. In addition to receiving a bronze medal at the team-skating event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, she was a first alternate at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  The three women who were chosen to compete for the United States in Pyeongchang next month are Bradie Tennell, Karen Chen and Mirai Nagasu — the figure skater who Wagner beat out for a spot on the Olympic team in 2014.",1
"Robbie eventually landed an audition for the latest Martin Scorsese movie at that time, The Wolf of Wall Street. She was brought in to audition with leading man Leonardo DiCaprio, but the audition didn't go quite as planned. Robbie later described the meetin with Harper's Bazaar UK (via People), saying, ""In my head I was like, 'You have literally 30 seconds left in this room and if you don't do something impressive, nothing will ever come of it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance, just take it'…And so I start screaming at him [Leo] and he's yelling back at me."" The scene was an intense fight between husband and wife.  She continued, ""So I walk up really close to his face and then I'm like, Maybe I should kiss him. When else am I ever going to get a chance to kiss Leo DiCaprio, ever? But another part of my brain clicks and I just go, 'Whack!' I hit him in the face … And that's not in the script at all. The room just went dead silent and I froze."" But it seems the slap was what ended up getting Robbie the role. She stayed in character, and it paid off.  Robbie originally wasn't the biggest fan of her role, but she eventually embraced just how fierce her character, Naomi Lapaglia, really was.

"Film star says he'll give up his trade when he turns 50  He’s one of the hottest properties in Hollywood, commanding multimillion dollar fees for his films – but Brad Pitt’s acting days are soon to be something of the past, it seems.  Advertisement  The 47-year-old actor has said he plans to give up on movies in just three years’ time, when he turns 50.  Pitt dropped the bombshell whilst speaking to Australian television show 60 Minutes to promote his latest film, Moneyball.  When asked what he might do next, he replied: “Hell if I know.”  However, the actor hinted that he may continue to work in film behind the camera as a producer “getting stories to the plate that may have had a harder time otherwise.”  Pitt’s acting career began in 1987, although it was for his performance in the 1991 road movie, Thelma and Louise, that he first gained widespread attention.

"The rumour: Meghan Markle had a secret first husband  Where you heard it: The National Enquirer  The report: Markle’s status as divorcée has never been in dispute, but according to a new “bombshell” Enquirer cover story (is there any other kind?), Prince Harry will be the ex-actress’s third kick at the matrimonial can. “How she HID PAST from Husband No. 2!” claims one scandalous cover line, referring to “Man-eater Meghan’s” ex Trevor Engelson. Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was “blindsided” by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a “hush-hush annulment.”  Subscribe To Our Newsletters — And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox  The smell test: For the love of Liverpool — this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It’s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she’s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn’t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we’re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what’s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even “hush-hush annulments” are a matter of public record. The Enquirer’s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty’s Secret Service) probably “scrubbed the records” to conceal Markle’s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.  The rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie  Where you heard it: Vanity Fair  The report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple’s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It’s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” the movie’s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his “wife’s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.”  The smell test: What really reeks here is Huda’s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife’s connection, you can be sure he won’t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude — it’s called protecting your source.) Is the palace “seriously worried” about this movie? It’s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it’s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they’d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan’s premarital sex-fest wasn’t coming soon to a TV near you, but it’s not like it’s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal — a 1 being Kate Middleton’s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles’s tampon ambitions — this is a 2.  The rumour: Meghan’s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah  Where you heard it: The Mirror  The report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle’s mom visited Winfrey’s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O’s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed “US TV source,” who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: “It’s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,” quoth The Mirror’s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.  Rumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton ‘Hate Each Other’s Guts.’ Is That Really The Case?  The smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a “tell-all” if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a “tell-none” approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it’s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.  The rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring  Where you heard it: E! News  The report: This will-he-or-won’t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap “does want to wear a wedding band.” Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen’s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.  The smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that’s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan’s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.",0
"For most of the history of television, the barrier to syndication—and to profitability—has been 100 episodes. The shows that have made it to that mark are an unusual group. Many were big hits. Some found small cult audiences. Still others just hung on as best they could and never posted numbers quite low enough to be canceled. In 100 Episodes, we examine the shows that made it to that number, considering both how they advanced and reflected the medium and what contributed to their popularity. This entry covers MTV’s The Challenge, which started in 1998 and completed its 26th season this year.  MTV’s long-running reality competition The Challenge has earned a reputation for stasis due to the frequency with which the same cohort of Bunim-Murray Productions alumni participates. For 17 years and 26 seasons, reality pioneer Bunim-Murray has been rounding up cast members from its Road Rules and The Real World franchises and pitting them against each other for cash and prizes, often with the same faces returning again and again. Although the lack of cast churn makes The Challenge seem static, the show has evolved more dramatically than any reality competition on the dial. Shows like Big Brother and Top Chef remain more or less identical to how they began. Meanwhile, The Challenge has changed its format, its host, and even its genre. It has gone from being an average, competent reality-adventure show to a heavily serialized, reality-based workplace drama.    Advertisement  The Challenge technically premiered in June 1998, but its earliest incarnation couldn’t be more different than what the show is now. The debut season didn’t even have the word “challenge” in its title. Road Rules: All Stars was Bunim-Murray’s first formal cross-pollination of its successful reality brands, and it grew out of a playful franchise rivalry in which each season’s Road Rules gang would try to prank the Real World cast currently in production. All Stars followed Road Rules’ standard format except that instead of a group of collegiate unknowns, an assorted quintet of former Real World housemates teamed up for an action-packed road trip with the promise of a “handsome reward” awaiting them at the final destination. All Stars had no eliminations, duels, or cash prizes, and the primary draw was watching Real World’s spoiled homebodies in more taxing, goal-focused scenarios. The show didn’t feature bone-crushing physical challenges, and was instead fueled by Amazing Race-style travel excursions such as sheep shearing and spending the night in a purportedly haunted mental hospital.  The Road Rules facsimile format remained intact until the fifth season, 2002’s Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle Of The Seasons, in which the producers eliminated the Winnebago trips and began housing the cast in swanky, isolated villas. The new format inverted the show’s original concept; rather than expose the coddled Real World housemates to a relatively harsh life on the road, the Road Rules cast members were granted a taste of the tony Real World lifestyle. The change was all the more significant because of when it took place—as Bunim-Murray was in production on Real World: Las Vegas, the season in which that show completed its transformation from an earnest examination of difference to a boozy bacchanal. The massive success of the Las Vegas season, which embodied the city’s den-of-iniquity image, affirmed The Real World’s tonal shift. And as The Challenge started to resemble The Real World, it naturally developed its forebear’s appetite for hook-ups, blow-ups, and drunken debauchery.    Advertisement  By Battle Of The Seasons, The Challenge had gone from a friendly rivalry to a fierce competition after three seasons as a six-on-six face-off between teams representing Road Rules and Real World, a face-off Road Rules almost always won. Battle Of The Seasons kept the franchise rivalry component, but the cast was expanded considerably, up from 12 contestants to 32, each of them paired up with housemates from their respective seasons. Seasons was also the first year The Challenge tapped into the contestants’ greed. In the early seasons, even the six-on-six faceoffs, producers promised an extravagant reward for winning, but it’s framed as secondary to the friendships formed, fears conquered, and life lessons learned. Seasons incented its cast mates up front with a $300,000 cash pool.  Seasons also offers early glimpses of the serialized storytelling that has come to characterize The Challenge at its best. In the third episode, “Musical Inner-Tube Tango,” the entire cast turns against Real World: Seattle alum Stephen Williams, who strong-arms his way to a victory in a pool game by allegedly hitting female competitors in the face. Anyone else might have been able to chalk up the behavior to heat-of-the-moment adrenaline, but not Williams, whose Real World legacy was an equally blithe assault on a female castmate. At that point, The Challenge’s internal continuity was in its infancy, but Williams’ radioactivity is an early example of how Real World and Road Rules mythology shaped The Challenge’s storytelling. Williams was later voted off, as Seasons introduced Survivor-style democratic eliminations to the show, which would later be replaced with sudden-death physical duels as elimination rounds.  The Challenge didn’t begin to take its present shape until its 12th season, 2006’s Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Fresh Meat. After shuffling hosting duties between an assortment of Bunim-Murray affiliates and X Games athletes, BMX biker T.J. Lavin was hired as The Challenge’s permanent host. As the subtitle suggests, Fresh Meat was the first Challenge season to feature newbies who had not appeared on The Real World or Road Rules. The concept was a risky one since the show had spent years emphasizing the appeal of familiar personalities exposed to unfamiliar stressors. But it was a necessary experiment given that the Road Rules cast pipeline was drying up after MTV placed Road Rules on hiatus due to its flagging ratings. Though there are currently more than 200 former Real World cast members, as opposed to only 90 Road Rules cast members, Road Rules experience is a better predictor of Challenge success. Bunim-Murray occasionally has great luck casting Real World housemates with athletic prowess, but the company has repeatedly said it doesn’t consider The Challenge when casting a Real World season. Road Rules is a magnet for the sporty, adventurous types that take especially well to The Challenge’s physical and mental endurance tests. Unsurprisingly, the new Fresh Meat cast members, the first to sign up specifically to appear on The Challenge, adapted well to the competition and became recurring contestants.    Advertisement  Fresh Meat was instrumental to The Challenge’s serialization, and marked the beginning of its evolution into a workplace drama. Fresh Meat (and 2010’s Fresh Meat II) gave The Challenge many of its most enduring characters, those who rose from unknowns to fan favorites as the show’s serialized storytelling took root. The new additions included Evan Starkman, Kenny Santucci, Evelyn Smith, and Diem Brown, who would go on to make a combined 29 appearances in 15 seasons of the show. The four of them have collided and collaborated over years of being put through The Challenge’s wringer, and they’ve forged emotionally complex relationships, as have many of the recurring cast mates.  Many of those relationships formed in the following season, 2007’s Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Duel, which premiered only a month after Fresh Meat’s finale and proved to be another seminal season in The Challenge’s evolution. The season marked the first appearance from the legendary Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio, who made his first Challenge appearance almost immediately after shooting Real World: Key West. He was sent home in the first episode of the season, a humiliation he has seemingly dedicated his life to neutralizing. Since The Duel, Devenanzio has appeared in 11 seasons of The Challenge, sitting out only three times since becoming eligible to compete. He won five of the 11 seasons on which he appeared, thanks in part to essentially writing the rule book for The Challenge’s complex political and social dynamics.  To the extent The Challenge has a “main cast,” it began to form during The Duel. The season also featured Paula Meronek, one of Devenanzio’s Key West housemates, Fresh Meat’s Starkman and Santucci, Chris “C.T.” Tamburello of Real World: Paris, and Real World: Chicago’s Aneesa Ferreira, who if not for the zealous Devenanzio, would hold the title for most appearances with 10 seasons under her belt. And those are just a few of the Challenge diehards that appeared on The Duel. Of The Duel’s 20 competitors, 13 of them participated in at least five of the subsequent 10 seasons, and Devenanzio appeared in eight of the 10.  Advertisement  The conventional wisdom regarding The Challenge began to solidify at this point, with Bunim-Murray taking heat from fans and the press for allowing cast members to repeatedly circle back to the show, a practice that sets The Challenge apart from the typical, annually restocked reality competitions. The producers weren’t the only ones scrutinized. As The Challenge progressed with the polarizing Devenanzio as a near-constant presence, the cast members were frequently mocked. The conversation shifted to how ridiculous it was that, for cast members like Devenanzio and Ferreira, participating in The Challenge every season is what passes for steady employment in the age of reality stardom. That’s a fair criticism, but one that misses the point of what makes the show work. The Challenge isn’t like a job for its cast, it is a job, which is why it has developed the characteristics of a drama about a highly dysfunctional workplace.  The main cast members practically have lifetime appointments to the show because they’ve met the necessary job criteria, the most important of which is dedication to The Challenge. Cast members have to be available to be spirited away to Prague or Phuket with little notice and for an indefinite length of time, an unworkable arrangement for anyone with children or a traditional job. Participation in The Challenge is a fraught proposition for anyone in a happy, stable romantic relationship with someone outside the Bunim-Murray network. Relationships back home routinely crumble when the young, attractive, and boozy cast members convene, which is why cast members often talk about cutting all romantic ties before leaving to compete on the show.  Recurring cast members are also required to have fiercely competitive natures, high thresholds for pain, and boundless enthusiasm for action sports. The Challenge has become a grueling, physical gauntlet in which painful injuries are par for the course. Each season builds to a triathlon-inspired race that takes the dizzying heights, deep waters, high altitudes, frigid temperatures, and endurance tests common to Challenge missions and amplifies them. The final missions are often so punishing, the show’s medical team is forced to rush in with stretchers and oxygen tanks to evacuate ailing competitors. Although Bunim-Murray theoretically has access to hundreds of potential candidates, the nature of the show makes participation unappealing, if not impossible, for all but those who have committed to making The Challenge their life’s work.  As The Challenge became a job for its best-known cast members, it took on the same dynamics of a workplace, complete with the constant formation and dissolution of strategic alliances, rivalries, friendships, and flings. The show developed a harsh, abusive workplace culture that, while awful, closely resembles traditional corporate environments. The Challenge’s office politics are due largely to Devenanzio’s influence, under which the Real World-Road Rules rivalry was supplanted by the idea that, irrespective of how they came to The Challenge, veterans must align against rookies. That shift turned The Challenge into a who-you-know game in which a lack of relationships outside the game makes upward mobility practically impossible for newbies.    Advertisement  Backstabbing is rampant in The Challenge, and because of the cast continuity, grudges die hard. As experienced players, the cast members should have thick skin with regard to the game. Instead, they treat every maneuver that adversely affects them as a deeply personal slight. In The Challenge, a player’s vote to send another into an elimination duel is almost never viewed as a dispassionate strategic choice. It’s viewed as a referendum on the strength and quality of the relationship between the two. And those relationships don’t end when the cameras go off because so many of the cast members spend time together when the show is not in production. The Bunim-Murray network is infamously incestuous, and much of The Challenge’s cast maintains outside friendships, romantic relationships, and beefs with their Bunim-Murray colleagues. The interactions that aren’t documented become part of the mythology once the cameras are back on.  The serialized, workplace drama framework allows The Challenge to tell longitudinal relationship stories most reality competitions cannot. Unlike the relationships forged in a show like Survivor, a finite experience with complete strangers, the relationships in The Challenge have length and depth. The friendships endure, and the romantic pairings aren’t fly-by-night showmances, they’re refreshingly layered and messy. The producers have learned to capitalize on these relationships by conceptualizing seasons around them. In the Rivals and Battle Of The Exes seasons, cast mates are paired up based on past conflicts or ill-advised hook-ups, and must work through their differences to ensure their shot at the prize money. As cynical as the practice sounds, building The Challenge around its relationships yields real human drama, like in Brown’s relationship with Tamburello, which became The Challenge’s most affecting ongoing storyline.    Advertisement  After appearing in Fresh Meat, Brown returned to participate in The Duel, which was filmed not long after Brown received a round of radiation therapy that sent her cancer into remission. She meets Tamburello, a Real World: Paris alum and future Challenge legend, and they take a shine to each other. Before long Brown and Tamburello are an item, and she’s crediting him with helping to restore the confidence and self-esteem she lost when her hair fell out due to chemotherapy. In one of The Challenge’s most poignant moments, Tamburello kisses Brown for the first time after encouraging her to remove her wig. Later, Brown gathers the courage to take off the wig during a mission, revealing the regrown pixie that had made her feel so self-conscious. Brown and Tamburello dated for a year and a half after The Duel, then broke up when Brown decided to focus on her career.  Get More: The Challenge: Battle of the Exes 2, The Challenge: Battle of the Exes 2, Full Episodes  Advertisement  Had Brown and Tamburello met on any other reality competition, they would have likely gone their separate ways. But as Challenge colleagues, they had to continue seeing each other whether or not their relationship was harmonious at the time. When they’re happy, they give the impression that they would have fallen in love no matter where or how they had met. When they fight, there’s genuine, relatable emotions on both sides. Tamburello was justifiably hurt when Brown chose her career over their relationship and declined to attend the funeral of his murdered brother. But empathizing with Brown was just as easy. It’s understandable that someone who spent years of her life fighting intractable ovarian cancer would experience anxiety about achieving her professional goals, and would dread attending a funeral for a young person whose life was cut short. The couple made its final appearance in this year’s Battle Of The Exes II, where they appear to be in a loving, peaceful place. But it doesn’t last long. Tamburello gladly leaves the competition with her when her illness leaves her unable to continue beyond the third episode. Brown died in November 2014, and Tamburello was by her side in her final days.    Brown and Tamburello’s relationship is a perfect example of the serialization that makes The Challenge so fascinating at its best. After years of wringing drama out of shuffling strangers together, reality producers have slowly figured out that they don’t necessarily have to build character relationships from scratch every season. Just as it’s interesting to watch people forge new relationships under stressful circumstances, it’s also interesting to see already solid relationships tested in unexpected ways, which is why The Amazing Race became such a hit. Other reality competitions have flirted with recurring characters and novel character dynamics, but none has gone so far as The Challenge. Because of The Challenge’s workplace dynamic, it can offer the best of both worlds. New relationships take shape, then are either buttressed or bruised by continued participation in the game as alliances are negotiated and renegotiated.  The Challenge’s transformation hasn’t been completely for the better, and the same changes that bolstered the storytelling have also made the show’s tone and environment increasingly toxic. The show’s strong emphasis on athletic achievement is to blame. By making the missions so physically demanding, The Challenge producers rob themselves of the opportunity to cast older or less athletically gifted cast members. By contrast, Survivor, The Challenge’s only direct peer, has grown less physically arduous over its 30-season run. Survivor increasingly relies on puzzle challenges that, in addition to lending themselves to suspenseful, neck-and-neck editing, allow for a more generationally diverse group of competitors that has yielded winners as old as 57. This fall’s new season of Survivor will feature the oldest cast in the show’s history. The Challenge could never pull that off, which is a shame because one of the joys of this kind of show is seeing how cast members use their strengths, like charm or leadership, to compensate for their athletic weaknesses. In The Challenge, the only way to win is to win, and even the most estimable athletes often find themselves ill-prepared.  Advertisement  Get More: MTV Shows  The focus on athleticism has made The Challenge a sporty boys club, subtly (when not outright) hostile toward women, the out-of-shape, the differently abled, and the uncoordinated. As the missions have gotten more physically taxing, there’s been an uptick in insults and verbal abuse directed at cast members who fall short during competition. It’s extremely common to hear contestants of both genders offering gendered exhortations like “be a man” and “grow some balls” if a player’s performance is lacking. In some cases even less is required, as in 2010’s The Challenge: Cutthroat, when a drunken Laurel Stucky unleashes a vicious tirade against fellow Fresh Meat alum Eric Banks—who isn’t even on her team—and shames him for being overweight. The incident takes place in a hot tub as two female cast mates make out nearby, making the clip a perfect miniature model of the Bunim-Murray brand.    Advertisement  Get More: The Challenge (Season 20), Full Episodes  Like Stucky’s heinous outburst, many of The Challenge’s interpersonal conflicts are fueled by alcohol, which the producers make readily available. Free-flowing booze has long been a fixture on The Real World, and bad choices have frequently ensued as a result of overconsumption. But the stakes are higher for The Challenge because the environment is defined by unchecked machismo and it’s all too easy for the sanctioned physical violence during a competition to spill over into an assault back at the villa. Fist fights are not uncommon in an average Challenge season, and people have been seriously injured in stupid, drunken skirmishes. One of the show’s most indelibly violent moments came in the 18th season, 2009’s The Ruins, when a surly, soused Brad Fiorenza provoked Darrell Taylor, a decision he would later come to regret after Taylor, a trained boxer, lost his composure and showered him with blows to the face. Both men were sent home, but in a reflection of a larger reality television trend, the producers have gotten increasingly lax over the years about how much physical violence between cast mates warrants direct intervention. No matter how violent a competitor’s past appearances on the show, they’re always welcomed back.    Advertisement  Get More: The Challenge (Season 18), Full Episodes  The producers were recently accused of specifically failing to make The Challenge a safe environment for female cast members. Tonya Cooley, formerly of Real World: Chicago, filed a civil suit against MTV, Bunim-Murray, and cast mates Starkman and Santucci following her appearance on 2009’s Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Ruins, alleging the men sexually assaulted her with a toothbrush while she was incapacitated and the producers made no attempt to stop it. The suit was later settled out of court, but fellow Ruins cast member Susie Meister attested to the allegedly unsafe environment in an essay, recalling a harrowing encounter during one of her four appearances on the show.    During a previous season, two cast members drunkenly came into my bedroom, woke me up, and one of them climbed the ladder to my bunk bed. He later said he was just being “playful” and “having a good time,” but the behavior was still aggressive and unwelcome. After I said no, yelled no, and swore at him, he still refused to descend the ladder and leave the room. I punched him and he fell to the floor. The other cast members called for me to be sent home for violence and one male cast member said that “I shouldn’t come on these shows if I don’t want to party.” Almost everyone on the cast felt it was I, not he, who had acted inappropriately. I was not sent home, and production was supportive of me. I do not know if the reason I was not sent home was because I was defending myself or because the incident wasn’t caught on camera, and thus would have made my dismissal confusing for the show’s “plot.”  Advertisement  Meister’s nuanced essay speaks to why The Challenge can be so alluring, even at its worst, and how producers managed to talk her into four appearances. She liked being told she was worth watching on television, and each time the producers assured her she had good odds of winning. She hates the job, but can’t resist whenever the bosses want to put her back on active duty, a description that probably applies to most of Meister’s colleagues. The shame of it is that while The Challenge was becoming a great workplace drama, it was also becoming a terrible workplace.  It’s a dysfunctional environment that should ring familiar for anyone who watched UnREAL, Lifetime’s terrifically dark drama set behind the scenes of a Bachelor-style reality dating competition called Everlasting. The Bachelor makes the perfect source material for UnREAL’s meditation on the massive gap between the romantic fantasy reality dating shows peddle and the ugly process of creating that fantasy. But in terms of how reality TV producers let their morals fall by the wayside, UnREAL is more thematically akin to The Challenge than it is to The Bachelor.  More often than not, participants in reality competitions do so once, then go on to lead normal lives with normal jobs. The Challenge’s elite players are lifers, far closer to being producers without the title than unwitting participants. Like UnREAL’s conflicted producer Rachel (Shiri Appleby), they must reconcile the guilt of being complicit in creating a toxic and frequently dangerous work environment with the tawdry thrills that come with participation. And like Rachel, they keep coming back for more. The show’s 27th season, currently in post-production, will feature a group mostly comprised of long-time Challenge staffers (including Devenanzio and Ferreira) paired with their blood relatives. At this point, The Challenge cast members are staying in an abusive relationship to collect paychecks, but that means the only difference between them and most working stiffs is a more heavily stamped passport.",1
"In an emotional monologue on his show, Jimmy Kimmel told the story of his son's harrowing first few days after being diagnosed with rare and potentially dangerous cardiac defects.  Interested in Jimmy Kimmel? Add Jimmy Kimmel as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jimmy Kimmel news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host was sometimes brought to tears as he talked about how his newborn son William was diagnosed with ""tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia.""  He recounted that a nurse first noticed something was wrong with William, when he was only a few hours old, noting that the infant ""was a bit purple."" The baby was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit where the medical staff started to see signs that something was wrong with his heart.  ""The room started to fill up. More doctors, nurses, and equipment started coming in and they determined that he wasn’t getting enough oxygen into his blood,"" Kimmel said. ""It’s a terrifying thing.""  The infant was eventually taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where doctors performed open-heart surgery to help his heart function. The initial surgery went well but Kimmel said his son will need at least two surgeries in the future.  Here's a look at the rare birth defects and how they're detected.  What is the condition?  Kimmel said his newborn son was diagnosed with the tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia, which actually describes two congenital heart defects.  The condition tetralogy of fallot is characterized by a combination of multiple defects that affect the heart's structure and function. There is a hole in the wall between the lower chambers of the heart, an obstruction from the heart to the lungs and the aorta -- the major blood vessel into the heart -- lying over the lower chambers of the heart, according to the American Heart Association. As a result of the defect, blood is not fully oxygenated as it flows through the body, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Kimmel's newborn son had an additional complication where the valve that allows blood flow to the pulmonary artery is blocked. This is called pulmonary atresia.  How often does it occur?  Tetrology of fallot is estimated to occur in about 5 for every 10,000 live births, according to the National Institutes of Health.  In general, heart conditions are among the most common birth defects, according to Dr. Eric Devaney, Chief of Pediatric Cardiac and Thoracic Surgery at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital .  ""A lot of the defects that are apparent when the baby is born [are] obscured by the fact that the placenta deals with gas flow,"" Devaney said, explaining the placenta would be able to oxygenate the blood in utero.  What are the symptoms?  Symptoms of this condition can vary depending on the severity of the defect. In extreme cases, babies can appear blue-ish or ""cyanotic"" because their blood isn't being oxygenated properly. An infant may also have a heart murmur.  If the defect isn't as pronounced, the condition may not be diagnosed until the infants are older. Some babies have ""Tet spells"" where they cry and then pass out. These spells are caused by a sudden drop in oxygen, due to the malformed heart. In these cases, the infants may be agitated and suddenly develop blue skin, nails or lips, they can also be at risk for fainting or even death.  How is it treated?  To help the heart function properly, surgeons generally have to perform open heart surgery to fix the defect. Surgeons will work to fix the hole in the heart and open up the pulmonary artery to help the blood flow more easily, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Often doctors will perform the surgery in stages, first creating a shunt to help with blood flow before a more extensive surgery is done to fix the problem. Children will generally need life-long care by a cardiologist to monitor any complications over time.  Dr. Karen Kagha is a dermatology resident and a resident at ABC News Medical Unit",1

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Angelina Jolie is being consoled by her former co-star Johnny Depp in the wake of her split from Brad Pitt, it's been claimed.  The mum-of-six, 41, and Johnny starred together in romantic thriller Tourist back in 2009 and are said to have remained friends ever since.  The pair also share the same divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, who represented Johnny through his divorce from estranged wife Amber Heard.  Johnny, 53, reportedly recommended Laura, who has worked with a string of high-profile celebrity clients in the past, to Angelina after the actress was there to support him during his bitter break up.  ""Angelina idolised Johnny for years before she worked with him on The Tourist, and then the pair of them really hit it off on set,"" a source claimed to The Sun.  They continued: “But the two of them have stayed in touch ever since then, and spoke regularly during the storm that surrounded Johnny’s break up with Amber.

But they have been speaking about the situation, and Angelina hired Johnny’s lawyer to represent her based on the advice that he has given her.  “Her friends are now speculating about what could happen between them if she and Brad are not reconciled and their divorce goes through.”  Meanwhile, Hollywood star Brad - who is said to be 'wrecked' by the fact he hasn't been able to see his kids - is at the centre of claims he clashed with 15-year-old son Maddox on board a private plane days before his wife filed for divorce.  TMZ reports that although the FBI is investigating the incident between Brad, 52, and Maddox, the case is likely to be dropped as conflicting accounts make it impossible to prove what happened.  And according to the website: ""DCFS [Department of Children & Family Services] social workers saw no evidence of injuries on Maddox and no one filed a police report after the incident.""  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  Sources close to Brad have previously insisted that allegations of abuse against him are ""exaggerated and fabricated"" with sources close to the actor hitting out at the ""smear campaign"" against him.  A source told DailyMail.com: ""These claims are exaggerated and fabricated.  ""It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.  ""They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of verbal disagreements like major households.  (Image: Getty Images)  ""Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.""  Maddox was adopted by Angelina from Cambodia when he was only a few months old in 2002 and Brad, who started dating Angelina a few years later, adopted him in 2006.  The couple also have children Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight together and all six children were onboard the flight when the row broke out.

"P!nk Hands 12 -Year-Old Superfan the Mic at Her Concert & Is Blown Away: Watch  Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist's song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink's concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the ""Beautiful Trauma"" singer: ""when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,"" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show.

Anthony belted out a flawless solo version of Pink's hit ""Perfect,"" drawing a roaring applause from the crowd and a stunned response from the singer. Judging by her reaction, it's safe to assume Pink thought Anthony was pretty ""perfect"" herself.  ""Thank you for that,"" the still-amazed Pink said after returning onstage.

"Grey’s Anatomy star Caterina Scorsone has opened up about her character Amelia Shepherd and revealed she will have lighter experiences going forward!  On the latest episode, Shepherd had a massive tumor removed from her brain and is on the road to recovery. Scorsone revealed that she thinks this trauma will allow Amelia to have a new perspective on life and start a new chapter. “I think, obviously, things are looking up for Amelia. They can’t get much more down,” Scorsone shared.  “I know that this whole season, there’s been the emphasis on bringing some of the lighthearted humor back, infusing it into the show in the way that we had it a little earlier on… When Amelia was on Private Practice her voice was really quite comedic and humorous. I think that again, now that we’ve gotten through this very tragic story line, I’m anticipating and I’m starting to see there’s a lot of lightness in store.”  Aside from the tumor, Scorsone also commented on her character’s on-and-off relationship with Owen. “People are complicated and relationships are complicated,” she explained matter-of-factly. “There’s so much love and there’s so much that they’ve shared, and yet there’s so much trauma and hurt and there’s just so much to wade through in terms of what was real and what wasn’t and what hurts and what was good.”  She added, “So I’m sure the feelings are not straightforward for the two of them.”  Grey’s Anatomy airs at 8 pm on Thursdays on ABC.",1
"Well that was quick! Within a week of reconnecting with Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are OVER! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she believes the Biebs is her true soulmate.  Jelena fans that hung in there for years after Justin Bieber, 23, and Selena Gomez, 25, many splits are finally getting their dream come true in the former couple reuniting. While the two are supposedly just in the stages of reconnecting their friendship, they just haven’t been able to stay away from each other in the past week. Sel even broke up with her boyfriend of 10 months, The Weeknd, 27. That’s because Selena feels she and Justin were always destined to be together. “No matter what happens, and where life goes, Selena’s heart always ends up coming back to Justin. They truly do love each other deeply, but despite multiple tries they’ve never been able to make it work, and they’ve always ended up splitting,” a source close to Selena tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “Selena believes they’re destined to be together though, and that Justin is her soulmate, but they just met each other at too young an age to be able to make a go of it,” our insider continues. They were just teenagers when Jelena made things official way back in 2011. In the years since they worked hard to transition into being successful adult artists and are now two of the biggest singers on the planet! But it took a toll on their romance plans as it would for any young stars.  “They still have those deep intense feelings for each other — they don’t just dissolve because they split — so, inevitably they end up agreeing to try to give it just one more try,” our source continues. The two were photographed having breakfast at a vegan restaurant outside of LA on Oct. 29, the third time in a week that they have been spotted hanging out after not seeing each other for at least the past year and a half. See Jelena’s most couples goal moments in pics, here.  A second source tells us Selena has big hopes for the couple now that they’ve reconnected, especially after her dramatic kidney transplant over the summer. “Selena has always hoped that Justin would be the one she would marry. She has the biggest weakness for Justin, the first true love of her life. Selena’s health scare put her whole life into a new perspective and she has reevaluated having a family, getting married and everything else in her life,” our insider tells us. “She has always wanted everything out of life and now time is more precious than ever before. She is learning now to seize the day and take action on things. If she wants a happy ending with Justin, she needs to make it happen now.”  HollywoodLifers, when do you think Justin and Selena will confirm they’re back together?",0
"Brad Pitt.  Noted sculptor Brad Pitt is famously single — and apparently fighting off gangs of thirsty women everywhere he goes. So it should come as no surprise that sometimes the baggy-pants aficionado chooses to go incognito with the ladies by using a different name. Or should we say, his real name.  As Wikipedia confirms, Brad Pitt was actually born William Bradley Pitt. And wouldn’t you know, according to “Page Six,” dear ol’ Brad recently introduced himself as William when chatting with a lady at Coffee Commissary in Los Angeles.  Pitt reportedly showed up on his motorcycle, wearing “sunglasses, jeans and a leather jacket” (how cool), and sparked up a conversation with a woman in line who “looked a little like Kate Bosworth, but it wasn’t her.” Per “Page Six”:  When the woman said, “I’m Lydia,” Pitt “put out his hand and said, ‘Hi, I’m William.’ She replied, ‘Oh, you look like a Bradley.’ And he responded, ‘Well, that’s my middle name’ and smiled and winked at her.”  As Lydia exited she said, “‘Nice to meet you, Bradley . . . I mean William.’ He laughed to himself, then got on his bike.”  Sounds a lot like another William we know.",1
"The scandal surrounding Bachelor in Paradise isn't over yet.  The lawyer for contestant Corinne Olympios, who was at the center of the alleged misconduct that led to production being suspended on the ABC reality series, is speaking out hours after producer Warner Bros. announced that it had closed its internal investigation into the claim and that production on the current fourth season would resume.  ""It needs to be made crystal clear that production of Bachelor in Paradise was shut down because of multiple complaints received from BIP producers and crewmembers on the set. It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone,"" Olympios' lawyer, Martin Singer, said in a statement. ""It comes as no surprise that Warner Bros., as a result of its own internal investigation, would state that no wrongdoing had occurred. Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.""  Early Tuesday, Warner Bros. TV announced that production would resume on the current fourth season of the spinoff after an internal investigation found no evidence of the alleged misconduct that was first reported on June 11. ""We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a castmember. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any castmember was ever in jeopardy,"" Warner Bros. said in a statement.  Despite the delay in production, ABC confirmed that Bachelor in Paradise would air this summer as planned. ""We appreciate the swift and complete investigation by Warner Bros. into allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise,"" a network spokesperson said in a statement. ""Given their results, the series will resume production, and will air this summer on ABC.""  Shortly after announcing the cast for this summer's season on June 6, Warner Bros. halted production to investigate a misconduct incident on the Sayulita, Mexico, set. A producer filed a complaint over an alleged sexual encounter between two contestants who had been drinking, Olympios and DeMario Jackson. It remains unclear if the producer witnessed the incident or had seen the footage, though sources tell The Hollywood Reporter Olympios was ""lucid"" and ""conversational"" on the tape. Still, since alcohol was involved, there was a question of whether one or both parties may have been too intoxicated to give consent.  The season four castmates were sent back to the U.S. the same day Warner Bros. announced the investigation, with most arriving home by June 12. When the cast was told to pack their bags, they were informed that they ""might"" return. It remains unclear if either Jackson or Olympios will return to continue filming.  Both Olympios and Jackson lawyered up in the days following the production suspension, with Olympios retaining top Hollywood litigator Singer and Jackson hiring L.A.-based attorney Walter Mosley.  Olympios issued her first and so far only statement about the matter on June 14. ""I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4,"" she said at the time. ""Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production.  ""As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.""  While many of those associated with the show, including series creator Mike Fleiss, host Chris Harrison and several of the contestants from the current season celebrated Warner Bros.' decision to resume filming, other insiders are questioning the move after Bachelor in Paradise appeared all but destined for cancellation in recent days following fallout from the scandal.  As part of its lengthy statement Tuesday, Warner Bros. said it plans to ""implement changes to the show's policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.""  It also remains unclear what will happen to the tape of the alleged incident at the center of the investigation, which Warner Bros. said Tuesday it does not plan to release ""out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved."" That videotape could be a key piece of evidence in Singer's ongoing investigation into what transpired.  Before being selected for Bachelor in Paradise, Olympios appeared on season 21 of The Bachelor, where she competed for Nick Viall's affections. She placed fourth.",1

"Rachel Brosnahan is sharing fond memories of her late aunt, Kate Spade.  On Wednesday, the star of the Amazon series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel paid tribute to the influential designer, née Katherine Noel Brosnahan, who was found dead at 55 from apparent suicide in her N.Y.C. apartment one day prior. Brosnahan shared a video of Kate dancing with her husband Andy Spade (brother of actor David Spade) with a big smile on her face as a mariachi band played in the background.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered,” wrote the 27-year-old actress. “She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent.”  She added, “Hug your loved ones extra tight today.”  After Brosnahan won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a television series, musical or comedy for her work in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in January, Kate told Page Six that the family was “insanely proud.”  “I am beside myself! My daughter and I jumped up and down when she won,” the beloved handbag creator said. “She deserves this recognition, as she’s put her heart and soul into the role. We are insanely proud.”  Kate Spade and Rachel Brosnahan Walter McBride/Getty  Police confirmed Kate was found Tuesday morning in her bedroom at her and Andy’s Park Avenue home in Manhattan. A housekeeper discovered her, according to a police source, and she left a suicide note.  RELATED: Kate Spade’s Groundbreaking Career: A Look Back at the Designer’s Most Major Milestones  “We are all devastated by today’s tragedy,” her family said in a statement to the New York Daily News. “We loved Kate dearly and will miss her terribly.

Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard,” wrote David.  “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on,” he added.

"According to reports, Ange’s new man – rapper and filmmaker praCh ly has been making secret visits to her Hollywood home, where he has bonded with the 42 year old’s son, Maddox and is even teaching the family about Buddism.    “Angelina and praCh have a special bond.

He can teach him about his homeland of Cambodia in a way he can relate to.”    Angelina and praCh, second from left.    “That’s because both Maddox and praCh were born in Camodia, but didn’t grow up there.”    Ange and paCh, 38 - who has been dubbed the “first Cambodian rap star” - were first introduced by mutual friend Loung Ung, the Cambodian-American activist who wrote the memoir First They Killed My Father, which Ange recently adapted into a film.

Despite experiencing their fair share of ups and downs, the A-list couple is in it for the long haul.  “When you see them together, there is no doubt about it.

"President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN’s Chris Cuomo looks like a “chained lunatic” on television. CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting” and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a “no-talent guy” who talks “filthy.”  Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.  “I’ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I’ve been able not to watch or read things that aren’t pleasant,” he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. “And it keeps you young.”  There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.  “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really dishonest,” he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. “You people are quite dishonest in all fairness.” He said he used to watch MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.  The one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.  Spokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president’s criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, “His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.” Trump’s claims about CNN’s Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  Here’s an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:  For instance I don’t watch CNN. I don’t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don’t do interviews and stuff and want to … He went the other way. Which is fine. He’s got some problems. But I don’t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don’t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I’m watching Fox. But they’re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don’t mean they – if I do something wrong. But it’s really, honestly it’s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he’s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He’s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who’s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it’s like – sometimes they’ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they’ll start screaming, we’re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I’ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They’re all doing well because of me. But it’s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It’s just bad. It’s an ability I never thought I’d have. I never thought I’d have the ability to say, they’re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won’t watch it. And it’s amazing, it doesn’t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They’re really dishonest. I mean they’re really dishonest.  Trump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert’s blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:",0

"Slow your roll ‘Baywatch’ fans. Alexandra Daddario is squashing claims that she’s loved up with costar Zac Efron.  Alexandra Daddario, 32, wants to make something very clear: She’s not dating Zac Efron. Yes, he was her love interest in the 2017 Baywatch film but the actress claims that, in real life, they’re just “good friends.” Alexandra clarified their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE. Crushing the hopes of Baywatch fans everywhere, she said on May 31, “We’re very good friends. Zac and I’ve worked together, and we’re very good friends.”  It’s not the first time that Alexandra has claimed that Zac, 30, is in the friendship zone. In May 2017, she told E! News, “We work together closely; he’s my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.” So, what happened? Alexandra’s comments don’t match what HollywoodLife and other outlets have been told about the status of her relationship with Zac. In April a source EXCLUSIVELY told us that the actress has been “very coy” about their rumored romance. The person added, “But people that are close to her know that this a defense mechanism because she really wants it to work and doesn’t want anything to get in the way of a great love match. She wants to make it look like she is single in public but is 100 percent all about Zac and the relationship they are brewing.”  If we take Alexandra at her word, she and Zac have definitely – at the very least – formed their own mutual admiration society. On March 16, he posted a tribute to the actress on his Instagram page. Next to a photo of them together, he wished her a “Happy Birthday” calling her the, “most real, down to earth, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving and most rare Pokemon ever created.” And on April 4, when Alexandra posted a photo of her looking at her dog on Instagram, he commented, “Two hot b*tches.” Because, with flirting like that, of course people wouldn’t think they’re dating.

"Jason Bateman received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday, with a speech by none other than his frequent co-star and friend Jennifer Aniston.  While people were expecting Bateman's Arrested Development co-star Will Arnett to supply some laughs during his speech, many weren't expecting the amount of friendly roasting Aniston provided.  Up Next: Was the Entire 'Friends' Series Just a Dream in Rachel's Head? As E! reports, she started out going through Bateman's oft-forgotten child star beginnings, which included roles in Little House on the Prairie and The Hogan Family. She also roasted his first film role in Teen Wolf Too by showing off a Muppets Magazine cover featuring the young star.  ""One thing has proven itself to be true and that is having longevity in this business is not easy,"" Aniston said. ""Especially starting out as a child actor. Usually that's a story that doesn't always end well. When I actually met Jason it was kind of looking like it could go either way."" More: 'Ozark' Showrunner Reveals How Long He Thinks the Series Should Last  She also shared a humorous story about a New Year's ski trip she attended with Bateman that featured the Ozark star nearly crashing his car. ""Picture this: It's New Year's Eve. It's just after midnight and there is a blizzard outside. I hear someone yell, 'Help! Someone Help! Jason. Car. Someone could die.'"" Aniston recalled. ""So we run outside to help him and what we see is, we have two feet of snow, Jason is in a truck fishtailing away down a one-way street hanging with the door wide open, hanging half way out of the car. ""His foot was out trying to stop the car kind of like Fred Flintstone. It's still not clear what you were doing, a little foggy right? You don't remember. Thankfully he outgrew those days of terrifying people.""",1
"The Kardashian-Simpson feedback loop continues. According to Inside Edition, O.J. Simpson—who is up for parole this October after serving the first nine years of a 33-year prison sentence on 12 charges, including kidnapping and armed robbery—has received comparatively cushy treatment while incarcerated. He has even found a new favorite show. You may have heard of it: Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  A former prison guard told the newsmagazine that Simpson “likes Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” More specifically: “He likes to keep up with all the gossip with them.”  Last year, The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story illuminated the ties between the Simpson family and the Kardashian clan for casual fans who may not have been aware of their connection—largely helped by David Schwimmer’s “Juice!”-y performance as the late Kardashian patriarch, Robert. Robert, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian, was one of Simpson’s best friends; his first wife (and the mother of his children), Kris, was very close with the slain Nicole Brown Simpson. (Regrettably, Simpson has not seen American Crime Story, reports Inside Edition, “because the prison doesn’t get the FX network.”)  At the time A.C.S. was airing, Kim Kardashian West told GQ that she “loved” the FX drama. She also revealed that she had gone through the Louis Vuitton bag that was presented as evidence during Simpson’s murder trial—only to find it empty. Amusingly enough, Simpson was not quite as enthusiastic about the Kardashian-starring E! reality show—at least, not at first.  In O.J.: Made in America, memorabilia dealer Thomas Riccio—who was involved in the fiasco that landed Simpson in prison—said that K.U.W.T.K. was playing in the background as Simpson and company planned their ill-fated confrontation. Simpson, Riccio said, spotted the show and said, “That’s my goddaughter. Her name is Kim!” Then he added, “That show ain’t going to last two weeks.”  Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe",0
"Though the singer surrounds herself with LGBTQ friends and collaborators, she wasn't always so inclusive: ""When I was growing up, homosexuality was synonymous with the word abomination … and hell.""  Katy Perry's conservative Christian past is no secret, but the pop superstar took a trip down memory lane on Saturday night (March 18) while dropping some new truths in the process of detailing her journey to enlightenment.  The reason: Human Rights Campaign's Los Angeles gala dinner at JW Marriott L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles, where Perry picked up the org's highest honor, the National Equality Award. HRC feted the 32-year-old alongside America Ferrera, 32, who took home the Ally for Equality Award, a trophy presented to her by her good friend Lena Dunham. Perry received her award from her own BFF of 11 years, actress Shannon Woodward, who said the singer ""finds a way to act as an ally virtually every single time she performs or speaks publicly.""  BFF of 11 ys @shannonwoodward presents to @katyperry, lauding her as global pop star who created soundtrack to our lives #HRCLADinner @HRC pic.twitter.com/6f36zHaNrQ — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) March 19, 2017  For Saturday's edition, Perry first praised her LGBTQ friends for informing her own evolution. ""There’s no other community that has done more to shape who I am today, and there is no other community that I believe in more than you,"" she exclaimed. ""This community here tonight has achieved more progress toward a more perfect union in a short amount of time as any group in our history. So I stand with you and I know that we stand together against discrimination, whether it be in the LGBTQ community or our Latino brothers and sisters or the millions of Muslims in this country.""  Then came Perry's peek at the past. After noting that she speaks her truths and paints her fantasies courtesy of ""little, bite-sized pop songs,"" she referenced her 2008 smash hit single ""I Kissed a Girl."" The lesbian lyrics were just a tease.  ""Truth be told: A) I did more than that,"" Perry purred. ""But B) How was I going to reconcile that with the gospel singing girl raised in youth groups that [was] pro-conversion camps? What I did know is that I was curious, and even then, I knew that sexuality wasn’t as black and white as this dress."" (For the record, she was wearing a Rasario design.)  However, Perry's own curiosity seemed to have gotten repressed by her Christian leanings. ""My first words were 'mama' and 'dada,' 'God' and 'Satan,'"" she related. ""Right and wrong were taught to me on felt boards and, of course, through the glamorous Jan Crouch crying diamond teardrops every night on that Vaseline-TBN television screen. When I was growing up, homosexuality was synonymous with the word 'abomination' … and hell. A place of gnashing of teeth, continual burning of skin and probably Mike Pence’s ultimate guest list for a barbecue. No way, no way. I wanted the pearly gates and unlimited fro-yo toppings.""  As a result of the anti-homosexuality education she received, Perry turned toward prayer.  ""Most of my unconscious adolescence, I prayed the gay away at my Jesus camps,"" she revealed. ""But then in the middle of it all, in a twist of events, I found my gift, and my gift introduced me to people outside of my bubble. My bubble started to burst.""  The ""pop"" happened with the introduction of LGBTQ friends and collaborators.  ""These people were nothing like I had been taught to fear,"" Perry continued. ""They were the most free, strong, kind and inclusive people I have ever met. They stimulated my mind and they filled my heart with joy, and they freaking danced all the while doing it. These people are actually magic, and they are magic because they are living their truth. Oh, my goodness, what a revelation! — and not the last chapter of the Bible.""  One of those magic people in Perry's life is her longtime manager, ""Bradford Elton Cobb III,"" a man she described as ""one of the greatest champions of my life,"" for going on 15 years. ""Many of the people I admire and trust and work with belong to the LGBTQ community, and without them, I would be half the person I am today. My life is rich in every capacity because of them. They are trusted allies that provide a safe space to fall, to not know it all and to make mistakes,"" she concluded at the close of her speech, which was bookended by standing ovations. ""I hope I stand here as evidence for all that it doesn’t matter where you come from, it is about where you are going. Real change, real evolution and real perception shift can happen if we open our minds and soften our hearts. People can change — believe me.""

"The latest development in the push to express strength among women and solidarity in the wake of the #MeToo movement comes in the form of a classic symbol: a white rose.  White has long been associated with the fight for women’s equality, going back to the days of the suffragettes. Now attendees of the 2018 Grammy Awards are mobilizing to wear white roses to the ceremony as a way of recognizing the ongoing cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse occurring across several industries, including entertainment.  Industry marketer Meg Harkins and promoter Karen Rait came up with the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, at a dinner where they and other music industry insiders brainstormed ways to ensure that the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements were acknowledged at the Grammys, just like they were at the Golden Globes.  After they had chosen the white rose — which they settled on as a symbol of peace, hope, and resistance — they began to spread the word by way of a mass email from Atlantic Records chair Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who’ve confirmed they’ll be wearing white roses to the Grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rita Ora, among others on a list that reportedly numbers in the hundreds.  When informed of the movement during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grammys host James Corden immediately voiced support and said he’d be wearing one as well.  Harkins and Rait told Billboard they were working to coordinate their messaging with the leaders of the Time’s Up campaign, which has been generally viewed as a leveling-up of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time’s Up also doubles as a legal fund for anyone fighting sexual harassment.  The push to extend the conversation around the movement into the Grammys is significant; so far, despite prominent actors like Casey Affleck and James Franco coming under scrutiny in the wake of a wave of sexual assault allegations throughout Hollywood, there’s been little similar pushback against prominent members of the music industry.  A few, like mogul Russell Simmons, have experienced repercussions after allegations against them. But others, like musicians R. Kelly and Chris Brown, continue to maintain successful careers despite ongoing controversy surrounding accusations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against them.  The organizers of the plan to wear white roses to the Grammys are all too aware of this dichotomy. “We have not had the tsunami [in the music industry] that politics and Hollywood has had,” Harkins told the Associated Press on Wednesday, “but we are still women.”  The effort to extend #MeToo and Time’s Up into the music industry comes at a moment when the latter campaign is already drawing backlash for expanding its reach outside of Hollywood, even though it’s not even a month old; the campaign has been criticized for not remaining narrowly focused on Hollywood reform. But the fact that in just a few days, hundreds of women in the music industry have vowed to show solidarity with Time’s Up at the Grammys indicates that, if anything, an expansion of the movement’s reach is still desired by many.  Ensuring that the conversation remains galvanized around the Grammys, then, will be an important task for the rose wearers. Corden told the Hollywood Reporter that the topic will be a major part of the awards show — most visibly through a prominent performance by Kesha intended to spotlight the #MeToo movement.  Kesha has become an inadvertent leader in conversations about how to reform the music industry to keep sexual predators from being structurally protected, due to her long fight to win contractual and financial independence from her alleged rapist and former manager, the producer Dr. Luke. Her struggle speaks to the ongoing need for conversations around abuse and assault in the music industry as well as to the growing call for change.  “We all agreed it was really necessary,” Harkins told the AP. “We’ve all felt the political and cultural change in the last couple of months.”  Still, the Grammys are already receiving criticism for not doing more to center the ceremony on such a glaring issue. Whether or not the red carpet is full of white roses, all eyes will be on the men and women of the music industry to see what comes next.",1

"Jax and Brittany are taking Versailles. Vanderpump Rules stars Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor have booked their wedding venue, and the location is one fans should’ve seen coming 2,000 miles away. Brittany has said time and time again that she has always wanted to get married at the Kentucky Castle in Versailles, Kentucky, and what do you know? That is precisely where she and Jax will tie the knot. As Jax shared on Instagram on Thursday, Brittany’s dreams of getting married at the Sexy Unique Spot are officially coming true. And whew, the IG video of Jax and Brittany's wedding venue sure is something to behold.  “Well venue set, deposit paid,” Jax wrote on IG. “Now I need a drink....bad.” He also posted a video to Instagram Stories he took while he and Brittany celebrated the financial commitment they just made. ""Just got the total of the wedding!!!"" he wrote on the Story. ""Gonna need more tequila!!""  Once the sticker shock wore off, Jax let his excitement take the reins. He tweeted on Friday,  “Can’t believe I am getting married in a castle that is all ours for three nights.. you can’t see the amazing pool in the back but it’s absolutely gorgeous. Gonna be a weekend to remember! #thekentuckycastle”  Without further ado, please enjoy this video of a reality star who just booked the wedding venue of her dreams.  What at thrilling SUR-lwind the last few months have been. Jax and Brittany got engaged on June 7, and the couple immediately began plotting their wedding. Just a few weeks after the proposal happened, Jax and Brittany revealed they'd begun drafting their guest list, hired two wedding planners, started working with a wedding publicist, and attempted to figure out who would be in their wedding party.  When speaking with People back in July, Brittany revealed that the process of picking her bridesmaids was really putting her through it. She said,  “I have so many really close friends, from home in Kentucky and here in L.A., so making my bridesmaid choices down to like eight [people] is going to be really hard for me because my list is at like 15 right now. So, that’s going to be the hardest thing.”  While tasks like finalizing the guest list and the wedding party have been tough, choosing the wedding location was a breeze. As Brittany explained in the aforementioned People interview,  “I’ve known where I wanted to get married since I was a little kid. I’ve talked about it on the show. Even in other seasons, I wanted to get married at the Kentucky Castle so I don’t think that’s a surprise.""  She always knew it was going to be the Kentucky Castle. We fans knew it was going to be the Kentucky Castle. And now, Jax and Brittany's wallets know it's going to be the Kentucky Castle.  Speaking of dreams, if the Bravo cameras are not part of Jax and Brittany's castle wedding day, it will be a true nightmare. Come on, the Jason ""Jax Taylor"" Cauchi is getting married. In a castle.

"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Meghan Markle‘s dad is having a change in heart.  The 73-year-old announced Tuesday that he was going to try and walk his daughter down the aisle, despite his staged photo controversy — but was then forced to walk the statement back after learning from doctors that he needed heart surgery.  “They will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,” Thomas Markle told TMZ.  The former television lighting director has been recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which left him with a “seriously damaged” heart. Thomas was reportedly back in the hospital on Tuesday undergoing a series of tests.  He had come forward on Monday and said he wasn’t going to be a part of Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials because he didn’t want to embarrass her following the paparazzi photo controversy. But Thomas reportedly slept on it and changed his mind Tuesday morning.  “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle,” he told TMZ. “This is a historic moment.”  While Thomas initially thought the surgery wouldn’t complicate things, he said he now realizes how hard it would be to make the trip across the Pond.  In response to her father not making it, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released a statement late Monday saying: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas told TMZ that his daughter called him on Monday, but he missed the call. She reportedly texted him and said she loved him, was concerned about his health, and didn’t blame him for the staged photos.  The Daily Mail revealed Sunday that Thomas secretly collaborated with a paparazzi agency to set up the pics, which showed him reading stories about his daughter’s wedding and getting fitted for a suit.  Sources told The Post that he was “set up” by the LA-based company, identified as the Coleman-Rayner News Picture Agency.  They apparently took pics of Thomas drinking and entering a fleabag hotel — and threatened to release them if he didn’t agree to pose for them.  “They told him if he posed, they wouldn’t put out the other pictures,” a source explained. “They told him they’d make him look good. They also gave him a few bucks for his trouble.”  Coleman-Rayner did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment about the alleged setup.  While Queen Elizabeth II was reportedly “very angry” about the photo controversy, Thomas told TMZ he didn’t think she really cared at all.  “I don’t think the queen is thinking about what I’m doing,” he said.",1
"Mexican telenovela actor William Levy currently leads a fascinating family life with his longtime girlfriend and kids, but despite being seen as an inspiration for fathers and lovers, the Cuidado con el angel star has his own dark history.  William previously cheated on his wife-like partner multiple times and currently repents on his previous acts, but he still seems unable to make a lifetime commitment to his lover.  Cheated On Longtime Girlfriend; Secretly Dating Mexican Actresses  William's relationship with his model-girlfriend Elizabeth Gutiérrez goes way back to 2003. Crossing more than a decade together, the couple is currently the parents to two adorable kids; a son named Christoper and a daughter, Kailey.  You May Also Like:- Cree Summer Gushes Over Keeper Husband - Kids Are Add-Ons To Happiness  Considering their longtime dating, William and his wife-like-girlfriend are content with their relationship and children; however, this has not always been the case since William allegedly cheated on his girlfriend multiple times.  William, along with partner Elizabeth and children, Christopher and Kailey in May 2018 (Photo: William Levy's Instagram)  It was September 2014 when Ximena Navarrete, William's co-star from the Mexican telenovela La Tempestad, revealed that the two were secretly dating.  Ximena reportedly confessed her relationship to some of her closest friends and mentioned that she was madly in love with William. The revelation followed the rumors of the Mexican actor cheating on his longtime partner that initiated after the photos of him and Ximena hanging out in a Miami hotel surfaced the media.  Following the incident, Elizabeth broke up with her boyfriend in December 2014.  Although the pair didn't reveal the reason for their split, it was apparent that the trigger was William's adultery. The couple eventually got back together and resumed their romance until 2017 when another incident of William's past infidelity was disclosed.  But, that was hardly the end of William's cheating incident!  Earlier in 2017, Mexican actress Jacqueline Bracamonte revealed that she had an affair with William after the starred together in a soap opera in 2009. She mentioned that William had lied to her about breaking up with Elizabeth and said that he was single at the time.  Jacqueline added that once she found out that her partner was in a relationship and had even fathered a child, she immediately broke up with him.  Even though Elizabeth was shocked with her boyfriend's infidelity, she didn't break up with him as it was a thing of the past and William had vowed never to commit these transgressions again.  A Happy Family Of Four  Currently, William is a total family man dedicating all his time and energy with his girlfriend and children.  The sweet family of four often plans different activities together. Back in August 2017, William's children and partner showed their unconditional love for him when they prepared a surprise birthday party for William. Similarly, William also adores his kids and have flaunted his love for them through social media on several occasions.  His first-born, Christopher is a prolific baseball player and may even take up a career in the sport.  On 6 March 2017, William shared an Instagram post in which he mentioned that Christopher had won a baseball championship playing for a local team named Clutch Miami and even expressed his concerns as a proud father.  Similarly, William's daughter, Kailey is the apple of his eye whom he considers to be his everything. On 6 March 2018, he posted a picture of his youngest kid and wished Kailey for her birthday.  William Levy's daughter Kailey in 2018 (Photo: William Levy's Instagram)  William shares a loving relationship with Elizabeth, but the two have not mentioned their intention of getting married. Although he proposed to her several years before in 2013 on Christmas Eve, the pair has not talked about their plans to getting married in the recent times.  This has left many many wondering if William ever intends to make Elizabeth his wife. With some even accusing him of secretly being gay due to his lack of commitment.  Open For Gay Roles; Gay In Real Life?  William, who is often called the ""Cuban Brad Pitt,"" revealed in a 2014 interview with Fox News Latino that he had grown tired of being portrayed as the muscular hunk and wanted to do some serious acting.  He even mentioned that he was open to playing gay roles if the character was profound and inspirational. When asked if he would perform as a gay man in a movie, William answered,  ""I'll have to see. I'm not against that — not at all. But, it'll ultimately be up to the script and whether the character shows a depth of emotion and is inspirational.""  However, this doesn't mean that he is gay in real life. It would be absurd even to think that the who cheated on his partner with multiple women, would be secretly a gay man hiding in the closet.",1
"Robert Pattinson is NOT over his ex-fiancee FKA Twigs, and we’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why he still thinks about her.  Ladies, it’s time to take notes! The best way to get back at an ex-boyfriend is to look amazing. FKA Twigs, 30, latest Apple commercial (promoting the HomePod) has her ex-lover Robert Pattison, 31, reminiscing about the good old days. “He loves her very much still and seeing this commercial reminds him of how amazing she is. He sees her talent, he sees her smile, and watching it makes him happy since it such a time warp for him. It takes him back to when they were in a better place. It shows the best of everything about her. Now, will that lead him back to her? Never say never,” a source close to the Twilight star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. So sweet, right?  For those of you who haven’t seen the commercial, Robert isn’t exaggerating. FKA looks absolutely stunning in the ad directed by Spike Jones. In the four-minute clip, the gorgeous singer shows off her enticing dance moves to the tune of “Till It’s Over” by Anderson .Paak. The HomePod transforms her room into a dance floor, and we can’t get enough. No wonder Robert is so smitten. FKA’s commercial also marks her return to the spotlight. Since their breakup in 2017, FKA has kept a pretty low profile, and hasn’t put out any music. So, this is definitely the Friday pick-me-up we didn’t know we needed. Plus, just like Robert, we can’t help but take a trip down memory lane.  Robert and FKA were together for a little two years before deciding to call it quits. We certainly thought they were in it for the long hall as they had plans to get married. Unfortunately, their busy schedules caused them to breakup. Interestingly, right after their split, a source told The Sun, “with so much history between them, though, there are strong feelings there.” And, it’s clear those strong feelings are still alive today. Don’t be surprised if they reunite in the near future! We’d be here for it.",0

They didn't want the campaign to be all about their relationship.  9 August, 2016. Tom finally admits it's 2016, and joins Instagram. His first photo is of him dressed up as Thor baddie, Loki sans Taylor. Shame.  11 August, 2016. Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield take the piss out of Hiddleswift, and, well, lol.  #willofield 😂😉 A post shared by Phillip Schofield (@schofe) on Aug 10, 2016 at 6:17am PDT  14 August, 2016. Tom speaks to the media about going out with Taylor aggggggaaaaaaiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn: ""I've learned that there are many sides to a story, and that sometimes there are a lot of stories out there which are false and the hardest thing is to try to not let those falsehoods affect your own life, that's what I would say,"" he tells The Hollywood Reporter.  25 August, 2016. Taylor and Tom have their first fight… *gasp*. Us Weekly says their first ""major argument"" stemmed from his filming schedule for Thor: Ragnarok in Australia. Tom reportedly tries to patch things up by flying to Rhode Island to see Taylor for a ""quick two-day stay."" Publicly, the two have not been spotted together since their trip to Australia in July.  6 September, 2016. It's reported that Taylor's worried Tom's not with her for the right reasons. According to an insider at DailyMail.com, Taylor feels super ""uncomfortable"" over Tom's desire to be ""so public"" with their romance, and so isn't sure whether she's keen to parade it down the Emmys red carpet on 18th September.  7 September, 2016. Hiddleswift is O-V-E-R according to a number of publications. Us Weekly's sources say the publicity is what caused the relationship's demise. ""Tom wanted the relationship to be more public than she was comfortable with. Taylor knew the backlash that comes with public displays of affection but Tom didn't listen to her concerns when she brought them up.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  8 September, 2016. Despite what we first thought, Tom's friends insist it was in fact Tom who did the dumping and not Taylor. Interesting.  10 November, 2017: Taylor releases her much-anticipated album Reputation, and fans think there's a song on there about Taylor using Tom to leave Calvin.  The lyrics include: ""The ties were black / the lies were white / I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason. You were driving the getaway car, we were flying but we'd never get far / But with three of us, honey, it's a side show and a circus ain't a love story and now we're both sorry.""  Remember the video footage of Tom and Taylor dancing together at the Met Gala 2016? Well that would explain the ""ties were black"" bit. And fans believe that 'Getaway Car' could be a metaphor for Tom helping her to escape her relationship with Calvin, which links to the 'I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason'.  Bit of a bummer for everyone involved...  Follow Anna on Twitter.",0
"Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.

"According to People, Los Angeles hairstylist Amber Maynard Bolt of Nine Zero One Salon spearheaded her hair makeover and used Joico Blonde Life products. She told the publication that the singer “had not done a change in a while and wanted something different.” We feel you, Demi, those curtain bangs are calling our name.  But the transition from brown to blonde wasn’t an easy one. As Maynard Bolt told Allure, the process took two days and two stylists to complete. Yikes. On the plus side, the celebrity colorist says they binge-watched Netflix and noshed on healthy food made by Lovato’s chef throughout the endeavor, so it probably wasn’t that arduous.

My principal screamed into the microphone Wait a minute did he say Nicki Minaj?! My idol, the one I love so much?? I can't believe she's here. She walked on the stage and everyone got up and screamed some even cried. I just sat there like yeah Nicki Minaj great.. I was trying to play it cool. see the trick is when you meet someone famous you have to play cool that's the only way to get notice trust me. my mom Livi works for a couple famous people. She started talking and answering questions and she sung a verse of pills and potions!!!! My friends looking at me like I'm crazy because they know I'm in love with her. As she was picking someone so she could ask a question her eyes landed on me. I mean I am sitting down while everyone else is standing, but we made eye contact and it felt weird like I actually knew her or something. I shook it off and looked away. I looked back and she was telling my principal something and they looked at me. Searching for something to do I looked at my teacher and mouthed ""May I use the restroom?"" She said sure and I scurried out of the gym.",0
"Wendy Williams is taking time off from her self-titled show to focus on her hyperthyroidism and Graves’ disease.  The talk show host, 53, announced on Wednesday’s show that she was diagnosed with Graves’, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid, in addition to thyroid issues of which she was previously aware.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Graves’ disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,” she explained, adding that it has made her eyeballs twitch.  Williams admitted that her viewers spotted the eye issue before she did, adding that she attributed symptoms to focusing on her son Kevin‘s senior year of high school and applying to colleges as well as her work.  Wendy Williams Courtesy Wendy Williams Show  “Wendy is a true champion and has never missed a day of work. But her health and well-being must be put before all else,” a show rep tells PEOPLE. “Wendy has been openly dealing with her Graves’ Disease for many years in addition to hyperthyroidism. Yesterday, Wendy’s doctor prescribed a necessary three weeks of rest to get her levels and medication in sync. The show will be in repeats during this unplanned hiatus. A live show was produced today so that Wendy could speak directly to her fans and explain her condition.”  After canceling an appointment with her endocrinologist scheduled for December in favor of a business meeting, Williams finally saw the doctor on Tuesday.  “My doctor has prescribed — are you ready? — as of today, three weeks of vacation,” she announced. “What? Who are you? I was pissed.”  The TV personality joked, “I’ll be back in two. I’m not an heiress — who is going to pay my bills? Are you serious? I’m just saying, I come from working class.”  Williams also had an important message to women to put their health first.  “What I want to say to women, more than men, is stop putting everyone first because if we’re not good, they’re not good,” she said.  The announcement comes after Williams canceled several shows last week because she was experiencing “flu-ish” symptoms, she said in an Instagram post last Wednesday.  “I do go to the doctors today to find out what exactly it is,” she explained. “I feel awful. I had to be talked out of going to work today and taking off a few days to get myself together.”  The talk show host also fainted during a live broadcast of her show on Halloween, which she attributed to feeling “overheated” in her elaborate Statue of Liberty costume. The broadcast quickly cut to commercial, and Williams continued the show when they returned.  The day after the incident, Williams recounted the collapse to her studio audience.  “It was scary,” she recalled, choking up. “It was really scary. It was so scary, all I could think of in the middle of the scare was, ‘Don’t pull the podium over on you, because that’ll make it worse.’ ”  After closing out the show, paramedics informed her she was low on electrolytes.  “My blood pressure was fine, my heart rate was fine, everything was fine,” she said. “I’m a 53-year-old middle-aged woman going through what middle-aged women go through, if you know what I mean. The costume got hot. Right before passing out, I felt like I was in the middle of a campfire.”  The Wendy Williams Show airs weekdays (check local listings).",1

"It's most definitely not turning out to be a white Christmas for Jennifer Lopez, 48, and Alex Rodriguez, 42, this year!  But, who needs snow to get in the spirit when you have a hunky baseball-playing boyfriend lounging shirtless in the pool at the sprawling mansion you share over the holidays?  The power couple is clearly having a very hot, hot Christmas, celebrating together in sunny Miami.  ""So, this is what Christmas Eve in Miami is like, huh?"" Jennifer asked her beau in an Instagram video she shared on Dec. 24. ""I'll take it!""  A large, lavishly set table can be seen in the background, presumably for Christmas Eve dinner, with enough place settings to accomodate their whole blended family.  After all, Jennifer has 9-year-old twins, Max and Emme, from her marriage to Marc Anthony and Alex has two daughters, Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9.  But, even with all of those kiddos running around, Jennifer and Alex still seem to make time to do things one-on-one, like working out together.  ""We gotta do yoga tomorrow,"" she said to Alex while opening a box of new leggings by the Christmas tree in another Instagram video posted on Dec. 23.  Still, at the end of the day, it's all about family for these two.  ""I always think about my daughters,"" Alex gushed in a sweet holiday-inspired video he posted to Instagram on Dec. 24. ""I just want them to be happy. Happy kids with high self-esteem.""  It's clear that these Hollywood lovebirds have their priorities in the right place this Christmas.  Happy holidays!",1

"“I never had the empathy for people who lacked confidence. I had so much of it that I didn’t know what it was like to be without it.” He added: “It was incredible because it was forced humility. Previously, I would’ve looked at humility as more of a negative thing.” But that humility, he said, “gave me time to grow.”  On opioids, medication and liposuction  “I was drugged out,” Mr. West said on TMZ, about the period preceding his hospitalization. “I was on opioids. Two days after I got off of opioids, I’m errrrrr — I’m in the hospital.” He said he had been prescribed the pills after undergoing a liposuction procedure. “I had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for y’all,” he told the staff of the gossip outlet. “Didn’t want y’all to call me fat, so I got liposuction. And they gave me opioids.”  Mr. West said he went from taking two pills a day after the surgery to taking seven, but that he was no longer on as much medication. “These pills that they want me to take three of a day, I take one a week maybe, two a week. Y’all had me scared of myself, of my vision. So I took some pills so I wouldn’t go to the hospital and prove everyone right. We are drugged out! We are following other people’s opinions. We are controlled by the media. And today it all changes.”  On racism  Mr. West began a diatribe on race by citing new lyrics. “I got this rap that says: Parents are the strippers/strip they kids of their confidence/teach white dominance/question your common sense/I’ve been washed in tradition, now I’mma rinse/hopped off the Amistad and made ‘I’m a God.’”  He went on to explain that the conversation about putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill “was the moment that I wanted to use Bitcoin,” adding: “It’s like when you see all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don’t you show us — put Michael Jordan on a $20 bill.”  In reference to Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X, he added: “Man, I know this is going to cause an uproar, but certain icons are just too far in the past and not relatable and that’s what makes them safe.”",0
"Suri Cruise has begged her famous father Tom, “Daddy, come home!”  RadarOnline.com exclusively learned their strained relationship could be repaired after she implored him to visit her, a source said.  Suri, 12, whose mom is Tom’s ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes, 39, has been contacting her dad through a series of heartbreaking letters, calls and voicemails, the insider has revealed.  PHOTOS: Aircraft Simulator & Spy Towers: Tom Cruise Builds His OWN Scientology Lair  Although Katie’s rep has denied it, according to the source, the little girl has begged Tom, 56, to come and visit and the Mission Impossible star has finally responded to Suri.  “He’s contacted Suri through a third party, who he trusts implicitly, to check in and make sure she’s okay,” the spy said. “He wants her to know that he’s thought of her all this time and that he got all of her messages. In fact, he read and listened to each and every word.  “Tom’s paving the way to come back into Suri’s life permanently—and many expect it to happen soon.”  PHOTOS: Tom Cruise Through The Years  In June 2012, Holmes ended her marriage to Tom and things have reportedly been hard between him and Suri ever since.  A second source said of Tom, “He was absent for one milestone after another” in Suri’s life.  Although Holmes is constantly photographed with her daughter, fans have wondered why Tom is so rarely seen with Suri.  PHOTOS: Packing On The Pounds? Tom Cruise UNRECOGNIZABLE In New Photos  “That would be painful for any child—you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it [took] on Suri,” the source said.  The Church of Scientology requires members to “disconnect” with those who leave the controversial faith and “Tom couldn’t reach out [to Suri] before because Katie fled the religion,” the source said.  Tom, a top celebrity in Scientology, “believes he can bypass the rigid rule.”  The superstar is building a home base in Florida to help build up Church membership, “but what he’s really doing is setting the stage for a reunion with Suri,” the insider explained.  PHOTOS: Tom Cruise’s 21-Year-Old DJ Son Spinning Out Of Control — CAUGHT Cavorting With Semi-Clad Women  Suri has “made a plea to Katie to let her see her dad,” and Katie, who recently denied that she has split from longtime boyfriend Jamie Foxx, is all for it.  “Katie would never stand in the way of Suri having a relationship with her father. If that’s what Tom wants, the better.”  The source added that Tom “feels like he’s missed out so much. He wants her to be a part of his life.”  We pay for juicy info!

"Entourage and Wisdom of the Crowd star Jeremy Piven has issued a statement strongly denying TV personality/actress Ariane Bellamar’s public accusations that the Emmy-winning actor groped her on the set of Entourage and at the Playboy Mansion several years ago.  “I unequivocally deny the appalling allegations being peddled about me. It did not happen,” Piven said in the statement to Deadline. “It takes a great deal of courage for victims to come forward with their histories, and my hope is that the allegations about me that didn’t happen, do not detract from stories that should be heard.”  Bellamar’s October 30 claims on Twitter quickly were picked up by mainstream media on Tuesday, prompting CBS, the network that airs Piven’s Wisdom of the Crowd, and HBO, which carried Entourage, to issue statements.  “We are aware of the media reports and are looking into the matter,” a CBS spokesperson said Tuesday.  Said HBO today: “Today, via the press reports, is the first we are hearing about Ariane Bellamar’s allegations concerning Jeremy Piven. Everyone at HBO and our productions is aware that zero tolerance for sexual harassment is our policy. Anyone experiencing an unsafe working environment has several avenues for making complaints that we take very seriously.”  Here is the trio of tweets by Bellamar about Piven and his alleged unwelcomed interactions with her, that triggered the response:  Hey @jeremypiven! ‘Member when you cornered me in your trailer on the #Entourage set? ‘Member grabbing my boobies on the 🛋 without asking?? — Ariane Bellamar (@ArianeBellamar) October 30, 2017  ‘Member when I tried to leave; you grabbed me by the ass, looked at yourself in the mirror, & said what a ‘beautiful couple’ we made? #MeToo https://t.co/liD7irs0o0 — Ariane Bellamar (@ArianeBellamar) October 30, 2017",1

"A MAN marrying a stranger on a reality TV show was so disappointed by his new wife's appearance that he muttered ""oh s**t"" the moment she appeared at the top of the aisle.  Aussie Sean D, 38, was saying I Do to a total stranger on Married At First Sight, a programme that sees total strangers meeting at the altar after being paired up for life by a team of scientists and psychologists.  Channel 9 6 Sean D muttered ""oh s**t"" when he first locked eyes on his new bride  But while single mum Jo, 39, was thrilled with her new hubby - later exclaiming ""Jackpot! I've won the lotto!"" - he had a face like thunder for the entire ceremony and the reception.  Things even took a further dive when after kissing his new missus, he wiped her lipstick off his mouth and said ""gross"".  Speaking to The Fix, Sean shared the criteria he had given producers for his dream partner.  He said: ""Someone who’s funny. Someone’s who loyal. Someone who wants to have good fun. Having someone to go and have fun with and do different things and learn different things. And someone who's trustworthy.""  Channel 9 6 He was unable to hide his disappointment, although he was matched with someone who was 100% his type on paper  Channel 9 6 Jo was delighted to see her hunky new husband and said she felt like she had won the lottery  But despite Jo ticking all the boxes, he simply didn't fancy her.  Sadly for Jo, she really did think she had struck gold with her mystery man.  At the wedding she said: ""He's got kind eyes. He seems genuine. I fancy him.  ""This could work. My expectations have been met and then some. To infinity and beyond... Sean D and Jo sitting in a tree.  Channel 9 6 Jo couldn't stop talking about how good looking her new man was  ""My expectations have been met, and then some. To infinity and beyond. Winning! Jackpot! I've won the lotto!  ""The experts have been spot on! He is for me. He couldn't be any more perfect.""  But Sean felt very differently, which made for awkward viewing for people at home.  He said, ""Um, she's probably not what I imagined, no.  Channel 9 6 Later Sean looked despondently at the table as Jo stared at him adoringly  ""There's not like a massive spark straight away, but I'm sure she's feeling the same way.""  People tuned in at home were on the edge of their seats as the mismatched pair continued to totally misread one another's body language and reactions to each other.  All I really wanna watch is Jo & that sad sack Sean #MAFS — DeluxeStormBorn™ (@deluxe_tm) January 31, 2018  However, Sean has since explained his frosty reaction to likeable Jo - it's all because of his exercise addict ex-girlfriend who he's still a bit hung up on.  He said that after she got addicted to exercise, their 10 year relationship ended and he was stuck caring for their plethora of pets including llamas and cats - and he is still traumatised and tired.  Sean said: ""We had a five-acre property together, and she ran out of time for me and the animals.  Channel 9 6 Sean later described kissing his wife as ""gross""  ""It was really hard because I had to take responsibility of the farm. I got all the animals. When we broke up, we had nine dogs, two alpacas, and two horses.  ""It was difficult breaking up, it wasn't like either of us did anything wrong - there was no cheating or anything like that.  ""She became a fitness freak but was just crazy. We slowly drifted apart and that was it, we were done.""

"Blake Shelton (L) and Gwen Stefani attend the 2016 Pre-Grammy Gala and Salute to Industry Icons honoring Irving Azoff at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on Feb. 14, 2016 in Beverly Hills, Calif.  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton have been going strong for years now.

With heavy hearts, they announced, ""We are real people, with real lives, with real families, friends and colleagues. Therefore, we kindly ask for privacy and compassion concerning this very personal matter.""  August 2015: Gwen Splits From Gavin Rossdale  After 13 years together, the rocker couple ended their marriage soon after Shelton and Lambert. Their joint statement read, ""While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment.""  September 2015: Another Sweet Selfie  The pair lean on each other during mutual hard times, relating through the struggle of divorce.  --Gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Oct 20, 2016 at 2:07pm PDT  October 2015: Clearly Chemistry  Stefani and Shelton appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and perform a duet rendition of Drake's ""Hotline Bling."" The performance is packed with chemistry and perhaps some tension in Gwen's voice on the lyric ""late night when you need my love.""  Later that month, the are-they-or-aren't-they couple are reportedly spotted at George Clooney's Halloween celebration before heading over to Jared Leto's. A source told E!

They ended the song hand in hand.  June 2016: Blake Opens Up to Billboard  Shelton opened up about heartbreak and new love in his cover-story interview, revealing, “Gwen saved my life. Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  September 2016: Rumors Arise  Ellen asks Gwen point blank about wedding plans, and the smitten singer simply giggles along saying, ""I'll let you know.""  Feb 2017: Gwen Gushes Over All Things Blake  On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Gwen talks about Shelton's love of the woods and all things camo, plus taking him to Disneyland. She gushes through the entire interview, and it's cute.  October 2017: Adam Levine Weighs In  Levine told Howard Stern the couple was “so in love it's disgusting.” The Maroon 5 singer added, “It's so funny. They found each other at really interesting times in their lives. It's really beautiful. Because it's in the public eye, a lot of people want to have their own bullshit opinions about it, but I'm, like, there. I see it every day. I have a pretty unique perspective on it, and it's real, man.""  November 2017: Blake Shelton Crowned People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive.  After her beau earned the Sexiest Man Alive title, Stefani told Ellen, “He doesn’t even like to do a photo shoot. You can never convince him to do it. So he just called me like, ‘They want me to do this.’ And I was like, ‘You should totally do it! You’re so sexy!’”  December 2017: Holiday Cheer  The couple unites for a cheerful performance of their duet ""You Make It Feel Like Christmas."" They stare into each other's eyes and look so in love, it hurts.  April 2018: More Wedding Rumors  Gwen sits down with Ellen and admits that she thinks about getting married all the time. Hint-hint, Blake.  June 2018: Supportive BF  Before kicking off her Las Vegas residency, Shelton caught his girlfriend rehearsing, and shouted her praises on Twitter.

July 2018: 'Super In Love'  In an interview with In Style, Gwen admits that her look is more feminine than ever before. She adds, ""It’s probably because I’m super in love and have a really manly man [Blake Shelton]. I enjoy letting that part of me come out.""",0
"ABC's Grey's Anatomy firefighter-focused spinoff finally has a title.  The Shondaland drama will be called Station 19, executive producer Paris Barclay announced Thursday as part of a social media campaign for the show. The title comes from the name of the firehouse at the center of the story.  The 10-episode spinoff, picked up straight to series, is set in Seattle and focuses on firefighters from the captain down the ranks to the newest recruit in their personal and professional lives. The castmembers are expected to be introduced in an episode of the flagship series this season. The firefighter series will be the second spinoff to come out of Grey's Anatomy following Kate Walsh starrer Private Practice. The latter ran for six seasons and wrapped its run in 2013.  From Shonda Rhimes and her Shondaland partner Betsy Beers, Station 19 is penned by Grey's Anatomy alum Stacy McKee, who serves as showrunner. She also exec produces the ABC Studios drama, alongside producing director Barclay. Grey's star Ellen Pompeo recently added a co-exec producer credit on the spinoff as well.  Jaina Lee Ortiz (Rosewood) leads a cast that includes Grey's Anatomy regular Jason George, who will segue to the spinoff this season; Grey Damon (Friday Night Lights); Miguel Sandoval (Bad Judge); Okieriete Onaodowan (Hamilton); Danielle Savre (Too Close to Home); Jay Hayden (The Catch); Barrett Doss (Iron Fist); and Alberto Frezza (Dead of Summer).  Delays in show titles are not uncommon; Grey's Anatomy did not have a title right away, while Scandal was not that show's original name, either.  As for what to expect from the spinoff, McKee said it exists in the same universe as Grey's — the joke is that Fire Station 19 is three blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. The showrunner called the spinoff ""Grey's adjacent"" and said there was ""a lot of potential for cross-pollination,"" noting that they would be excited to have crossover with the characters or places from the flagship in ""small ways or big ways.""  Station 19 premieres March 22 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.",1

"Ben Affleck made his arrival into the Big Apple looking comfortable in a pair of jeans, grey T-shirt and navy blue jacket on Saturday.  This comes after his rep denied to DailyMail.com that he was engaged to Lindsay Shookus.  On Wednesday Life & Style claimed the couple, who have been dating for six months, are making plans to walk down the aisle. 'He's fallen hard,' an insider told the publication. 'It's no surprise that they're now taking their relationship to the next level.'  Scroll down for video  New York state of mind: Ben Affleck arrived into the Big Apple on Saturday  Not Lindsay: The Justice League actor was spotted with an unidentified woman at the airport, but it is believed he is in town to see his rumored fiance  Shookus, a TV producer for Saturday Night Live, has yet to be seen with an engagement ring on her wedding finger.  But the magazine has pointed out that has been seen wearing a diamond ring on her right hand and this could be an engagement ring.  Even though he was accompanied by an unidentified woman, he is more than likely in town to see his lady love, 37, who lives in the metropolitan city.  Happy days: Ben and Lindsay have been dating publicly for six months; seen in November  Affleck often flies to Manhattan to spend time with the blonde beauty.  Ben has yet to finalize his divorce from Jennifer Garner, with whom he has three children: Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.  Lindsay's divorce from Late Night With Seth Meyers producer Kevin Miller has also not been finalized.  The former couple, who met when they were both working on SNL, are parents to a four-year-old daughter.  Not final: His divorce to Jennifer Garner has yet to be finalized; seen in April  'He's a huge romantic at heart and isn't one to wait around when it comes to getting married,' the L&S source continued.  'Ben is the happiest he's ever been. He knows Lindsay is ""the one,"" and the feeling is mutual.'  The couple has reportedly been spotted house hunting near New York's Central Park and the Brentwood area of Los Angeles where he and Garner shared a home.",0
"A Timeline of Harry Styles & James Corden's 'Late Late Show' Bromance  James Corden and Harry Styles have one big thing in common: They’ve both crossed the Atlantic to take America by storm. On Tuesday night (Dec. 12) -- when Corden and his wife Jules were a little busy welcoming their new baby girl -- Styles helped his fellow Brit out by taking over hosting duties on The Late Late Show last-minute.  “Donald Trump finally got sick of James’s jokes and deported him back to England,” Styles quipped at the top of the show. Actually, Corden and his wife were at the hospital, and Styles shared some scoop about their new addition. “She looks a lot like James, mainly because James looks like a giant baby,” he joked.  Styles also addressed the kiss heard 'round the world: the one shared between him and Corden on Monday night’s holiday Carpool Karaoke. “I would like to take the opportunity to announce that we will also be having a baby,” he joked.  All jokes aside, Styles clearly has Corden's back. So where did this adorable bromance begin? Billboard put together a timeline of their past Late Late Show shenanigans.  May 14, 2015: One Direction goes to battle with Corden in a game of dodgeball. “It definitely feels like the last five years I’ve been in this band has been in preparation for this game,” Styles deadpans.  Corden talks to the quartet about Zayn’s departure from the group. When the host asks if they thought of adding another member like him, Styles flat-out says, “No.”  May 15, 2015: One Direction talk about life on the road, and Styles reveals that he went on a juice cleanse. “I actually had all the side effects that you read out,” he tells Corden.  Dec. 4, 2015: The four members of One Direction play a game of Tattoo Roulette with Corden, where they all pick from boxes and the loser (or winner) has to get a tattoo commemorating the occasion. Styles went under the needle, getting a memento of The Late Late Show permanently inked on his arm.  Dec. 15, 2015: As a member of One Direction, Styles sits in the back while the quartet sings Carpool Karaoke versions of their songs “What Makes You Beautiful,” “Best Song Ever” and “Story of My Life.”  May 15, 2017: Kicking off the show’s week with Styles, the singer appears on the show’s Flinch segment with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, in which he wears a red apron and holds a teacup behind the glass shield. He manages not to spill any of his tea.  May 16, 2017: The singer delivers some zingers about Russian collusion news in his first Late Late Show monologue. “The good news for Trump is he has been named Employee of the Month by Russia,” he jokes.  May 17, 2017: Styles and Corden star in a sketch where they play doctors who break into song during a surgery.  May 19, 2017: This episode marks Styles’ first appearance on Carpool Karaoke without his One Direction mates. His biggest takeaway from his first solo adventure in shotgun? “I feel like I have more control over the buttons.” There’s a fun scene where they magically change clothes into argyle and a skin-tight gold number, confirming what we already knew: The singer can pull off any style.  June 8, 2017: Styles storms the Late Late Show set to… answer a wrong number.  Dec. 11, 2017: Corden’s yuletide segment of Carpool Karaoke features a smattering of A-list celebrities, including Fifth Harmony, Katy Perry and Foo Fighters, singing “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town.” But it's his kiss with Styles that made headlines.",0
"“Grey’s Anatomy” stars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew are leaving the ABC drama, Variety has confirmed. The two actors will depart at the end of the show’s current and 14th season.  “The characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey’s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,” said executive producer Krista Vernof. “As writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.”  “It’s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.”  Capshaw and Drew’s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season. Rhimes last year signed an overall deal with Netflix worth $100 million, that takes her away from her longtime home at ABC Studios, which produces “Grey’s Anatomy.”  Deadline first reported the departures.",1

"Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter.  We're pretty sure there's nothing that Amal Clooney can't do, and do beautifully.  Like, say, wearing a pants-and-dress combo to walk the red carpet at Monday's annual Metropolitan Museum of Art Gala. Clooney and her husband George were our favorite couple from the evening, and she stunned in a shiny floral print strapless gown with a long flowing train and trousers.  Amal Clooney at the 2018 Met Gala on May 7, wowing everyone. But she wasn't done yet. Getty Images  But as we learned from Vogue editor Anna Wintour on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Amal wasn't done stunning us for the evening.  ""She wore this incredible dress on the red carpet that was designed by a young British designer called Richard Quinn but it was made of tin foil, so she was a little bit concerned it might rip during the evening,"" Wintour revealed.  Fortunately, the human rights lawyer had backup.  ""She went into the gift shop and she changed into this extraordinary Tom Ford dress, which is designed to look like stained glass,"" Wintour continued.  And it was a stunner as well: a full-length fitted mosaic maroon gown with matching red accessories, including Christian Louboutin heels. She sat at the table next to Rihanna, who took our breath away in her beaded gown.  Amal Clooney (with husband George) in her second Met Gala dress, a red Tom Ford creation that evoked stained glass. Backgrid  ""You sell this at the gift shop?"" Colbert wondered incredulously. ""I thought it was just astronaut ice cream and paperweights.""  Apparently not. As Wintour noted, there's just one way you can get away with doing that.  ""Only if you're Amal Clooney,"" she said.  Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter.",0

"The state of Michigan is quickly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the past 8 years. Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:“Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers’ noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here’s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet…all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid’s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit. Other Muslim defendants include:Mashiyat Rashid, of Oakland County – controlled, owned or operated Global Quality, Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians, Tri-State Physicians, New Center Medical, National Laboratories, and Tri-County Wellness;Yasser Mozeb, of Oakland County – allegedly received payments from Global Quality and Tri-County Wellness;Abdul Haq, of Washtenaw County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians and Tri-State Physicians;Joseph Betro, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians and New Center Medical;Tariz Omar, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.Mohammed Zahoor, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.Trump’s Justice Department isn’t messing around, as the defendants are being brought up on a plethora of federal charges, including five counts of health care fraud and health care fraud conspiracy. Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashid’s companies’ fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country.We must continue to sound the alarm about what’s going right underneath our noses. This isn’t the first time that Muslims have ripped off Americans with fraud, and with the hordes of migrants that liberals keep fighting to bring into our country, stories like this will sadly become the new norm if the American people do not wake the hell up soon!",0

"On March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers.  Once the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS’ helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper — and away from the public eye — Melania dropped the act. And Donald’s hand. “Melania,” a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, “does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.”  That includes the presi­dent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model — who’s currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC’s Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year — refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. “They have separate bedrooms,” says another Trump insider. “They never spend the night together — ever.” (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: “It’s very ‘royal’ of them!”)  Upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, “Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,” explains the family source. “She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him.” A rep for Melania denies the claims, telling Us, “It’s unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed ‘sources’ that have provided fictional accounts.”  Since assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn’t set foot in the nation’s capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly.  Melania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister’s wife, around Palm Beach in February, but “only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,” according to the family source. “She refused to do it in Washington.”  For much more on the Trumps, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

"Rachel Brosnahan returned to the red carpet for the Tony Awards on Sunday, June 10, days after her aunt Kate Spade died at the age of 55.  The Marvelous Miss Maisel actress, 27, stepped out in a pink floral Dolce & Gabbana gown for the star-studded event at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. After posing for photos, she’d later introduce the performance of The Band’s Visit.  Spade died by suicide on June 5. She was found dead in her New York City apartment at about 10:20 a.m. by her housekeeper. Brosnahan’s father is the brother of the late designer.  11 PHOTOS Rachel Brosnahan at the 2018 Tony Awards See Gallery Rachel Brosnahan at the 2018 Tony Awards NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 10: Rachel Brosnahan attends the 72nd Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 10, 2018 in New York City.

She was the kindest person I’ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already,” he said in a statement. “Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy.”  He continued: “There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.”  The pair, who married in 1994, are the parents of daughter Frances Beatrix, now 13. They were separated at the time of Kate’s death.  Like Brosnahan, Andy’s brother David Spade has returned to the public eye since the tragedy. On June 8, he said during a stand-up performance that it had been a “rough week” but he didn’t want to cancel the show.  68 PHOTOS Tony Awards 2018: Red carpet arrivals See Gallery Tony Awards 2018: Red carpet arrivals NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 10: Todd Spiewak and Jim Parsons attend the 72nd Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 10, 2018 in New York City.

"The secret’s out! Brad Pitt has a new woman in his life: Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Neri Oxman.  “Brad’s absolutely smitten by her,” a Pitt source reveals exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly. “Their chemistry is off the charts.”  Since last fall, Hollywood’s most eligible bachelor, 54, has been quietly dating the award-winning architectural designer, 42, after admiring a line of her 3D-printed chaise lounges at MIT, where she teaches media arts and sciences at the Massachusetts school’s Media Lab. Oxman is the first person to whom Pitt has been linked since his headline-making split from Angelina Jolie in September 2016.  “They got romantically involved almost right away,” the insider tells Us. “He’s been going to great lengths to make sure he’s not spotted by prying eyes.”  Still, that hasn’t stopped Pitt and Oxman from taking secret trips. “Brad and Neri have traveled together internationally on several occasions,” the source reveals, noting that the new couple went to the Design Indaba conference in South Africa in February. (The professor was a featured speaker at the event.)  Though a second Pitt source claims “this is solely a professional relationship [and] there’s nothing more to it as of now,” the first insider calls that story a cover-up: “They are very much a couple.” Page Six was first to report news of their romance.  Meanwhile, the actor-director and Jolie, 42, are still working out the details of their divorce settlement. A source told Us in February that the parents of Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9, are trying to keep the case “private and they want things to be amicable.”  For more on Pitt and Oxman’s romance, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands Wednesday, April 11!

"For the season finale of ""Hollywood Medium,"" psychic Tyler Henry connected with the granddaddy of all spirits: Michael Jackson.  The medium met with La Toya Jackson for the reading, where the musician's untimely death in 2009 was the main topic of conversation for all parties involved.  ""I have had a reading before, and I'm not always a believer,"" Jackson admitted before the reading. ""Because you don't know if they're reading you form information the know or not. I cannot wait to see what he tells me.""  Even before Henry learned who he'd be doing a reading for, he was getting vibes from the other side, with references to a furry bird sitting on someone's shoulder and someone's premature passing on his way to La Toya's home. Once he found out she was his client for the day, Henry admitted, ""I'm in shock. Today, I was so starstruck, I had to consciously calm myself down, which is normally something I don't have to do.""  Before getting to Michael, Henry told La Toya he could sense tension in her neck and throat area, something she confirmed. ""You're right, sometimes my mouth get locked and I can't close it and the tension is always here,"" she explained.  ""There's a lot there. I don't even know where to start. There was a funny joke about someone having a cockatoo,"" Henry said as the reading went on. ""We had one growing up,"" she confirmed. Henry then said he felt someone come through on his drive over, before admitted his did know, ""to some extent,"" how La Toya's brother died.  ""When he came through, I had to focus on every message exactly as he was delivering it. I couldn't make any guesses, I couldn't have any assumptions, I had to make sure that I was communicating exactly what he was showing me so I wasn't biased with what I already knew about the case,"" he explained in a confessional.  ""He's having me acknowledge that when it came to his passing and anyone around right before or right after, there's a feeling of someone's story changing. Someone saying I saw him go through this, this happened and then their story changes abruptly after. There's a very strong emphasis on this,"" Henry told La Toya. ""He's acknowledging that he should not have been left alone at a time when he was left alone. And that's coming in and that's what he's putting a lot of emphasis on. The person who should have been there to monitor wasn't monitoring and it's like, I trusted you to be there, I trusted the role that you were supposed to have to help me and you left. Of all times, you should be right here.""  ""Did something happen when he was abandoned?"" asked La Toya.  ""It's interesting thing with this. I feel like, when he was abandoned, that would have been an ideal time for him to reach 911, to call for help, to try to get help,"" he continued. ""At this time he realized something was wrong while he was alone and that's when he was conscious and realizing something's wrong here. I just don't feel like he had someone to say hey, I'm having a medical emergency, something's happening. So after I realize, ok there's something wrong going on in here, there's this feeling of oh this medication kicks in. I suddenly become affected by this medicine. And this happens very fast.""  ""I think what hurts more than anything else is that not only was there a need for someone to be there for him, but there was a trusted person, a person that he trusted, a person that was in that inner circle and that person wasn't there,"" La Toya said after hearing this. ""To hear that, it tears you apart. I wanted to just cry.""  Michael Jackson passed away at the age of 50 in 2009 after an overdose of propofol. Murray's lawyers tried to argue that Jackson self-administered the drug when Murray was out of the room, but a jury found him negligible and guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Murray spent two years behind bars.  ""Do you know if his story changed? Did he say one thing and then say something different?"" Henry asked La Toya. ""Yeah, stories changed. They change all the time."" When Henry asked if she knew whether his doctor left the room, she added, ""He did admit that at one point, that he did.""  ""I don't see anyone coming into his room while he was alone,"" Tyler added.  ""You definitely gave me validation there. I think everyone wants to know really, what truly happened, because none of us knew, there were different stories,"" La Toya responded. ""The stories changed and we wanted to know what the truth is and you've brought closure. We all have the same question, even his children. Thank you for that, I appreciate that.""  ""There has been so much confusion with that really took place and what happened,"" she continued. ""Whether someone else had come into the room or not was one of the major questions, because that was something that was always spoken. Every member in my family wants to know ... he clarified that.""  She then asked if our loved ones are ""our guardian angels sometimes,"" with Henry saying Michael came through as the type of spirit who would totally flicker the lights to let you know he's there. ""I do know that after he passed, the lights were flickering off and on and I would say, Michael, 'Is that you? Mike, is that you?'""",1
"Good news, DC Comics fans. The first look at Aquaman super-villain Black Manta is a pretty faithful adaptation of the comics.  The upcoming blockbuster, which Warner Bros bosses are already promising will set the DCEU back on the right path, has unveiled three new images ahead of the film's launch later this year.  The first of which is The Greatest Showman and The Handmaid's Tale actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane, a bounty and treasure hunter who uses the alias Black Manta.  Director James Wan describes the live-action version of Black Manta as ""part mercenary but full-time pirate"", which is a pretty spot-on description of the comics version of the character.  Wan also clarifies that although Black Manta has a key role to play in Aquaman, the key conflict will be between Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson).  ""Black Manta is a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,"" he teased.  EW also premiered alternate covers for its upcoming issue that include the first glimpse of Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, the former Queen of Atlantis and mother of Aquaman's bride Mera (Amber Heard), before sharing three stills from the film too.  In this magazine profile, James Wan teases that his underwater world will include a gritty recreation of the infamous Super Friends scene of Aquaman riding a seahorse, juxtaposed with cannibal trench-dwellers, sea dragons and a giant octopus.  ""The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it's like I'm making my own sci-fi fantasy film,"" Wan said. ""This is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.""  Aquaman is released in cinemas on December 14.  Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

"Diagnosis  There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.  Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors — can also cause facial muscle weakness, mimicking Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:  Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.  This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.  Treatment  Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.  Medications  Commonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.  such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.  Physical therapy  Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.  Surgery  In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.  Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems.  Lifestyle and home remedies  Home treatment may include:  Protecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.

Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.  Alternative medicine  Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine for people with Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following:  Acupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief.

Write down questions you want to ask your doctor.  Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For Bell's palsy, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:  What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?  Are there any other possible causes for my symptoms?  What kinds of tests do I need?  Is this condition likely temporary or long lasting?  What treatments are available for Bell's palsy? Which do you recommend?  Are there alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?  I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?  Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?  Don't hesitate to ask any additional questions that occur to you during your appointment.  What to expect from your doctor  Be prepared to answer questions from your doctor, such as:  When did you begin having symptoms?  Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?  How severe are your symptoms?  What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?  What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?  Have any of your relatives ever had Bell's palsy or problems with facial paralysis?  Have you had any symptoms of a more generalized infection?  What you can do in the meantime  If you have facial pain:  Take over-the-counter pain relievers. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can help with pain.

Since the twins arrived the notoriously private couple have kept a lot of their new family life under wraps, apart from a couple of sweet shots on social media.  But on Tuesday night the 42-year-old singer spoke about his twins for the first time and opened up in a gushing on stage speech in Budapest.  ""I love them so much""  “I became a father about 12 weeks ago, and I can absolutely tell you, two things: Love my babies! I love them so much,” Enrique told the crowd.  “Actually, three things: I love my girl, and I super f*cking love you guys for being here tonight!” he continued.  The sweet moment was captured on video by a fan in the crowd.  It’s clear that the Escape singer is absolutely besotted with his children and adores his new life as a dad.  The couple shared the first photos of their twins earlier this year. Source: Instagram  Their sunshine  Enrique and Anna have been together for 16 years but are notoriously private when it comes to their relationship and are rarely seen together in public.  The couple officially confirmed that they had welcomed their son and daughter a month after they were born when they both took to social media to share sweet snaps of the bubs.  Both the singer and the former tennis ace captioned their posts: “My Sunshine.”  In 2017 there was a lot of speculation that the pair had tied the knot after Anna was seen sporting a large diamond ring and matching eternity band on her wedding finger.  But in an interview months later Enrique explained that despite the length of time they’d been together, the couple have no plans to get married.  The singer explained they already live the life of a married couple in a lot of ways.",1
"Talk about a True transformation! Khloé Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.  In a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a “combination of breastfeeding and being very active” for the impressive weight loss.  Mommy’s Little Love A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 26, 2018 at 2:13pm PDT  “After I had True, I didn’t put any pressure on myself to lose the baby weight,” Kardashian wrote. “I just wanted to get back to my regular routine from before I got pregnant, which was working out five to six times a week.”  Then Kardashian got down to specifics: “Here is where I am at currently. True turned 3 months old on July 12. I honestly didn’t give myself a number that I wanted to lose by this time, especially since I wasn’t able to work out for the first six weeks. But, since then, I’ve lost 33 pounds! I’m shocked that I lost that much weight that quickly. I’m chalking this up to the combination of breastfeeding and being very active during and after my pregnancy.”  Shortly after she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed True, the Good American founder resumed workouts with her trainer, Joel “Coach Joe” Bouraïma, and she recently slammed speculation she was on a “ridiculous” post-baby diet.  And in her latest post, Kardashian emphasized the role of exercise in her life while asserting that not all mothers need to be such gym devotees. “I never compare myself to other women as every woman has their own journey. We also all have different priorities in our day-to-day lives. One of mine is having that one hour where I can be selfish and alone in my place of refuge,” she wrote.  “Staying healthy and active is something that’s very important to me,” she added. “Exercise is something I’ve always used to maintain my sanity and relieve stress. And, now that I have a baby, I still want to keep something that’s my time, my space, something I’m doing for myself.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1

"The Saudi billionaire is uneasy that Breezy has the ability to take RiRi back, rumors claim.  Rihanna and Hassan Jameel made headlines in June 2017 when they were photographed making out in a pool at a private villa in Spain. Fans believed at first that the guy was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be a Saudi billionaire. He is the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the largest companies in the world. The Barbadian singer was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, 28, and it looks like her new beau fears that the “With You” singer might win her back.  A source close to Rihanna, 29, recently told Hollywood Life that Jameel is worried that Brown keeps “lurking in her past” and is being unpredictable. Although RiRi has opened up to her new beau about her past, the Toyota heir is still concerned that Breezy can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the “Kiss Kiss” singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime.  However, a separate source previously told the same news outlet that Rihanna hopes that the well-heeled Saudi Arabian can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown. Now, fans are convinced that she has moved on gracefully from Breezy. The “Umbrella” singer recently stepped out with her new flame Hassan Jameel at the Grammys despite keeping their relationship under wraps.  “He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.”  stay pressed.

"For other people named John Mahoney, see John Mahoney (disambiguation)  Charles John Mahoney (June 20, 1940 – February 4, 2018) was an English-American actor of stage, film, and television.  Born in Blackpool, England, Mahoney emigrated to the United States at the age of 18 and started his acting career on the stage in 1977, moving into film in 1980. He was best known for playing the blue-collar patriarch Martin Crane in the American sitcom Frasier, which aired on NBC from 1993 to 2004. In addition to his film and television work, Mahoney also worked as a voice actor and was particularly passionate about his stage work on Broadway and in Chicago theatre.  Early life [ edit ]  Mahoney was born in the Bispham area of Blackpool, England on June 20, 1940, the seventh of eight children. His paternal grandfather was Irish Catholic.[4][5]  The family had been evacuated to Blackpool from the Mahoneys' home city of Manchester, when it was heavily bombed during the Second World War. He started school at St Joseph's College, Blackpool. After the war, the family moved back to Manchester. Mahoney grew up in the Withington area of the city and discovered acting at the Stretford Children's Theatre. His father Reg was a baker[6] who played classical piano, and his mother Margaret (née Watson) was a housewife who loved reading. His parents' marriage was not happy and they either would not speak to each other or have heated arguments. The family situation, combined with the war, fueled Mahoney's interest in acting and he vowed to leave Manchester.[7][8]  Mahoney moved to the United States aged 18 in March 1959[9] when his older sister Vera, a war bride living in rural Illinois, agreed to sponsor him. He studied at Quincy University, Illinois, before joining the United States Army. After graduating from Quincy, he lived in Macomb, Illinois, earned his Master's degree in English [10]and taught English at Western Illinois University in the early 1970s,[11] before settling in Forest Park, Illinois, and later in Oak Park, Illinois. He became a US citizen in 1971[12] and served as editor of a medical journal through much of the 1970s.[11]  Career [ edit ]  Early work [ edit ]  Dissatisfied with his career, Mahoney took acting classes at St. Nicholas Theatre, which inspired him to resign from his day job and pursue acting full-time. After a stage production in Chicago in 1977, John Malkovich encouraged him to join the Steppenwolf Theatre.[13][14] He did so and went on to win the Clarence Derwent Award as Most Promising Male Newcomer. Gary Sinise said in an interview for Bomb Magazine that Lyle Kessler's play Orphans ""kicked John Mahoney, Kevin Anderson and Terry Kinney off into the movie business""[15] after their Steppenwolf performance of the play for which he won the Derwent Award and the Theatre World Award.[16] Mahoney won Broadway's Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves.[17]  Mahoney's first major film role was in the 1987 Barry Levinson film Tin Men. He went on to have prominent roles in a number of acclaimed films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, including Moonstruck, Eight Men Out, Say Anything..., In the Line of Fire, Reality Bites, and The American President.[17][18][11] He appeared in two Coen brothers films, Barton Fink[19] and The Hudsucker Proxy.[20]  Frasier [ edit ]  Mahoney appeared in Frasier from its debut in 1993 until the final episode in 2004; Mahoney received two Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations for the role of Martin Crane, the father of Frasier Crane and Niles Crane. NBC executives held Mahoney in such high esteem that Warren Littlefield declared he was pre-approved when the Frasier creative team suggested casting him as the father.[21] Prior to appearing on the series, Mahoney had appeared in an episode of Cheers – from which Frasier was a spin-off – as an inept jingle writer who has a brief conversation with Frasier. Mahoney also appeared as a priest in Becker, which starred Cheers star Ted Danson.  Voice acting [ edit ]  Mahoney voice acting on September 7, 2007  Mahoney's first voice job was in W. B. Yeats's ""The Words upon the Window-Pane"" for the award-winning National Radio Theater of Chicago. He provided the voices for several characters in Antz (1998), Preston Whitmore in Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Atlantis: Milo's Return, General Rogard in The Iron Giant (1999), and Papi in Kronk's New Groove (but was succeeded by Jeff Bennett in The Emperor's New School for an unknown reason). In 2007, Mahoney provided the voice of Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr. (Sideshow Bob's father) in The Simpsons episode ""Funeral for a Fiend."" This reunited him with his Frasier co-stars Kelsey Grammer (Sideshow Bob) and David Hyde Pierce (Cecil, Sideshow Bob's brother).  Post-Frasier [ edit ]  Mahoney co-starred as the Old Man in the Broadway revival of Prelude to a Kiss at the American Airlines Theater in a limited-run engagement running from previews on February 17, 2007, through to April 29, 2007.[22][23] He appeared as an elderly drag queen in the ER season 13 episode ""Somebody to Love,"" and co-starred with Steve Carell (himself a veteran of Chicago theatre) as the father of Carell's character in Dan in Real Life. In March 2008, he opened in the world premiere of Better Late at the Northlight Theatre.[24] He was also the narrator for Midwest Airlines commercials. Mahoney also made two appearances on USA's Burn Notice in the second (2009) and third (2010) season finales. His character, referred to only as ""Management,"" is a senior intelligence agency official who is the apparent main mover of the conspiracy which blacklisted Michael Westen.[25][26]  Mahoney joined the cast of In Treatment for the series' second season (2009) as a frenetic CEO who is overwhelmed by his personal and professional responsibilities and experiences chronic physical anxiety attacks. In 2010, he made a guest appearance on $#@! My Dad Says as homophobic retired naval officer Lt. Commander Wally Durham. Despite the numerous successes throughout his career, Mahoney has maintained that his early work in Lyle Kessler's play Orphans has ""affected people more than any other play I've ever done. I still get mail from it, I still get people stopping me on the street, and it's 20 years later.""[27]  Beginning in April 2011, Mahoney began rehearsing The Outgoing Tide, a new play by Bruce Graham at Northlight Theatre in Skokie, Illinois (suburban Chicago). The play also stars fellow Chicago actors Rondi Reed and Thom Cox. In 2011, he had two guest appearances on Hot in Cleveland as Roy, a waiter and a love interest for Betty White's character Elka.[28] This reunited him with his Frasier co-star Jane Leeves, as well as Wendie Malick whose character he eventually married in Frasier and his co-star in the movie The American President. Mahoney was a featured ensemble cast member in The Birthday Party, playing in Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre from January 24 to April 28, 2013.[29] Mahoney portrayed his last role in the play The Rembrandt, from September to November 2017.[30]  Personal life [ edit ]  Along with David Hyde Pierce, Mahoney was godfather to Frasier co-star Jane Leeves' son Finn.[31] Mahoney rarely spoke publicly about his private life,[7] but in a 2002 article he revealed he had been in several relationships, although he had never married, citing his parents' unhappy marriage as something he feared he would repeat.[8] He suffered from colon cancer in the mid-1980s and felt unable to have sex following a colostomy.[32] His Catholic faith was at the center of his life and work.[33][34]  Mahoney lived in Oak Park, Illinois.[8]  Death [ edit ]  Mahoney died in a Chicago hospice on February 4, 2018, of complications from throat cancer, originally diagnosed in 2014. He was 77 years old. According to his friend Anna Shapiro: ""He was fragile and he was supposed to be having a routine procedure. But having just beat Stage 3 throat cancer, I think he was just too weak… By the time he did The Rembrandt he was clean of cancer... But other health issues came up and he was just too fragile.""[35][36][37][38][39]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]",1
"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's marriage is just fine.  National Enquirer reported that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are already having some marital problems just a month after their royal wedding. The outlet published a report with a headline that read: ""The Honeymoon’s Over! Harry Storms Out On Meghan.""  The report claims that Prince Harry and Markle's marriage has ""hit the rocks following a blistering fight."" A so-called insider claimed that ""Harry and Meghan hadn't even had time to unpack from their honeymoon when tempers flared.""  The blame was put on Markle who reportedly wanted to shirk her royal responsibilities because she was supposedly pregnant. The tabloid added that her ""excitement turned to horror when she learned they could be at risk for contracting"" the Zika virus which is dangerous for expectant moms.  ""I'm told Meghan turned to Harry and announced, 'Of course, if the threat of Zika is still there in October, we will cancel the trip',"" the insider added.  The Duke reportedly blew up and yelled at his wife telling Markle that they will not cancel the trip no matter what. ""You're a member of the royal family now — if we commit to something, we do it!"" Prince Harry said.  According to Gossip Cop, however, the report is not reliable. The so-called insider constantly uses the words ""I'm told"" and ""I'm hearing"" which are telltale signs that the claims are illegitimate. In addition, no reputable publication picked up the same report that Markle is pregnant.  On the contrary, a source told Us Weekly that Prince Harry and Markle are not in a rush to have a baby since they have a lot of things on their plate.  ""Harry and Meghan won't rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They'll make fantastic parents,"" the insider said.  On Monday, Markle's dad appeared on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" and supports the claims that the royals want to start their own family soon. According to Thomas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex want to have kids.  Photo: Getty Images/Steve Parsons",0
"The feud continues between these frenemies.  Days after Kim Zolciak-Biermann was accused by fellow Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes of being a “racist,” the mother of six has obtained legal counsel, PEOPLE confirms. (A rep for Leakes had no comment.)  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “She put #KKK on the Instagram post. I’ve hired legal counsel at this point. It’s just that bad,” she told Larry King on Larry King Now Tuesday.  “It’s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,” said Zolciak-Biermann, who hasn’t seen Leakes since the feud ignited. “I’m on a show with all African-American women and I’m the only one that’s ever been on the show that’s Caucasian, so it’s the card that sometimes they play and it’s gross. And I won’t allow it.”  “I probably won’t shoot with her again,” she shared.  “I don’t take this lightly. It’s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,” Zolciak-Biermann, 39, told E!’s Daily Pop on Tuesday. “This is far beyond just having an opinion.”  The reality star’s decision to hire legal advisors comes on the heels of a public feud that involves herself, her 20-year-old daughter Brielle Biermann and Leakes.  On Thursday, Leakes, 49, slammed Brielle over claims of “prejudice” after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes’ home and allegedly found cockroaches. Leakes shared her response to an old video that showed Brielle in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.  In addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account.  “@briellebiermann We don’t have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p—-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f—ing with me and mine!” Leakes wrote in the comments section.  “Go somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn’t even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,” she concluded.  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Bierman Over Daughter’s Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar ‘Racist’  Also on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a “black roach.”  “I’m not calling BLACK people roaches! I found a roach in NENEs home! not calling her a roach dumb f—. doesn’t matter if you’re black, white, hispanic, asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u don’t f—ing clean ur s—!!! #callorkinpls,” the eldest Biermann child wrote.  Then, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo “racists.”  “Kim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,” Leakes wrote, adding, “children are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.”  Zolciak-Biermann told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.  “First off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM’s blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!” Zolciak-Biermann wrote on Instagram.  “Brielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,” Zolciak-Biermann concluded.  In a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.  “It’s so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that’s her last resort. (It’s convenient that I’m not racist when we are getting along.),” she said.  “In a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it’s heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she’s upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!”  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Returning to ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ for Season 10!  Later, Leakes responded to Zolciak-Biermann’s post with another statement of her own.  “Kim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim’s household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree’s plus 1. She is a huge lier,” Leakes wrote.  “All this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go! Then she turns around an try to get the fans on her side of this s— #trash.”  The Real Housewives of Atlanta premieres Nov. 5 (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.",1

"In Hollywood, they now talk about ‘‘the Lena Dunham effect’’ and ‘‘the Jill Soloway effect’’: Studios are starting to search for female-driven shows and recruit women to create them. In their ‘‘Odd Couple’’ trailers — one O.C.D. neat, one tousled — on different coasts, Dunham and Soloway have been plotting insurrection and nurturing female directors.  Studio heads may have no choice but to listen. As Kathleen Kennedy told me: ‘‘I had an agent pitching directors to me recently, and when he got done, I waited, and then I said, ‘So, do you represent any women?’ He said, ‘Oh, mmmmm.’ I had to bring it up. I think you’ve got to put pressure on them.’’ Tom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, recently told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘‘There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office. Maybe a decade ago or so that was true. I don’t find that true now at all. I actually think women drive the box office.’’ For the moment, it seems the bandwagon is rolling. ‘‘All of a sudden, we’re in this era of, ‘Oh, my God, girls,’ ’’ Pascal told me. ‘‘It’ll last about as long as it always does: about five more minutes.’’  Soloway has become a gleeful militant with a ‘‘messianic, feminist, patriarchy-toppling dream.’’ The mother of two sons, one a 7-year-old, she wants to put a nursery on her set and has been lobbying the D.G.A. to allow two directors per episode for more flex time.  The kids question is a significant one. Several top executives talk about the problem of female directors dropping out to have families. And there is still such an atmosphere of fear that many female directors told me they hide their pregnancies until the last possible minute. One director confessed that she actually hides her child, refusing to put a photo of her son on Facebook, fearing ‘‘it could end my career.’’  ‘‘I’ve even had women executives say to me, not realizing I was a mom, ‘We always want to work with women filmmakers, but then they have kids,’ ’’ says Marielle Heller, who also directed last summer’s critically acclaimed ‘‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl.’’ ‘‘It’s a real stigma, which I think is not fair. It’s crazy to me that that’s the excuse because nobody ever asks men who have kids whether they’ll be able to do it.’’  Over lemonade at Le Pain Quotidien on Melrose Avenue, Gina Prince-Bythewood, in gilt Wonder Woman kicks, said that when she was shooting ‘‘The Secret Life of Bees’’ in North Carolina, her husband back in L.A. told her that her younger son, now 11, was walking around the house with a toy phone having a pretend conversation with her. ‘‘I had a lot of guilt; it wrecked me,’’ said the 46-year-old, who also has a 14-year-old son. ‘‘But I’m a director, and I need to feed that part of me.’’  For nearly six months now, I’ve had the voices of Prince-Bythewood and many other talented women echoing in my head. I hear them puzzling about the disparity problem and dissecting it, trying to find a way around it or plotting to go head-on against it. Dunham talks about quotas. Others pin their hopes on web disruption with new studios at Netflix and Amazon.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But, as Prince-Bythewood says, the studios should open the door for women who are in love with film and with storytelling. ‘‘Just get us in the room,’’ she says.  Leigh Janiak is a 35-year-old with a laid-back manner, but you sense immediately that she knows where she’s going. Janiak pragmatically plotted her rise while she was a producer’s assistant for Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company. She refused an offer to direct an episode of a network TV show on the condition that she shadow a veteran director first. She was afraid it would stigmatize her.  ‘‘Why would anyone give me $40 million to get a movie off the ground if just last week I was doing this little training program?’’ she asked, over lunch at Little Dom’s in Los Feliz. She knew that guys who made horror and science-fiction movies could make the jump to blockbusters more easily than women who wrote rom-coms could. With her writing partner, she did a $1 million horror movie, ‘‘Honeymoon,’’ a goosebumps-inducing something-bad-happens-in-a-cabin-in-the-woods story (my favorite genre) starring the alluring redhead Rose Leslie, best known as Ygritte, the Wildling love interest of Kit Harington in ‘‘Game of Thrones.’’  That attracted the attention of the married producing team Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher, who tapped Janiak, raised Catholic and a former Ph.D. candidate in modern Jewish studies at the University of Chicago, to co-write and direct a remake of the cult horror movie ‘‘The Craft,’’ about witchcraft at a Catholic prep school.  She said she has no patience when she hears about female directors who melt into a puddle of tears after tangling with a grouchy cinematographer, saying: ‘‘I hear stories like that and think, If you are going to let people walk all over you, why do you even want to direct?’’  Fixing the gender problem in Hollywood is important for women like Janiak. But it’s also important for women and girls everywhere. ‘‘We are influencing culture, which is why it’s so dangerous, I think, not to have more women making movies,’’ she said. ‘‘Why can’t I direct ‘Superman’?’’",0
"The Dixie Chicks infamously faced a career-changing backlash after Natalie Maines slammed George W. Bush over the Iraq war during a concert in 2003. But in recent years, particularly with the growth of Twitter, it’s become extremely commonplace for artists to weigh in on current events. In fact, in addition to singers like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton, many celebrities use Twitter to rip Donald Trump on a daily basis.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 89403, ""name"": ""Miranda Lambert""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 89403, ""name"": ""Miranda Lambert"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 89416, ""name"": ""Carrie Underwood""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 33498, ""name"": ""Lady Antebellum""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 58018, ""name"": ""Blake Shelton""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 369639, ""name"": ""Jason Aldean""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 115096, ""name"": ""The Band Perry""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 34021, ""name"": ""Little Big Town""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 29083, ""name"": ""Luke Bryan""}], ""tagged"": false, ""type"": ""catalog""}}  But Lambert has no interest in following suit. In the new article, released on Thursday, the author writes , “When I ask Lambert if she thinks that at this moment in history — with, among other things, this particular president in office — there is an opening for her to make the kind of issue-oriented songs [Loretta] Lynn became known for, Lambert is quick to dismiss the idea.”  She is quoted as saying in response, “I am a 100 percent believer in not ever using the platform that I’ve built for anything other than music, because music to me is an escape from your own reality. I don’t want to go to a show and hear somebody preach about their opinions.” And when pushed, Lambert stood her ground.  “It’s so divided [in politics], you can’t win anyway. And what are you winning?” she asked. “For someone to agree with you, and now you’ve spoken your piece and pissed off many other people, just for one person to go, ‘She’s right’? It doesn’t do any good.” Lambert added, “I’m a country singer. We talk about tears in our beers.”  Lambert’s stance is in-line with that of another female country icon. As Gossip Cop reported in February, Reba McEntire argued on “The View” that entertainers shouldn’t talk politics. Elsewhere in the Billboard story, Lambert also discusses her decision not to do press for her last album, The Weight Of These Wings, to avoid discussing her divorce from Blake Shelton. “I just didn’t need to talk about the record,” she told the magazine.  Lambert continues, “If you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what happened, it’s all on there. There’s no mystery anymore — take from it what you will.” She also revealed she co-wrote “Vice” the very day the split went public in 2015. “I walked in with guns blazing,” she shared. “I just knew one thing: I didn’t want a breakup record.”",0

"Workers leave the site of the future Trump International Hotel, which is at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.“It’s something ironic,” said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.“The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.”Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.“Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.“He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation’s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country’s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Several of the laborers — who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day — fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.“Do you think that when we’re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we’re raping or selling drugs?” Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. “We’re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.”In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers.“Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said.Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said.Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.“Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.”A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks.The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel.[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’]At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century.Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.”For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.“Actually,” he reflected, “we’re more American than him.”",1

"Like their respectively memorable characters in 2011 rom-coms “No Strings Attached” and “Friends with Benefits,” Mila Kunis’ romance with Ashton Kutcher started casually.  Kunis, 34, opened up on her relationship with her “That '70s Show” co-star Kutcher on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast Monday, starting with her familiarity with Kutcher’s first marriage to actress Demi Moore.  “They had, like, a normal, real relationship,” the “Spy Who Dumped Me” star she told Maron. “They had three kids they were raising. It was, like, a normal life.”  In “That '70s Show,” their characters shared an on-and-off romantic relationship. Nothing came of it in reality as Kutcher wed actress Demi Moore near the show’s final season.  Kutcher and Moore split in 2011 and Kunis’ romantic interest began soon after.  “I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back,” she said of the time she saw him at a 2012 awards show. “I was literally like, ‘Oh, he’s kinda hot.’ And then he turned around, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s Kutch.’ I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.”  Characteristically, it all began with no strings attached, she said.  “We lived our movies out, where we were like, ‘Let’s just hook up. Let’s have fun. We’re both single. We both trust each other. Everything’s great.’ None of us wanted tension,” Kunis told Maron.  Kunis could only bear their friends with benefits relationship for only so long, however.  “We hooked up for three months. And just like our movies, one of us caught feelings.”  Kunis’ reaction when Kutcher told her about someone he was dating was the tell-tale sign she wanted them to be something more she said.  “I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,” Kunis said. “I was like … ‘Oh, my God. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so I’m going to speak up.’”  As we now know, Kutcher felt the same way; he asked her to move in the next day, Kunis said.  It has been all uphill from there.  The couple welcomed their daughter Wyatt in October 2014, got married in July 2015 and welcomed son Dimitri in November 2016.",1
"Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man: Homecoming was played by Zendaya. Samuel L. Jackson commanded the role of Nick Fury in The Avengers. In the movie Thor: Ragnarok, Idris Elba is the Asgardian gatekeeper Heimdall. Quvenzhané Wallis starred as the always singing and hopeful foster kid Annie. Brandy Norwood found her happily ever after as Cinderella with Whitney Houston dressed in gold as her fairy godmother. Will Smith protected Earth from aliens as Agent J in Men in Black.  What’s the significant common feature of these actors and their characters? They are all African-Americans playing characters who were originally white in their respective comic or children’s book.  Adding to the list is Candice Patton, who is in her fourth season of The Flash as Iris West. West is white in the DC comic, and her character is the no-fear-no-matter-the-danger, tough-as-nails journalist and longtime best friend of Barry Allen, aka The Flash. They’re married now and she leads S.T.A.R. Labs, the team behind The Flash in stopping crazy meta-human activity in Central City. The series airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.  The Plano, Texas, native began her career in Hollywood with a stint on The Young and the Restless after being chosen in a national college casting search for a guest role. Once Patton graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, she moved to Los Angeles to continue her acting career. Her television credits include appearances on Entourage, Castle, Grey’s Anatomy, The Game, CSI: Miami and Heroes, to name a few.  “It’s a huge honor because young people and future generations will remember Iris West as black,” said Patton, 29. “If my casting wasn’t working [for TV], they would have changed it for the film, but they didn’t [and cast Kiersey Clemons, another African-American woman], and that’s a great thing.”  There’s still a long way to go with diversity and inclusion in Hollywood, but celebrating every inch, foot and mile fought to push the glass ceiling higher is just as important as the fight.  While in Washington, D.C., for the “DC in D.C.” pop culture event, Patton spoke with The Undefeated about being a woman of color in Hollywood, how the leading lady on and offscreen has evolved and just how tearing her ACL as a cheerleader jump-started her passion for acting.  What have you learned from playing Iris West?  She is strong, fearless, passionate and emotional. There is strength in vulnerability, and Iris isn’t afraid to show her emotions. She won’t let that defeat her.  How is it both an honor and responsibility playing Iris, who is traditionally white in the comic book?  It’s a huge honor because young people and future generations will remember Iris West as black. They can see themselves as the ingénue. Iris is the love interest of the hero, he’s the one he desires. She’s the leader of the team; she’s the one who rallies everyone together. And that’s a really important role model for young girls and even boys.  #KeepIrisBlack has trended on Twitter. What significance does that have to you?  I got into acting to A) pay my rent and B) live out my dreams … but another part of it became being a voice for so many young women of color. They get to see themselves on-screen [when they watch The Flash]. I craved to see that as a child growing up. It was just never there. All of my heroes were white and blond. There’s nothing wrong with that, but what made it difficult for me as a black girl was that it felt outside of myself, like something over there … something that was so cool but could never happen to me. Even when I was starting out in Hollywood, all of the roles I was going for was the best friend of the pretty white girl. So now for the first time, I’m [metaphorically] the pretty white girl.  What actresses do you look up to?  I remember watching Halle Berry win that Oscar and thinking how an acting career path was possible for me. Her grace, dignity and class are all things I’ve aspired toward. Zoe Saldana has done an amazing job in the diverse roles she has acted in, and that further paves a huge path for women of color too.  Hollywood is recognizing interracial relationships, like that of Iris and Barry on The Flash, and finally normalizing it. Why is that important?  It’s very important because it becomes normal and less fearful for people who haven’t seen interracial couples in their own neighborhoods and communities. People see Iris and Barry and say, “Oh they’re just like us … a normal relationship.” Having diverse storylines in general across film and TV impacts communities and [deep-rooted] mindsets.  Leading women in TV and film have evolved. How would you define what a leading lady is today?  The leading lady is extremely important to the other heroes in the show. We used to see women as the sidekicks, but we’re moving away from that and women are becoming the heroes of their own stories. Iris is stepping into that, especially this season.  [Outside of the screen], we as a culture have a specific way of what we’re used to seeing women as or how we want to see women. But the change is happening because women are now deciding for themselves and we are saying, “No more.” We’re making choices that are going to make people uncomfortable because before it wasn’t the feminine way and it wasn’t acceptable for women [to do that]. But now we are seeing women step up and say, “No more. Thanks for your input, but I decide on what I wear, what profession I’m going to pursue and what I deserve to get paid.”  How did cheerleading play a part in you becoming an actress?  I grew up in Texas, so you either played football, went to the games or was a cheerleader. I enjoyed it a lot, but then tore my ACL. I couldn’t cheer for a while, so I ended up hanging out in the theater club, and the rest is pretty much history.  What insecurities have you overcome?  Fear of being wrong, making mistakes and being the perfect celebrity for people to look up to. I learned that I have to be true to who I am because people will see my sincerity through a mistake that way.  Where does your courage come from?  My mom and dad. My mom always tells me to be as proud as a peacock, and my dad as a now-retired FBI agent would say, “Just because you’re shot doesn’t mean you’re going to die.” I go through trials and tribulations, but it doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world. You just have to keep pushing through.  How has being a new dog mom changed your life?  My dog, Zoe, has changed my life and has been a great anxiety relief. She’s given me that sense of responsibility to love something outside of myself. Sometimes, this career can feel so self-absorbed because it’s a lot about you and your character. I just felt like it was about me, me, me, me for way too long. Having Zoe takes me outside of myself, which is great.  What’s your favorite throwback shows?  I grew up idolizing Lucille Ball. I’d watch I Love Lucy every single night. There was something about how she made me feel good and entertained. I just knew that I wanted to do that and be part of being in people’s home every night. Acting was a hobby that turned into my passion.  What emoji do you use the most?  The side-eye one. 👀  What’s your favorite movie-time snack?  Keiynan Lonsdale [who plays my brother Wally/Kid Flash on The Flash] introduced me to adding Maltesers chocolate to a warm bag of popcorn. I don’t even like chocolate, but this snack is on point.",1

"Taylor Swift, Katy Perry.  It’s been quite the month in Katy Perry news: She gave a boy his first kiss on American Idol and has been embroiled in a legal battle with a group of nuns over property in L.A. But amid all of that, Perry is still giving the people what they really want — reasons to believe she dislikes Taylor Swift.  When a contestant on American Idol apologized to Perry for saying that he loved Swift and looked up to her as a musician, Perry said, “I love her, as a songwriter, as well.” Then she made a face most accurately described as “¯\_(ツ)_/¯” and looked away.  The two singers have been publicly feuding since Swift called them “enemies” in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview. They’ve been fueling the feud fire ever since, most recently when Perry may have seduced Karlie Kloss away from Swift’s girl gang. But hey, she loves Swift as a songwriter still!",0

Aired 9-10a ETAired November 13, 2016 - 09:00 ETTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.[09:00:05](BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): President-elect Trump heads to the White House after an earthquake election few expected.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.TAPPER: Some say, not so fast, as protesters take to the streets in uproar.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Not my president!TAPPER: What will Donald Trump's America and his White House look like? Top adviser and potential Cabinet pick Rudy Giuliani will be here.Plus, Trump made big campaign promises, from Obamacare.TRUMP: Repealing and replacing Obamacare.TAPPER: To immigration.TRUMP: There will be no amnesty.TAPPER: And, of course:TRUMP: We will build a great wall.TAPPER: But he seems to be already backing off some of his signature lines. What will really get done? And can he work with Congress? An exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan.Plus, Clinton concedes.HILLARY CLINTON (D), FMR. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for.TAPPER: As Democrats lick their wounds.CLINTON: I'm not going to sugarcoat it. These have been very, very tough days. TAPPER: Should they have seen it coming? Michael Moore did -- what he says liberals must do now.Plus, the best political minds will be here with insights on this historic election.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is in transition.Donald Trump is now president-elect Trump. And the world is watching with bated breath to see just what he has in store for America. Protests against his election, of course, continue this weekend across the country, most of them peaceful, although the mayor of Portland, Oregon, is asking protesters to stand down in the wake of violence against police in that city.There are some reports of violence against Trump supporters. In Connecticut, two men were arrested for allegedly beating a man holding a Trump sign. Meanwhile, civil rights groups in school districts across the country report an uptick in incidents of intimidation and harassment of minority groups and girls and women.Graffiti in North Carolina reads: ""Black lives doesn't matter and neither does your votes.""""Go back to Africa. Make America great again"" was written in a high school bathroom in Minnesota.Tensions are high and tempers are flaring across the country. The country, of course, may be divided, but the government in Washington, D.C., is not. Republicans now control the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and, soon, the White House.So what is on the Trump agenda and how quickly can it get done?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Joining me now from Janesville, Wisconsin, is House Speaker Paul Ryan.Mr. Speaker, thanks so much for joining us.Before we begin talking about legislation and moving forward, I'm just wondering, there are millions of Americans out there, as I'm sure you know, who are frankly terrified about what this America under President Trump will mean for them.Is there anything that you, as speaker of the House, one of the leaders of the nation, want to say to them?REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Sure.First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And, second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured. America is a pluralistic, inclusive country. It has, it has been, and it will continue to be.So, I really think that people should put their minds at ease. We're going to get to work on solving the big country's problems, getting this economy growing, fixing our national security, you know, fixing our health care problems, getting our budget put together, the things that we have been talking about.So, I think people should just really put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic. We're inclusive. That's the kind of country we want. That's the country we are. And that's the country we're still going to have.TAPPER: But just to accept and acknowledge that there are these incidents taking place all over the country...RYAN: Well, first, yes, I heard your lead-in there. That's terrible. That's awful.By the way, that's not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they're not Republicans. And we don't want them in our party, even if they're thinking about it. And I'm confident Donald Trump feels the same way.So, there's no place for that. And protests, as long as protests are peaceful, if people want to express themselves that way, that's what we can do in this country. That's what the First Amendment is all about.TAPPER: Let's move forward to some of the action items.Obviously, repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the big items that president-elect Trump and you want to tackle. President-elect Trump recently said there are elements of Obamacare he wants to keep. This is what he to say to ""60 Minutes."" Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Let me does you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still covered?[09:05:01]TRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the -- strongest asset.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Now, your Better Way agenda talks about spending $25 billion on high-risk pools that would help those with preexisting conditions afford insurance. Where would that $25 billion come from?RYAN: Well, we actually have it paid for in our bill. You really want me to give you a technical answer to this? It gets a little technical.The point is, we have in our plan pay for doing that. Here's the bigger point, Jake. We agree. It's in our plan. Donald Trump agrees with this. We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions.In our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan. So, there are aspects that we have all along agreed to.TAPPER: Under Obamacare, as you know, millions of people were able to get health insurance for the first time through the expansion of Medicaid.What is going happen to those people? Will they lose coverage under your plan?RYAN: Well, if you go -- what I encourage people to do is go to Better.GOP. It's number five on our plan. We put the most detail out of anybody that has put out an Obamacare replacement plan.And it is to have an answer for everyone with preexisting conditions, people who are the uninsured. The point I would say is this, Jake. We can have a health care system in America where everyone, regardless of income or health condition, can get affordable health insurance, get affordable health care.This is what we propose. We think a patient-centered system is the right way to do that. And you can have the system without a costly government takeover, like Obamacare, that is cranking up premiums, that is making deductibles so high. Doesn't even feel like you have health insurance. Obamacare is failing. It must replaced.We're going to do that. We're excited about it. And the point I would put people's minds at ease is, we can fix these problems. We can fix what was broken in health care without breaking what was working in health care. And that's exactly what we're proposing.And if you want to get any level of detail on this, just go to Better.GOP and see what we have already offered.TAPPER: Well, as you know, the Medicaid expansion is providing government-paid health insurance to individuals. I mean, that's what it does. So, if you repeal Obamacare, does it repeal also the Medicaid expansion, or would that part of it stay?RYAN: For example, we propose to replace that with refundable tax credits for people to buy affordable health care insurance.So, the kinds of reforms that we're talking about will lower the cost of insurance itself. And then a person would have, such as our proposal calls for, a refundable tax credit, like a voucher, to go buy health insurance.That's much cheaper, much more affordable. And, more importantly, you get to buy what you want to buy, not what the government is making you buy.TAPPER: Obamacare also provides birth control to women at no cost. Is that going to end or will that remain?RYAN: Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things.TAPPER: With all do respect, I don't know that the average woman of child-bearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don't know that she would think that that's just a nitty-gritty detail. That's...RYAN: You're asking me detail...TAPPER: Well, what do you think? Is it important to you?RYAN: Jake, you're asking me details about legislation -- you're asking me details about legislation that hasn't been written yet.(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Right. But is it important to you? Would that be a principle? Would that be a principle of whatever replaces it, because...RYAN: I'm not going to get into -- I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet.TAPPER: Let me ask you a question about improving security at the border. You and Donald Trump both agree you want to improve security at the border. You obviously have different views when it comes to the 10 to 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.This is what you said to say back in April during a town hall at Georgetown University:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: I'm a person who believes that, for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesn't involve mass deportation, that involves giving people the ability to get right with the law to come and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Now take a listen to what president-elect Trump said on ""Morning Joe"" last year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""MORNING JOE"")TRUMP: We're going to have a deportation force. And you're going to do it humanelyQUESTION: How are you going to pay for this?TRUMP: It's very inexpensive.QUESTION: Are they going to be ripped out of their homes? How?TRUMP: Can I tell you, they're going back where they came. If they came from a certain country, they're going to be brought back to that country. That's the way it's supposed to be.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So, Congress writes the laws and controls the purse stringsIs there going to be mass deportation or not? And this isn't just a nitty-gritty detail. There are millions of people who are very worried about this.RYAN: Sure. Sure.And I think we should put people's minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border.We think that's first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who's coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border. So, we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill, is really the first priority. And that's what we're focused on.TAPPER: OK, so it's not a top priority, mass deportation. But, obviously, president-elect Trump thinks it is.RYAN: No, securing the border is our...TAPPER: Right.RYAN: Securing the border is our top priority.TAPPER: Right, but about what in year two, year three, year four?RYAN: That's why I'm saying we're not focused on -- we are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.[09:10:03]TAPPER: Well, let me ask you, and does the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, does that impact in any way your sense of mandate or how far you should be willing to go, considering that the woman who lost actually got more votes?RYAN: I'd say two things.Look at the expectations going into this. Look at what all the public polling said. Look at what all the prognosticators were saying like the day of the election. He beat all the odds.Look, what I think people need to stop doing is stop underestimating Donald Trump. A lot of us did that. I think he's very much of the mind-set that there is a need to unify this country, to heal the division in this country, but also there's a mandate and a desire and a commitment to fix the problems as we have laid the solutions out.So, we all laid out very concrete solutions for why we need to get this country back on track. We're now going to implement the solutions. And we think this is good. We think this is going to help people get out of poverty. We think this is going to grow the economy, make our country more secure, make our border secure, help the military go on offense against ISIS, clean up the red tape that is strangling small businesses, so they can hire people again.These are good things that we have in store that we're really excited about getting to work on doing for the American people.TAPPER: One of the things that you don't mention -- and I can certainly understand why -- when you talk about the path forward with president-elect Trump is one of the biggest differences between yourself and Donald Trump policy-wise, having to do with the issue of trade.In his contract with the American voter, he promised in his 100 days to establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers. Will you pass those tariffs in your first 100 days?RYAN: Well, I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue.And if you go to number six on our Better Way agenda and you look at the tax reform, this is something that Donald also talked about during the campaign, which is to fix our taxes on border adjustments, which we believe is a smarter way, which is what all the other countries, which is not tariffs, not trade wars.So, we think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it's fixing our tax code.TAPPER: Throughout the campaign, as you know, president-elect Trump talked about tariffs. It could be as high as 35 percent, 45 percent.RYAN: Yes.TAPPER: If he comes to you and says, this is what we're doing, what are you going say?RYAN: The point I'm trying to make is, I think we can achieve what he's trying -- he's trying to make America more competitive. He's trying to make the American worker more competitive. He's trying to make it so that American businesses stay in America.And we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform, which actually makes America much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy.TAPPER: A minute ago, you were talking about how Donald Trump, the president-elect, expressed concerned to you he wanted to -- or expressed a desire to you that he wanted to unify the country. On that note, I want to turn to staffing at the Trump White House. Alot of people, including many conservatives, are concerned that Steve Bannon, who is the CEO of the Trump campaign and the chief executive of Breitbart News, that he used Breitbart News to, in their view, the view of conservatives, the view of Republicans, to mainstream white supremacist views, anti-Semitic views, racist views.Do you have any concerns about Steve Bannon being in the White House?RYAN: No, I don't have concerns. I have never met the guy. I don't know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns.I believe -- I trust Donald's judgment. I think he's going to pick who he thinks will best serve him. And I'm sure we will work well with whoever his chief of staff is, whoever his staff is.So, I believe that Donald is going to have a great set of choices to make for staffing. I'm also very own encouraged by the fact that my friend, a great conservative from -- a man whose shown he's a true leader, Mike Pence, is going to be running the transition team.So, I think between Pence running the transition team -- look, Donald is a multibillionaire who has had lots of companies, who has run extremely successful businesses. So, he's done things like this before. He's staffed up. He's run major organizations. He's a successful person. He surrounds himself with successful people.So, I'm confident he's going to do the same here.TAPPER: You sound very optimistic and positive about him, but during the campaign, you said that one of the things he said about Judge Curiel fit the textbook definition of racism.RYAN: Look, I'm not going to relitigate the past. I'm looking for the future.And I want I mean when I say unifying, getting people back to work, fixing welfare so people -- fixing welfare so people can go from welfare to work, replacing this horrible health care law that is really hurting families, putting health care providers out of business, and replacing it with patient-centered health care, rebuilding our national security so we're safe again, cleaning up the regulatory state, following the Constitution.I mean, these are all good things for our country that we are now working on putting in place the plan to do just that. That's transformational. That's positive. That's good.[09:15:01]TAPPER: The pride of Janesville, House Speaker Paul Ryan, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.RYAN: All right, thank you Jake. Take care.(END VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER: The Trump transition team has been huddled inside Trump Tower all weekend as they work to create an administration, Cabinet nominees, White House staff.Kellyanne Conway telling reports yesterday that Trump's choice for chief of staff is imminent. That and other picks could tell us a lot about how president-elect Trump plans to govern.Let's talk about the new Trump administration with top adviser Rudy Giuliani, who is himself rumored to be a contender for several top jobs.Mr. Mayor, thanks for joining us. And congratulations.RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Thank you, Jake.TAPPER: So, I know you're not going to answer...GIULIANI: Thank you very, very much, Jake.TAPPER: I know you're not going to answer any questions I have about what jobs you're being considered for.(LAUGHTER)TAPPER: So, let me just set that aside.There's a big issue...GIULIANI: Thank you.(LAUGHTER)TAPPER: There's a big issue at play here as you prepare for the Trump administration.I know you're more than cognizant of the fact that Donald Trump has hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in businesses and business interests around the nation and throughout the world. During the campaign, he was asked what he would do with his businesses if he won.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts. I have Ivanka and Eric and Don sitting there.Run the company, kids. Have a good time. I'm going to do it for America, OK?(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: So, I would be willing to...QUESTION: So, you will put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust.Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it, but -- is that a blind trust? I don't know.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: I will answer that question. That's not a blind trust. If your kids run your businesses, it's not a blind trust.In a blind trust, there is an independent trustee who takes over your portfolio and directs it without your input or any input from anyone around you.Do you think that to avoid any conflicts of interest, not to many questions by the public as to whether he's making decisions at least in part for his own financial reasons, do you think it would be best for Mr. Trump to set up a true blind trust with no involvement from him or his kids?GIULIANI: Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.I think he's in a very unusual situation. He would basically put his children out of work if -- and they'd have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up the whole -- set up new problems.So, it would seem to me that if he set up a situation in which the children were running it, there was a legal or clear document that meant that he would not be involved, he would have no interest in it, he would have no input into it, he would just have a passive interest, that would be the kind of thing that would work here.It's kind of unrealistic to say, you're going to take the business away from the three people who are running it, and give it to some independent person. And, remember, they can't work in the government because of the government rule against nepotism.So, you would be putting them out of work. So, I think you're going to have to fashion something that is very comfortable, something that's fair, something that assures the American people, as he said, he has no interest in what's going on in the business, and that his children get to run the business they know how to run.TAPPER: Right.GIULIANI: And stay out of all government matters.TAPPER: Well, but, Mr. Mayor, I mean, his children are -- as I don't need to tell you, they are a huge part of his advisory committee. They are advising the transition, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric.Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, is being talked about as coming on board and working at the White House, even if he's not paid for it.If he does not set up a truly blind trust, how can the American people have confidence that, when he makes a decision, that he isn't at least partly making it to enrich himself?GIULIANI: Well, even if he turned it over to an independent trustee and it was the Trump Corporation, you can't -- I mean, there's no perfect way to do this.You have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president. The man is an enormously wealthy man. I don't think there's any real fear of suspicion that he's seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn't have run for president.So, I think there can be a way to do this. And, by the way, Jared Kushner has his own company, completely independent of Trump, that is a very, very successful real estate company. He's maybe, you know, one of the biggest in New York. He -- so, Jared is a kind of different, different situation.TAPPER: Well, I will just say this. And then you can dismiss it as you want. But I'm putting a flag in it right now.If a blind trust is not set up, this is going to be Donald Trump for the duration of his presidency, because every decision he makes, whether it's the pipeline in North Dakota, or business relationships in Turkey, everything is going to be under the lens of, well, what is the effect of this on his wealth and his family's wealth?[09:20:07]I get that you think that that's not a consideration or not as serious a consideration as...GIULIANI: No, no, no.What I'm telling you is, the blind trust solution isn't much better, meaning an independent trustee would run it. And any decision that he made, even if he didn't know it, that helped him, somebody would run it down and say, oh, my goodness, he may have made it for that reason.So, blind trusts aren't perfect either. This is a very special kind of situation.TAPPER: I think it's far better than -- it's far better than people in his family advising him and then also working on his business. I think...GIULIANI: But they're not -- once he gets into government, they will not be -- they will not be -- they will not be advising him.There will be -- there will have to be a wall -- there will have to be a wall between them with regard to government matters and something I'm very familiar with from my days in the Justice Department, which is recusing yourself from decisions that involve you or any financial matter involving you.TAPPER: All right.Well, if you thought the issues between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department were big, fasten your seat belts. But let's move on.Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary by...GIULIANI: Oh, I think, I think, Jake, Jake, Jake, I think that's a very unfair suggestion.There, you were talking about enormous amounts of cash. I'm counting up to about $230 million that went for specific actions like talking to the IRS. And I don't -- I don't see that happening in a Trump administration.This man didn't run for president because he wants to get rich. He's rich already.TAPPER: All right.GIULIANI: So, I don't think you're going to have that happen unless you try to make it happen.TAPPER: All right.Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary back in December when he made this promise. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling all and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is doing on.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So, just a simple question. Is that policy still operative?GIULIANI: Well, you know, twice, you used things that he changed during the campaign. He did say that. That is correct.Actually, within a day or two of his saying that, he called me and asked me to put a little group together that included Congressman McCaul, General Flynn -- I can't remember who else, a few other people. We wrote a paper for him. And he amended it to the ban would be restricted to particular countries, and it would not be a ban.It would involve extreme vetting. The one -- the one place in which he would not let anyone in, unless it was an extraordinary circumstance, would be Syrian refugees. All the rest from countries that contain dangerous populations of radical Islamic extremists, he will subject them to extreme vetting, but not a ban. So, he said that about 100 times during the campaign from the timethat he made that -- from the time that he made that statement.TAPPER: Yes, he said that was an expansion.GIULIANI: So, you can go back.TAPPER: He said it was an expansion of his original proposal.But let's talk about what you're talking about, specifically, Mr. Trump wanting to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur and also extreme vetting.Back in June, when Senator Jeff Sessions, a strong supporter and adviser of president-elect Trump, when Senator Sessions was on the program, he identified six countries that might fall into that category, Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen.So, now that Mr. Trump has been elected president, can you tell us if those are the six countries that will see a suspension of immigration?GIULIANI: Well, I would say that those countries are certainly countries where we would have to be very careful.Now, let's take Egypt, for example. Egypt, we could probably do some pretty good vetting. The Sisi government is a strong ally. It has a pretty good hold on the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying perfect, but they have done a lot of work in reducing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood. They have a very, very mature and really strong army. You could do vetting in Egypt.Yemen, a lot more volatile, a lot more difficult to do vetting. So, I think this is going to be a country-by-country decision. Pakistan, you can do pretty good vetting. So, a lot of this is going to depend on, you know, how cooperative is the country we're talking about? How many records can we get?The reason the Syrian problem was so bad, the Syrian refugees, it's not just that you can't vet them, which actually Director Comey and I think about five members of the Obama administration have made clear, that you can't vet these people, these refugees from Syria.[09:25:12]The problem also is that Baghdadi has said he is going to put terrorist operatives in with the refugee population. He's told us he's going to do this.TAPPER: Right.GIULIANI: So, we would be foolish -- we would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States.We're sort of being warned that he's bringing more people into attack us. We already have 1,000 investigations of radical Islamic terrorists in the United States. We can't add another whole group to that.TAPPER: I want to ask you. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted as saying that the Russian government maintained contacts with members of Trump's -- quote -- ""immediate entourage"" during the presidential campaign.What can you tell us about those contacts?GIULIANI: I know of no such contacts with the Russian government.I was pretty deeply involved in the campaign. I was with Donald Trump, you know, day and night for about 100 days actually at one period. So, if that's going on, it's going on somewhere where I didn't see it.It is true that I think Donald Trump wants to engage Russia in areas where we can work together in a way that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama failed to do. But, remember, he's going to do it from a different point of view.You're forgetting his campaign promise of increasing dramatically the size of the military and doing away with the sequester. We're going to go up to 550,000 troops, where we're going down to 420,000.TAPPER: Well, let me ask you a quick question about troops.GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 ships.TAPPER: Putin...GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 troops (sic). Let me finish.TAPPER: Yes.GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 1,200 modern aircraft. And we're going to increase the size of the Marines from about 27 battalions to 36.So, he's going to be facing, Putin, with a country that is not diminishing its military, but a country that is dramatically increasing it to Reagan-like levels, so that he can negotiate -- and he talked about this a lot during the campaign -- he's going to negotiate for peace, but with strength, not with a diminishing army.TAPPER: A spokesman for Putin said that one of the first things that Trump can do as president is to convince NATO to pull back troops from near the Russian border.Do you have any idea if any decision has been made along those lines?GIULIANI: No. No decision like that has been made, thought about.In fact, during the campaign, Donald Trump talked about forward positioning of some troops in NATO as kind of a bargaining chip with some of the NATO countries that are not putting in their fair share, their 2 percent. TAPPER: OK.GIULIANI: And I think you're going see something more like that.I think a President Trump would want to increase the impact of NATO, but make sure that these countries are participating. You know, when we were fighting in Iraq and we had some of these countries participating, their armies weren't fighting. They were watching us, the U.K., and Canada fight, and they were just observing.Well, it can't work that way.TAPPER: All right.GIULIANI: They have got to be full participants. And we have to be full participants.TAPPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much. And congratulations again.GIULIANI: Thank you.TAPPER: Donald Trump used the power of social media to help propel him into the White House. He instantly was able to fight back against critics, reporters, even members of his own party if they challenged him, which begged the question, what will President Trump' Twitter feed look like?We now have his answer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all. I'm going to be very restrained.I find it tremendous. It is a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's -- it's where it's at.I do believe this. I really believe that the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: President Obama is going to have to hand over the @POTUS Twitter handle to president-elect Trump.What should we expect from @POTUS when he enters the Oval Office?Joining me now is our panel, Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer, CNN politics reporter Sara Murray, CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson, and House Democratic Caucus Leader Congressman Xavier Becerra of California.Sean, let me start with you.In the final stretch of the campaign, it was reported that some of president-elect Trump's top aides had to wrest his phone away from him, so as to not have one of these sudden outbursts in the middle of the night or whatever.[09:30:10]What do you see going forward for the POTUS account?SEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think there's always a transition from campaigning to governing. You've seen it both with his speech Wednesday morning when he accepted that victory that he won for the American people. And then his comments when he was in Washington, D.C. with the president and others.He understands that. He understands the role of the president in the words that he uses and the tweets that he sends will impact the country in a much different way than they do during a campaign.TAPPER: Good enough for you, congressman?REP. XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA: No, because we've heard all sorts of words from Donald Trump.As a candidate you can say all you want, as a president, one word you say can affect not just markets, but the American people. So interest rates have already spiked. They are not sure what's going to happen in the markets since -- so today we try to buy a house as an American, it costs you more for the mortgage than it did two weeks ago. And so it will make a difference what he says. More importantly what he does.TAPPER: Sara, you covered Trump for the last year and a half. He has since winning, there has been one kind of stray tweet in which he got mad at protesters and then I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but then he corrected it and celebrated their right to protest.How do you see this holding, this quote/unquote ""Presidential Trump""?SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Well, he's already tweeting this morning attacks at ""The New York Times.""So I think the notion that all the sudden Donald Trump has woken up and realized that his weight carry or his words carry a lot more weight doesn't always stand. I think there are aides around him who remind him that you need to recalibrate your tone. I think that's what we saw from the two different tweets about protesters. One going after them and then one saying I love to see passionate people expressing their belief. That to me was a good indication that someone talked to him and said words matter more now, but the fact is, he still does have control of his Twitter. And there doesn't seem to be anyone who's sitting with him this morning. So I still think it is an open question of how he behaves and if he does realize that there are millions and millions of people following him there. And there already even more once he takes over the POTUS Twitter handle.TAPPER: This is a silly question on its face but I actually mean it very seriously. Do you think that -- I mean, obviously there were tweets sent out under his name by him and there are ones sent out by his campaign, you can actually tell ones were which by which device it was sent by.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes.TAPPER: Do you think it is up to Kellyanne Conway or whomever in his inner circle to change his password so he no longer has access to his Twitter feed?HENDERSON: You would hope something like that happens. I don't even know the way in which he tweets if he's just firing them off, dictating them to somebody else who fires them off but this is going to be a problem.Primarily because Donald Trump has made the best argument for why he should keep tweeting in the same way, and that is, oh, he won. And it didn't harm him throughout the primaries. It didn't harm him in the general election. He actually believes it's helped him.And I also think, if you look at the people who support Donald Trump, they like that bombast. They like that rhetoric. That -- they like the fact that he isn't some sort of P.C. blow-dried politician. So in that way, I think it's going to be hard to rest some of the -- not only the Twitter account from him, but the way he engages with the public, the way he engages with the media, the way he engages with his own party and the folk that he is doesn't like, whether it's Ted Cruz or Ted Cruz or Ted Cruz's wife or whoever. I think this is going to be an issue and I'm not so sure that it's going to be -- we see another Donald Trump once he assumes the office.TAPPER: Sara, we were talking before the show about how the Trump people are constantly trying to act as though he didn't propose banning all Muslims from entering the United States until a total complete shutdown until we figure out just what the hell is going on.You heard Mayor Giuliani say that he basically walked that back although as you know he expanded it -- he described it as an expansion. Take a listen to what Mr. Trump -- president-elect Trump had to say about the issue just a few days ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Are you going to ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country?TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: So where is this policy?MURRAY: That's a great question. I think this is going to be a question for a lot of Donald Trump's policies. Because we put a lot out there on the campaign trail. That he didn't necessarily flush out entirely and that he sort of walked back at points and then doubled down at points. That's what we saw with the Muslim ban.The last thing we heard from Donald Trump was that when he talked about extreme vetting which at times included a religious test that to him was an expansion of the Muslim ban. But I think we saw the same thing when you talked to Paul Ryan about the notion of a deportation force and Donald Trump on a deportation force. Maybe they're not calling it a deportation force anymore. Maybe that's not what Donald Trump's calling it. Maybe that's not what House Speaker Paul Ryan is calling it.But he has called for 5,000 additional border control agents. He has called for tripling the number of ICE officers. So there is certainly some sort of bolstering of these forces that would allow for increased deportation which is something Donald Trump promised.[09:35:01]But I think everyone is kind of waiting to see how these things Donald Trump talks about on the campaign trail will turn into actual policy when he's in the White House and when he's dealing with Capitol Hill.TAPPER: There does seem to be, Sean, a certain degree of people who are within the Trump orbit acting as though he didn't make certain proposals during the campaign that are on videotape or on the Donald J. Trump website. I mean, why is it an unreasonable question to ask if the Muslim ban is actually going to happen or a deportation --(CROSSTALK)SPICER: It's not unreasonable question.But I think that there's going to be a time between now and January 20th where he will assemble a team and his priorities of how he's going to get things done. He's got to work with Congress. And I think those conversations that started the other day have to continue in terms of this isn't a dictatorship. This is democracy. We have to work with the House and the Senate. He will continue his discussions with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell to layout the priorities of the sequencing but then also the exact -- the details of those policies.TAPPER: Congressman Becerra, we talked -- I talked to you on the beginning of the show with Speaker Ryan about the fears that many Americans feel.You represent a district with a large Latino population in California. What are people feeling in your district?BECERRA: I've heard everything from kids afraid to go to school because they're not sure their parents will be home when they get there. I've heard some families talk about not going to work. I've heard some people afraid to walk the streets because they may look like they're Muslim. I've heard everything and there is a great deal of apprehension.Be a great time right now. This is a prime time now for Donald Trump. It would be great time for him to get out there and say some words that would calm people to make sure that everyone feels comfortable going out. Whether it's to demonstrate civilly or whether it's just to go to school, but this is prime time now. And Donald Trump's words will make a big difference because so much of his talk during the campaign was so harsh and for many people, frightening.TAPPER: And Nia-Malika, take a look at this. This is from York, Pennsylvania, where students were caught on camera holding a Trump sign while another student shouted, white power.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: White power. White power. White power.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So that's a -- I don't know if that's a vine. It's a loop of some sort. But in any case, there's an investigation going on there, minority students have said they experienced more harassment since this election started.Now as I mentioned at the top of the show, there has also been violence against Trump supporters. But in the schools of America anecdotally it seems to be a lot of this. Do you think that president-elect Trump and in addition, perhaps even President Obama and Hillary Clinton have an obligation to come out and try to calm things?HENDERSON: I think they do.You heard some of that from Donald Trump in his Wednesday morning address when he talked about binding America's wounds. And you've heard that from also Paul Ryan talking about the Republican Party being the party of Lincoln and being and inclusive party.I do think it's incumbent on Donald Trump to shift his rhetoric, to continue the rhetoric about unity. I do think he probably has a steeper heel to climb. Because I think just plainly, there are a lot of Americans who think that Donald Trump is a bigot and they don't think he's a bigot because they have any sort of prejudged notions about a Republican president, they think that because of some of the things he said during the campaign.So the question is, can he give a sort of Bob Dole speech, the kind of speech he gave in the 1996 convention where he said, we're not a party of racists, talking about Republicans. Can he give that speech? And will people believe him? I think that's the question.You know, I've heard from friends too. I've got a friend who's a middle school teacher. He said the Latino students were lined up at his door on Wednesday morning. Some of them weren't even his students. And they were incredibly afraid about what this president, he would look like, and what it would mean for them and their families.TAPPER: Big challenge for president-elect Trump going forward. Thank you so much one and all.Coming up protests against Donald Trump's election continue across the country this weekend. On the frontlines at Trump Tower, Michael Moore who predicted a Trump win. He'll be here live, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:43:16]TAPPER: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper.In the days since her defeat by Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has been pretty busy. She was spotted walking her dog in the woods of Chappaqua. She handed out thousands of red roses to her campaign staff to thank them. And she at least partially pinned the blame for her loss on the FBI director.Clinton telling donors on a conference call yesterday that the first letter released by Director Comey stopped the momentum she had built after the debates and the release of Trump's Access Hollywood tape. And that it was too much for her to overcome.Let's talk about that and much more with filmmaker Michael Moore who tried to warn his fellow Democrats of a Trump win on this show, on his blog and elsewhere.Thanks so much for joining us, MichaelMICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Thanks for having me, Jake.TAPPER: So what do you make of Hillary Clinton telling donors on Saturday that FBI Director Comey is at least largely to blame for her loss? Do you agree? Is she is in denial, what's your take?MOORE: I think it's part of it, absolutely. And I would -- I've actually called upon President Obama to appoint a special prosecutor, as soon as possible, to investigate how it is that the FBI director was able to interfere with an election, which I believe is not legal and help to tip the balance in what was going to be a very close election. I think that not only should people speak about it, it needs to be investigated.TAPPER: But, let's talk about one of the other weaknesses clearly of her campaign which you were talking about months ago which is the fact that there wasn't really any sort of direct economic outreach or plan to working class white voters in places like Michigan where you're from.Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania telling the ""New York Times"" that the Clinton campaign failed to spread its best resources outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[09:45:04]He wanted the Clinton campaign doing more in the rural white pockets of the state saying quote, ""We had the resources to do both. The campaign -- and this was coming from her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn -- didn't want to do it.""Do you think that this is also a large part of what happened?MOORE: Yes. I think that also is part of it.I think how many months was it before she hadn't been to Wisconsin? I know she hadn't been to Michigan. There was a rush trip at the end there to Grand Rapids.But, you know, I mean, where I come from -- I live in Michigan, so we're used to both parties. The Republican Party, which controls the state House and the governor in Michigan has contributed to poisoning the people of Flint and still hasn't fixed the problem. So we're used to the treatment of that party.We're also used to the neglect, the benign neglect from Democrats or I should say the old school Democrats who basically -- once they get in have a hard time dealing with, especially cities that have large minority populations or in the cases of say Flint or Detroit, these are majority black cities and they largely go ignored (ph). They get a lot of lip service.And the funny thing is that Donald Trump kind of saw that and made that point, even though he will be the last person to visit Detroit or Flint to help us. And I think that the people that voted for him in Michigan are going to again be up for another rude awakening when they realize he's going to not do a damn thing to make the situation better and probably will make it worse.TAPPER: Obviously a lot of people who supported Hillary Clinton are trying to deal with this new world order. Oprah Winfrey, for example, making headlines angering a lot of Clinton supporters with comments that she made about Trump and Obama.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OPRAH WINFREY, TALK SHOW HOST: I just saw president-elect Trump with president Obama in the White House, and it gave me hope.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.WINFREY: It gave me hope. I mean, I have to say, just to hear president-elect Trump say that he had respect for President Obama, it felt that he had reached a moment where he was actually humbled by that experience. I think everybody can take a deep breath.(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: What do you think?MOORE: Well, that's why we love Oprah.Somebody needs to say that. We do need hope. I was hope. I was hopeful when I saw the two of them there because Trump looked like he didn't belong there. And he felt so uncomfortable in his own skin sitting there in that chair, you know, just like -- and Obama, I think we counted 15 o 16 ums as he was trying say something nice.Look, that's the side show that has to happen in a week like this. But frankly, you know, Democrats would be better off if they ran Oprah or Tom Hanks or -- why don't we run beloved people? We have so many of them.The Republicans do this. They run Reagan and the terminator and other people. Why don't we, why don't we run somebody that the American people love? That they are really drawn to and they're smart and have good politics and all that. Why don't Democrats do that?I'm telling you, Jake, my sincere hope is that the DNC that there is a clean sweep in this party. They all have to go, and they have to make room for the progressive Democrats who are going to come in here, are going to be needed to fight the things that Trump is going to do to the people of this country and the world. And we need young people, and women, and others who are going to really be the voice of this party.Not the same old, same old -- clearly people wanted change. I think everybody has admitted that and clearly Bernie Sanders represented that. And you know, I was -- I was at the demonstration yesterday and there were Trump people there on the sidewalk. And I went over and talked to them and I said, you know, would you have considered voting for Bernie Sanders? And they said yes, they were just mad at the system.TAPPER: Well let me ask you this, so that's the big question, what did Democrats do going forward organizationally, do they double down on progressive views the kind espoused by Bernie Sanders? Do they try to reach out to somebody who understands the working class white voters that voted for Donald Trump in droves? A fight already under way for the DNC chair. Several people have put their names forward including Howard Dean, Martin O'Malley, Congressman Keith Ellison who has the support of Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer.Who do you think the party should go with?MOORE: Keith Ellison. That is the exact way to go. That is the future.[09:50:01]We live -- we live -- the fear that I think a lot of white voters have is that they know the truth, which is that as the census bureau says, before 2050, white people are going to be the minority in this country. MOORE: For the last two Septembers now, the majority of kindergartners entering school in America are not white.

"Her biggest project yet just dropped! Cardi B gave birth to her first child with husband Offset on Tuesday, July 10.  The “Bodak Yellow” rapper welcomed a girl named Kulture Kiari. She announced the news via Instagram with a nude photo of herself cradling her baby bump.  Cardi kept her pregnancy under wraps for months before finally revealing her bump during her stint as a musical guest on an April episode of Saturday Night Live. “I’m finally free!” the 25-year-old remarked as she walked off stage from her performance.  Shortly after the happy news was confirmed, Cardi and her sister, Hennessy Carolina, began hinting that the artist was expecting a baby girl. The “Be Careful” rapper confirmed the sex of her little one in a May interview on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show.  In the months leading up to her daughter’s arrival, the “Finesse” rapper canceled several performances. “Shorty keep growing and I be looking like I be moving and everything, but in reality, a bitch barely can breathe,” she told her followers in an April Instagram video.  The expectant mom didn’t completely quit working, though. “She’s been taking a ton of meetings with designers for her Fashion Nova Line,” a source told Us Weekly in May. “She’s stopped doing shows, but she isn’t letting the pregnancy slow her down.” Us also exclusively reported at the time that Cardi was due in July.  The “I Like It” rapper confirmed in June that she and Offset, 26, secretly married in September 2017. “There are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep for myself! Getting married was one of those moments!” she wrote in a Twitter note at the time. “Our relationship was so new breaking up and making up and we had a lot of growing up to do but we was so in love we didn’t want to lose each other.”  She continued: “Was one morning in September we woke up and decided to get married. We found someone to marry us, and she did, just the two of us and my cousin. I said I do, with no dress, no makeup and no ring!”  Offset publicly proposed to the artist one month after their top-secret wedding in October 2017 during a Philadelphia concert. Video of what appeared to be the Migos rapper — who has three children from previous relationships — in bed with another woman emerged not long after, but Cardi chose to stick with her husband.

"DuShon Monique Brown, an actress best known for her role on NBC’s Chicago Fire, died Friday. She was 49.  The actress died after 12 p.m. on Friday at the Franciscan St. James Health Olympia Fields hospital just outside of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reported. Brown’s cause of death was not immediately disclosed.  On Chicago Fire, Brown played the witty and pragmatic Connie, the assistant to Chief Boden, and appeared on the show since it began in 2012.  “The ‘Chicago Fire’ family is devastated to lose one of its own,” Dick Wolf, the show’s executive producer, said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with DuShon’s family and we will all miss her.”  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  In a 2016 interview with the Huffington Post, Brown described the cast and crew of Chicago Fire as a family. “I’m not on set every day, but people are always asking me about my kid and how my day is going and they are all so very sweet and kind,” she said.  Recently, the actress told Hidden Remote that Connie, her character on the show, wasn’t supposed to be a series regular initially. When auditioning for the role, she said, she realized the “one-liner” role could develop into something more. The character then became more complex and served as sort of a mother figure, Brown said.  “They’ve done this beautiful dance with Connie where you see her soft moments, you see how she cares about the kids in the firehouse,” Brown said.  Brown had a similar experience during her 13-episode stint on AMC’s Prison Break, where her character, initially just called “Nurse,” developed into a larger role, later named Katie Welch. She appeared on that show from 2005 to 2007.  Throughout her career, Brown also appeared in a number of other TV shows and films, including Shameless and Empire. When not in front of the camera, Brown worked as a crisis counselor at Kenwood Academy High School in Chicago and led its drama program, according to the Tribune.  Growing up, Brown attended Whitney Young Magnet High School in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in psychology. She is survived by her daughter, Zoe.  “We are devastated by the loss of a very talented and kindhearted soul,” Robert Shroeder, Brown’s manager at Grossman & Jack Talent in Chicago told the Tribune. “She brought laughter and joy to many, and she will be greatly missed.”  Contact us at editors@time.com.",1
"Harry Styles has a unique sense of style ... or does he? The singer-songwriter admits he has models his look after '90s country-pop superstar Shania Twain , who was one of his mom's favorite artists when he was growing up.  ""I think both music and fashion, [my] main influence was probably Shania Twain. I think she's amazing,"" Styles raves to Entertainment Tonight .  It's a surprising connection, no doubt, but makes sense when you look at the former One Direction frontman and the country icon — both love colorful, extravagant outfits that defy the norm.  Styles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town 's "" Girl Crush "" during a show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act.

He'll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour . Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton , citing himself as a ""massive fan."" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson , who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it ""something real.""  Twain's latest album, Now, her first studio album release since 2002's massively successful Up!, landed at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2017. The album's second single ""We Got Something They Don't"" is currently on country radio.",0

"If you were one of those kids that asked for a pony every birthday of your childhood, only to find yourself receiving last season’s Barbie doll and a McDonald’s McFlurry, you might want to look away now.  To celebrate Harper Beckham’s birthday, David and Victoria have reportedly splashed the cash and bought her a £7,000 pedigree pony.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A soure reportedly told the Sun: ‘A few months ago, David and Victoria bought Harper some riding lessons and she fell in love with the sport.  ‘She’s horse-mad and has spent the past few weeks badgering her parents for a pony of her own.’    The youngster - who turns seven today - has also reportedly received riding gear from Colne Saddlery in Cheltenham.  'Obviously, a horse is a massive commitment, and David and Victoria have impressed upon her how important it is that she cares for it herself and gets stuck into the mucking out.

"Instead, she first broke ground in her early career as a member of the early '90s dance troupe, The Fly Girls, on the sketch comedy TV show, In Living Color. But, as a self-described ""camera hog"" influenced by the movie musicals of her childhood, it wasn't long before she was on the silver screen and in the studio.  ""I watched a lot of musicals because of my mom and that influenced me very much in the fact that a career in this business would have to be all three,"" she explained to James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio.  She inched closer toward movie star with films like Money Train and Jack before landing the role of a lifetime as Selena Quintanilla in the eponymous 1997 film. By 27, she was a Golden Globe nominee. Not before long, the star was pulling triple duty as an actress, dancer and singer as her debut studio album, On the 6, charted in the Billboard 200 top 10 and was certified triple platinum in the United States in 1999.

"Amber Heard stayed true to her word and donated her $7 million divorce settlement from Johnny Depp to charities focused on helping to stop violence against women and the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.  Children’s Hospital Los Angeles revealed Monday that the 31-year-old actress donated between $1 million and $5 million sometime during the July 2016 to June 2017 fiscal year.  “On behalf of all the children and families whose lives you have impacted, and everyone at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, we offer our sincere thanks,” the hospital wrote in its 2017 annual report under the “Honor Roll of Donors.”  The rest of the divorce settlement money was divided among charities with “a particular focus to stop violence against women,” People reported. Heard previously said her philanthropic work “centered around medical care, especially women and children.”  It's unclear when Heard made the donations to the other charities.  Heard filed for divorce from Depp in 2016 after being married for 15 months. The couple met on the set of “The Rum Diary"" in 2011. Their ugly split was surrounded by claims that Depp physically and verbally abused Heard. Depp was accused of throwing a cellphone at Heard during a drunken attack.  Heard announced in August she would be donating the money.  “As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves,” Heard said in a statement.",1

"Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.  According to TMZ, the troubled actress was charged Thursday with one misdemeanor count of interfering with a law enforcement officer and two counts of misdemeanor battery for allegedly attacking first responders.  How Heather Locklear went from TV's hottest actress to struggling star  Ventura County Superior Court records show that Locklear will have a misdemeanor pre-trial hearing on Thursday as well.  Locklear was arrested in February for felony domestic violence and battery on a police officer after an ensuing fight with her boyfriend at her home in Los Angeles.  She was charged with five criminal counts in that case, but was not charged with hitting her boyfriend despite being arrested for the offense.  In June, Locklear was hospitalized and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold after she allegedly choked her father and struck her mother.  The ""Melrose Place"" alum voluntarily entered rehab following her release.  Locklear is best known for appearing on ""Dynasty"" and ""T.J. Hooker"" in the 1980s and ""Melrose Place"" in the 1990s.

She was arrested previously in 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence. However, the charges were later dismissed.  She was sentenced at the time to three years of informal probation and ordered to pay $700 as a fine and to take a driving safety class.  Fox News' Leora Arnowitz contributed to this report.",1

"The 51st CMA Awards were held in Nashville on Wednesday, with Garth Brooks taking home the night’s top honor of Entertainer of the Year for the sixth time in his storied career. Brooks, who triumphed over Chris Stapleton, Keith Urban, Luke Bryan and Eric Church, returned from hiatus in 2014 and launched a sprawling world tour that will continue through the end of 2017. Brothers Osborne and Chris Stapleton wound up as the night’s most-awarded performers, with two wins each.  Stapleton’s From A Room: Volume 1 was named Album of the Year, beating out a stack of critically acclaimed releases that included Miranda Lambert’s The Weight of These Wings and Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit’s The Nashville Sound.

"Rihanna‘s roar may be worse than her bite.  Days after the 30-year-old songstress was photographed in an apparent argument with her rumored boyfriend, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, she seemed to lightheartedly respond to the tabloid story with a meme on her Instagram page.  “when u think u know more bout soccer 😼💪🏿 #worldcup2018,” Rihanna captioned the image of a male lion timidly backing away from the growling female feline, which somewhat resembled her passionately pointing fingers at Jameel while in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  Of course, it’s unknown if the duo were really feuding over soccer or the star was just trying to break the tension before gossip ran wild. What is clear is that Rihanna is a super fan of the tournament — she was even cheering from the stands when Germany bested Argentina 1-0 to win the 2014 World Cup.

Back in June 2017, the Ocean’s 8 star and Jameel were spotted kissing and grabbing coffee together.

"A recently-discovered photograph is turning the mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart’s 1937 disappearance on its head, leading a handful of experts to believe the celebrated aviator and women’s rights role model actually survived her final flight — and was captured by the Japanese.  Shortly after midnight on July 2, 1937, Earhart climbed into her Lockheed Electra at an airfield in Papua New Guinea and took off into the dark, muggy night.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Together with her navigator Fred Noonan, the 39-year-old pilot flew east toward Howland Island, a tiny sliver of land in the central Pacific Ocean, on the final leg of her boldest aeronautical adventure to date – circumnavigating the globe along the equator in a marathon 29,000-mile flight.  And then suddenly, she vanished.  “Gas is running low,” Earhart said in what’s believed to be her final radio broadcast to a Coast Guard cutter assisting with her navigation. “Have been unable to reach you by radio. We’re flying at 1,000 feet.”  The mystery of what happened to Earhart and Noonan has gone unanswered for 80 years.  Now Shawn Henry, a former executive assistant director of the FBI – and the History Channel – have come forward with the two-hour documentary Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence that premieres on Sunday, July 9 at 9 p.m. ET and attempts to answer this question.  Les Kinney/National Archives/HISTORY  Armed with a recently-discovered photograph purportedly taken of Earhart days after she crash-landed on a remote South Pacific atoll, Henry offers up a startling theory of a government cover-up that runs counter to the widely-accepted idea that she died after her plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean.  “This absolutely changes history,” says Henry, who led a team of investigators examining a range of evidence, including plane parts found on a remote Pacific island consistent with the aircraft Earhart was flying.  “I think we proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she survived her flight and was held prisoner by the Japanese on the island of Saipan, where she eventually died.”  Les Kinney/National Archives/HISTORY; (Graphic)Nok Acharee  The theory that the Japanese military could be responsible for the disappearance of the two aviators – who they “may have believed were American spies,” says Henry – has been floating around for decades.  But it’s the discovery of a black-and-white photograph – unearthed by retired U.S. Treasury Agent Les Kinney in 2012 and revealed for the first time in the documentary – that suddenly makes the theory more plausible, adds the former FBI boss.  ‘Top Secret’ File  A longtime Earhart buff who has spent thousands of hours combing through government records, Kinney discovered the photo in a “formerly top secret” file in the National Archives.  “It was misfiled,” he tells Henry in the documentary, referring to the photo which depicts two blurry images on a dock believed to be Noonan and Earhart – who stares out at a nearby ship with her back turned to the camera. “That’s the only reason I was able to find it.”  WATCH: Does This Photo Prove Amelia Earhart Survived Her Final Flight?  By the time Earhart embarked on her around-the-world flight, the Japanese controlled many of the islands in the South Pacific that she and Noonan were flying on this final leg of their adventure.  Kinney insists that any document that directly refers to Earhart as a Japanese prisoner was long ago “purged” from official files to hide the fact that the government knew Earhart was a prisoner and did nothing about it, including one report that totaled more than 130 pages.  NY Daily News Archive/Getty  Kinney’s undated photograph came from an Office Of Naval Intelligence file, he says, and was meticulously examined and evaluated by two of the nation’s top forensic photo analysts, using extensive recognition and proportional comparison technology.  “I can say with more than 99.7 percent confidence that the photo is authentic and untouched,” explains digital forensic analyst Doug Carner.  Facial recognition expert Kent Gibson, who compared known images of Noonan and Earhart with the individuals photographed on the dock, believes it’s “likely” they are the two lost aviators.  “There’s nothing that points me in another direction,” says Gibson, who adds that the figure believed to be Earhart has the “same prominent, athletic shoulders as Amelia” and the same “short, bobbed hair.”  Crash site investigator and former fighter pilot Dan Hampton traveled with Henry to the remote Mili atoll, where it’s believed Earhart crash-landed after flying roughly 850 miles off course during her flight to tiny Howland Island. From there she planned to refuel then continue on Hawaii.  With her fuel tanks nearly empty, he believes she was forced to land on the rocky, coral-strewn atoll in the Marshall Islands.  Islanders have long maintained that the two flyers crash-landed there. And twisted scraps of aluminum found near the atoll decades later were tested and determined to be consistent with the same grade of metal used in planes from the 1930s.  “I’ve never seen a reef you could land an airplane on until I went out there,” says Hampton, who insists he was initially skeptical of claims that Earhart survived her flight.  Vanished Without a Trace  After her disappearance, the government launched what at the time became the largest ever sea and air search. American vessels, however, weren’t allowed into the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands.  No trace of the flyers or their plane was ever found.  Days after their alleged crash landing, Henry believes Earhart and Noonan, along with their plane, were picked up by the Japanese military and taken roughly 200 miles to Jaluit Island, where Kinney’s photograph — which contains the caption: “MARSHALL ISLANDS, JALUIT ATOLL, JALUIT ISLAND. JALUIT HARBOR.” — was later snapped on the dock.  Amelia Earhart waves from the Electra before taking off from Los Angeles, Ca., on March 10, 1937. AP  Forensic analyst Carner identified the ship that the individual presumed to be Earhart appears to be staring at as the Koshu Maru, a Japanese cargo ship.  Behind the ship on a barge is an object resembling an airplane that Gibson calculated to be 38 feet long. Records show that Earhart’s Lockheed Electra measured 38.7 feet long.  The Koshu Maru is believed to have transported the flyers nearly 2,000 miles to the island of Saipan.  In the televised special Henry interviews a former islander, now in her 90s and living in California, who is described as “the last living eyewitness” to have seen Earhart and Noonan after their crash.  Henry and his team traveled to the now-crumbling, vine-choked prison cell in Saipan where they believe Earhart spent her final two years before dying in 1939, possibly from malaria or dysentery.  Not so fast, says Dorothy Cochrane, curator for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Aeronautics Department, who insists that she’s never seen any “definitive evidence” to suggest that the pair survived their final flight.  Cochrane, who as of press time had not yet seen the History Channel special, describes the idea that Earhart was taken prisoner by the Japanese as a “ridiculous theory.”  She also insists that she’s “not aware of any missing government records [on Earhart] that could be a game changer.”  Henry stands by his team’s findings, but acknowledges that Kinney’s photograph and their other discoveries open up countless new questions about Earhart and Noonan’s fate.  “It is not clear why the U.S. [government] might want to cover up what happened to Amelia,” he says.  “If in fact she was spying on the Japanese, the government may not have wanted the American public to know they put ‘America’s sweetheart’ in that situation and she was captured.”",1

"Ed Westwick.  Days after actress Kristina Cohen alleged that Gossip Girl star Ed Westwick raped her at his home, a second actress has come foward. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, former actress Aurélie Wynn (known professionally as Aurelie Marie Cao) claimed that Westwick raped her in 2014. Westwick has denied the allegations.  In her post Wynn wrote, “[A]nd like Kristina, I said no and he pushed me face down and was powerless under his weight. I was wearing a one piece bathing suit that he ripped, I was in complete shock, I am also very tiny.”  Wynn wrote that she told her boyfriend at the time, Glee actor Mark Salling, about the incident. Salling, who has since pleaded guilty for possession of child pornography, allegedly broke up with her and blamed her. She also wrote that she was encouraged by friends to stay quiet and that people would think she was “just out trying to get my 10 seconds of fame.”  Westwick responded to Cohen’s claims on Tuesday in an Instagram post saying he did not know Cohen and had never raped anybody.  A post shared by Ed Westwick (@edwestwick) on Nov 7, 2017 at 8:46am PST  Cohen filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department, which is now investigating if the “suspect forced victim to have sexual intercourse inside his residence … three years ago.”  Following Wynn’s allegations, Westwick posted a second denial on Instagram on Thursday.

"Olivia Anderson – World Stars Mag  Meghan Markle looked sunny and chic on Thursday when she attended a reception for the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge in London with Prince Harry.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a bright yellow sleeveless dress by American designer Brandon Maxwell, which could be considered a timely choice given the recent U.S. holiday.  The royal accessorized her look with earrings and nude heels. She also tucked her hair into a neat little bun.  The ensemble is a stark contrast to the more muted tones Meghan has been wearing since becoming a royal. However, Meghan’s wardrobe choices are likely intentional. After all, the duchess has attended many events with Queen Elizabeth II, and Dishaw suspected Meghan aligned her fashion choices for these events to not overshadow the importance of those events or the other members of her new family that were with her. As for the Duke of Sussex, Harry looked snazzy in a blue suit.  However, Meghan isn’t the first royal to wear the bright color. Kate Middleton has worn yellow to many occasions. Princess Diana also wore yellow to several events    Held at the Marlborough House, the event invited young leaders from across the Commonwealth to discuss how they hope to shape the future of their states by the year 2040.

"Whether you want to see Jon and Dany win it all, or you’re putting your money on Arya and her hit list, Game of Thrones fans have a hard time agreeing who should ultimately get the Iron Throne.  But one study might just have the answer—at least, the scientific answer—for who should actually rule the Seven Kingdoms. In an actual study from Macquarie University in Australia, epidemiologists (people who study the spread and distribution of disease) examined the series and found that being of noble birth, female and flexible about loyalty were the strongest characteristics for surviving to the end. Sounds like we have a Daenerys Targaryen on the throne, then (although, she doesn’t see herself there, apparently). Noble? Check. Female? Check. Wavering loyalty to the masters of Astapor who she had killed? Check.  Other possibilities: Cersei Lannister, who is also noble, female and of wavering loyalty when it serves her best (#TBT to the High Sparrow). Sansa Stark is also in the running if we’re going off this study, since she was “loyal” to the Lannisters when she married Joffrey.  The (highly technical) research noted that Game of Thrones characters who were nobles died at a lower rate than commoners, and women died at a lower rate than men. Also, switching allegiances, like the character of Tyrion Lannister does by siding with Dany, was another good strategy for outlasting rivals.  Just an excuse for the team to rewatch all seven seasons? Possibly. More fuel for our group chat debate? Definitely.

"Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married — and they may be that way for a while if they don’t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family. We’re doing really well,” Garner said previously. “It has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.”  Reps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  No one ever truly gets over losing a loved one, and Blake Shelton is no exception. He was just 14 when his older brother Richie died on Nov. 13, 1990. And, as Shelton noted in a tweet Monday, ""It changed my life forever.""  Richie was 24 when he died in a car accident in the Sheltons' home state of Oklahoma. Two years ago, Shelton sent out a message for the 25th anniversary of his loss:  Richie, who was Blake's half-brother (they shared a mother), was a passenger in a car that collided with a school bus in Ada, south of Oklahoma City.  Richie, driver Redena McManus and a 3-year-old boy, Christopher McManus, all died during or shortly after the collision, while the bus driver and passengers were uninjured, according to police reports.  The accident has clearly remained with Blake, who told 60 Minutes in 2014, ""I remember picking up the phone to call him a week after he was dead, to tell him something. I was picking up the phone to call him, to tell him something I just saw on TV or, and it was like constantly a shock to me that he was dead.""  Blake Shelton playing at TODAY's Halloween Extravaganza in New York City on Oct. 31. Getty Images  In 2011, Blake and his then-wife Miranda Lambert wrote a single called ""Over You,"" which was inspired by Richie.  Still, the two brothers had bonded despite the age difference; both shared a love of country music. ""His bedroom was right across the hallway from mine when I was little,"" Blake said in that interview. ""And he was listening to Hank Williams, Jr. or Waylon, Lynyrd Skynyrd or Bob Seeger. I just, whatever was popular really, Richie loved all music.  ""And I would be sitting there going, 'Man, that guy's my hero. That's the coolest guy. He’s my big brother.'""

"Nathan Karl Kress (born November 18, 1992) is an American actor, director, and former professional child model. Kress has been acting since the age of four and played the role of Freddie Benson on the Nickelodeon series iCarly.  Early life [ edit ]  Kress was born on November 18, 1992, in Glendale, California.[1][2] He has two brothers, Andrew and Kevin, neither of whom are involved in show business.[3][4]  Kress began his professional career at the age of four when he displayed a natural talent for memorizing and re-enacting the shows he saw on television, prompting his mother to take him to an open ""cattle call"" showcase where he was quickly signed with a talent agent.[3][4][5] Over the next three years, Kress modeled for various print advertisements, as well as performing in numerous commercials and voice-over roles; the most notable of which was his dual role as the voices of ""Easy"" and ""Tough Pup"" in the 1998 feature film Babe: Pig in the City.[2][4][5][6][7] At the age of six, he decided to take a break from acting and return to regular school, where he led a relatively ""normal"" life for the next five years until deciding to return to acting professionally at the age of eleven.[4][5][6]  Career [ edit ]  At the age of eleven, Kress was cast in the lead role as ""The Emperor"" in a school production of The Emperor's New Clothes.[4] The role rekindled his interest in performing, and at the end of his fifth grade school year, he asked his parents if he could be home-schooled so he could return to acting.[4][6] A mutual friend of Kress from school put him in touch with an agent, and after attending a summer acting ""boot camp"", Kress was soon going on real professional auditions once again.[4][5][6]  In April 2005, Kress made his first live television appearance since returning to acting in a comedy sketch on Jimmy Kimmel Live! where he played a young Simon Cowell of American Idol, and would continue to appear in various comedy sketches on the show a total of 5 times over the next year.[2][8] Kress continued to land steady work over the next two years, appearing in guest-starring roles on dramatic series such as House M.D., Standoff, and Without a Trace as well as the Disney Channel comedy series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[2][3][8][9] Kress also appeared in several short films including Pickled, Magnus, Inc., and Bag, for which he was awarded a 168 Film Festival Jury Award for his portrayal of a small-fry drug dealer with a conscience.[4][8][10] In addition to live-action roles, Kress continued to work as a voice-actor, lending his voice to various characters in the animated feature film Chicken Little and on the Nickelodeon animated series Shuriken School.[8]  In February 2006, Kress landed a small role on the popular Nickelodeon family series Drake & Josh.[2][3][4][5][11] He played the role of Toplin, a ""geeky"" kid at a birthday party with a crush on Drake and Josh's younger sister Megan Parker (played by Miranda Cosgrove) in the episode Battle of Panthatar.[3][5][8] Kress did not know it at the time, but this small role would lead to an opportunity that would catapult him to stardom.[3][4][5][12] While filming his scenes for Drake & Josh, television show creator and executive producer Dan Schneider took an interest in him and called him over to talk with him and to introduce him to some network executives.[2][4][5] At the time, Schneider was developing a new series for Nickelodeon, and was on the lookout for someone to play one of the lead roles in the untitled project, which would later become known as iCarly.[4][5][11]  The role of Toplin was similar to a character named ""Freddie"" that Schneider was looking to cast on iCarly.[3][4][5] Schneider had been so impressed with Kress' performance that he remembered him, and about 6 months after filming his small role on Drake & Josh, Kress was called in to audition for the role of ""Freddie"" shortly after his fourteenth birthday.[3][4][5] After several rounds of auditions, Kress was invited back for a screen test with Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette McCurdy and a couple of days later he was notified that he had landed the role of ""Freddie"".[4][5][11] Although iCarly would not premiere until the fall of 2007, the decision was made to cut Kress' scenes with Miranda Cosgrove out of the Drake & Josh episode that had started it all, in order to avoid any potential confusion among the young Nickelodeon viewing audience.[3][5]  On September 8, 2007, iCarly debuted on Nickelodeon and quickly became a fan favorite.[13][14] On the show, Kress plays Fredward ""Freddie"" Benson, the technical producer for the fictional web-show iCarly, which stars his character's two best friends, Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) and Samantha ""Sam"" Puckett (Jennette McCurdy).[4][5][15] His character has a crush on the main character Carly, and a feuding, bitter-sweet, love/hate relationship with Carly's best friend and web-show co-star, Sam.[4][5][12] The show became Nickelodeon's most-watched show aimed at tweens, and catapulted Kress to international fame among adolescents.[2][5][12][16][17][18] Kress' performance on the show has been characterized by one reviewer for Variety as ""sweetly nerdy"".[13]  In 2008, Kress starred in the Nickelodeon television movie Gym Teacher: The Movie.[1][4][8][17] In the movie, Kress played ""Roland"", a decidedly uncoordinated student who transfers to a new school and must be whipped into shape by his ambitious gym teacher, Dave Stewie (Christopher Meloni).[1][4][17] Later that same year, he starred as Freddie Benson in the television movie iCarly: iGo to Japan, Nickelodeon's first television film adaptation of iCarly television series.[11][16][19] Throughout 2009, Kress continued to play the role of Freddie on iCarly, but was unable to take on other projects due to Nickelodeon's decision to film both seasons two and three of the show back-to-back without the usual hiatus between filming seasons, in order to make up for the time lost during the 2008 writers strike.[5][11][12][20]  In March 2010, Kress guest-starred in the CBS television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in season 10: episode 15 titled ""Neverland"".[2][8][9][21] Kress played Mason Ward, one of two best friends of a fourteen-year-old victim with traces of blood of an inmate under his fingernails.[21] Kress told Fanlala.com of his CSI role ""It was a great opportunity to try my hand at something different. I had done scenes in dramas in the past, but other than a few semi-serious scenes on iCarly, it had been a long time since I've had the opportunity to do anything other than comedy.""[21] Later that same year, Kress returned to comedic roles, guest-starring as Prince Gabriel on the Nickelodeon comedy series True Jackson, VP, and as the voice of Ronald on the Nickelodeon animated series The Penguins of Madagascar.[8]  Kress in 2011  In 2011, Kress continued to appear in the role of Freddie Benson on the fourth season of iCarly, and in January 2011, Miranda Cosgrove began telling news sources that she was looking forward to returning to Hollywood to begin filming the fifth season of the main character of the Nickelodeon show.[22][23][24] On January 27, 2011 Cosgrove told Cleveland Live News ""We're getting ready to start the next season, right after the (Dancing Crazy) tour. I would be willing to do the show as long as people like it and as long as it works.""[22] On January 29, 2011, Reuters also reported that Cosgrove was preparing to begin filming season 5,[23] and on February 3, 2011 Cosgrove told The Middletown Press, when speaking of the show and her co-stars, Kress and Jennette McCurdy: ""I've known them since I was little. I can't wait to get back. I'm really comfortable doing [iCarly]. It's like my home away from home.""[24]  In 2014, Kress co-starred in his first major film, Into the Storm, and had a major role in the web show Video Game High School as ""The New Law"".  In 2015, he debuted as a director on Henry Danger.[25]  Personal life [ edit ]  As of February 2011 , Kress was finishing up his senior year of high school and hoped to attend UCLA, which is his father's alma mater.[3][12] While filming iCarly, Kress was tutored on the set along with his co-stars Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette McCurdy, and was home-schooled on the weekends or when on hiatus from the shooting of the show.[4][5]  Kress is a devout evangelical Christian and has said that he feels a responsibility to be a great role model to his younger fans.[4][5][11]  On May 29, 2015, Kress became engaged to his girlfriend, actress, stunt performer, and Into the Storm castmate London Elise Moore.[26] They married on November 15, 2015, in Los Angeles.[27] Their first child, Rosie Carolyn Kress, was born on December 21, 2017.[28]  Activism [ edit ]  Kress works with various charitable causes including The Big Green Help, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and The Starlight Children's Foundation.[2][29][30][31] In the summer of 2003, before returning to his acting career, Kress and his family traveled to Lithuania with the Christian missionary organization, YWAM (Youth With A Mission), where he has given money to help people build houses for the poor.[4]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Year Title Role Notes 1998 Babe: Pig in the City Tough Pup Voice role 2005 Pickled Younger brother Short film Chicken Little Additional voices 2007 Magnus, Inc.

"Getty Images  The 'Bodak Yellow' rapper was the belle of the Grammy ball  Cardi B, Literal Angel, Lived Her Best Life At The Grammys  New York's own Cardi B stepped onto the 2018 Grammy red carpet looking like a real-life angel descended from heaven — wings and everything! It's not like we would expect anything less from the Bronx rapper. After the monumental year she's had, it's only appropriate that she would #bless us all at the music industry's biggest and most star-studded night.  But Cardi's reign didn't stop at the red carpet. Although the ""Bodak Yellow"" rapper lost Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance to hip-hop titan Kendrick Lamar, she won our hearts — and, more importantly, the admiration of her peers (and Bono!). From a fire performance of ""Finesse"" with Bruno Mars to a statement-making debut at Madison Square Garden, Cardi was the belle of the ball. And reminded us all that her Cinderella story is only just beginning.  Let's take a look at some of Cardi's best moments from the night. Okurrr!",1

What's amusing to Shelton are the extremes fans have gone to when speculating about the relationship: ""Any time you see a story about us, it's either that it's a fake relationship or that we're already married. Or we're gonna get married, or she's on her second set of twins. Or, you know, I'm sneaking behind her back to eat meat. I eat meat right in front of her face!"" (Stefani is a longtime vegan.)

"When the DuckTales cast records its lines, Lin-Manuel Miranda will be in the room where it happens. The Hamilton creator/ex-star is lending his voice to the Disney XD toon series reboot that premieres this year.  The Tony- and Pulitzer-winning playwright-composer-actor will recur as fan-favorite character Gizmoduck, a Duckburg hero whose true identity is Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera. He’s a brilliant young intern working for Gyro Gearloose, the personal mad scientist of Scrooge McDuck (David Tennant). The series already has been renewed for a second season ahead of its summer launch.  After breaking out with In the Heights then breaking huge with Hamilton, Miranda has written songs for Disney’s Moana — one of which was up for an Oscar — and appeared on such TV series as Drunk History and Inside Amy Schumer. He also made a memorable appearance on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, rapping about Puerto Rico’s debt crisis.  Disney Channel  Based on the Emmy-winning 1987-90 series, DuckTales will once again take viewers along as Scrooge McDuck, his curious and mischief-making grandnephews Huey, Dewey and Louie (Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz and Bobby Moynihan, respectively), the temperamental Donald Duck (Tony Anselmo) and their trusty team of Webby Vanderquack (Kate Micucci), Launchpad McQuack (Beck Bennett) and Mrs. Beakley (Toks Olagundoye) embark on high-flying adventures around the world.  DuckTales is produced by Disney Television Animation. Matt Youngberg (Ben 10: Omniverse) serves as executive producer, with Francisco Angones as story editor and co-producer, and Sean Jimenez as art director.",1
"New Girl‘s swan song at long last has a premiere date.  Fox on Thursday announced that the seventh and final season will begin airing on Tuesday, April 10 at 9:30/8:30c. The abbreviated eight-episode run will then air uninterrupted for six weeks, leading up to the one-hour series finale on Tuesday, May 15 at 9/8c. (FWIW, your math isn’t wrong. The network will inevitably air back-to-back episodes at some point before the finale.)  As previously reported, Season 7 kicks off with a four-year time jump. After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess’ decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney).  In addition, Cece and Schmidt are now parents to three-year-old daughter Ruth, with Schmidt having made the transition to stay-at-home dad. Last but not least are Winston and Aly (recurring guest star Nasim Pedrad), who are now married and expecting their first child. Winston will also be reunited with his estranged father (Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s J.B. Smoove).  New Girl‘s farewell run will feature no shortage of guest stars. In addition to those mentioned above, One Mississippi‘s Tig Notaro has been cast in an as-yet specified role. Returning faces include Damon Wayans Jr. (Coach), David Walton (Sam), Nelson Franklin (Robby), Sam Richardson (Dunston), and Jamie Lee Curtis and Rob Reiner (as Jess’ parents).

"Presenter apologises for gags about disgraced producer after angry criticism from Rose McGowan and Asia Argento  James Corden has been forced to apologise for making jokes about Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual assault at a black-tie charity event in Los Angeles after being condemned by two of the women who have accused Weinstein of rape.  Actor Rose McGowan, who alleges that Weinstein raped her, tweeted a clip of Corden’s speech and wrote: “You motherfucking piglet.”  She said in an another tweet: “Hearing the audience’s vile roars [and] laughs show exactly what kind of Hollywood you really are.”  The Italian actor Asia Argento, who alleges that Weinstein raped her when she was 21, tweeted a video of Corden’s jokes. She added the caption: “Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him.”  Asia Argento (@AsiaArgento) Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him #amfARLosAngeles https://t.co/0SujRNCzd9  Corden has since apologised for causing offence, and says his jokes were intended to shame Weinstein, not his victims.  In a statement released on Twitter, the British star said: “To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey’s inexcusable behavior, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention.”    In footage of the event, loud groans can be heard after Corden told his audience it was a beautiful night in LA – “so beautiful, Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage”.  Corden said: “I don’t know whether that groan was that you liked that joke or you don’t like that joke. If you don’t like that joke you should probably leave now.”  Emboldened, he continued: “It has been weird this week hasn’t it, watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water. Ask any of the women who watched him take a bath … it’s weird watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water.  “Harvey Weinstein wanted to come tonight but he’ll settle for whatever potted plant is closest.”  That joke prompted more groans. “Oh come on!” said Corden.  McGowan also said that CBS, who broadcast Corden’s Late Late Show should donate to a women’s charity, or they too “support rape culture”.  Corden, the host of The Late Late Show, was master of ceremonies at the gala for amfAR, a foundation for Aids research, on Friday evening. The footage of his jokes was posted on Twitter by a Hollywood Reporter journalist, Chris Gardner.  Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) Straight out gate, host @JKCorden with Harvey Weinstein jokes. Too soon? Some laughs, some groans #amfARLosAngeles pic.twitter.com/nx88w5UwUe  Julia Roberts was given a special award for courage during the event while the guests included Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn, Melanie Griffith, Sean Penn and Coldplay’s Chris Martin as a surprise guest performer.  For many on Twitter, Corden’s jokes were far too soon. “James Corden’s ‘jokes’ about the Weinstein situation are disgusting. Sexual harassment is never funny. Ever,” wrote one user.  “James Corden just embarrassed every #Brit in #LA. Whack jokes about #Weinstein & #sexualassault are no joke,” wrote another.  Harvey Weinstein: Scotland Yard investigates further sexual assault claims Read more  Weinstein was executive producer of the 2013 film One Chance, a biopic in which Corden played the Britain’s Got Talent winner Paul Potts. It was Corden who suggested Take That’s Gary Barlow to Weinstein when he needed to change the music on his stage musical project Finding Neverland.  The condemnation of Corden for making jokes followed the condemnation of Saturday Night Live over a week ago for not making jokes and for ignoring the story altogether. But on Saturday Weinstein did feature. The show included a sketch featuring a “women’s roundtable” of actors at a film festival. On the subject of whisper networks, one said: “We had a secret code among us actresses to warn each other about creeps. The code was: ‘He raped me.’ And if the men were listening, they tuned us right out.”  In the regular “weekend update” section, the comedian Michael Che said: “It’s so easy to make jokes about a guy who looks like this,” pointing to a photo. “He looks like chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair.”  Weinstein said he has made a mistake, Che continued, but Weinstein’s actions were not a mistake. “You assaulted dozens of women. That’s not a mistake, that’s a full season of Law & Order.”",1

"According to US magazine Star, 50-year-old Julia is devastated after months of meetings between herself and Richard, 68, petered out and he’s now consumed with his much younger girlfriend.  Although for years the timing was never right, 'Julia and Richard are undeniably drawn to each other and always have been,' claims a source. So far that has always meant being in the friend zone.  The Hollywood pair are said to have reached out to each other in 2015 when they were both going through a tough time – Julia rumoured to have begun a trial separation with husband Danny Moder late last year.    ‘They both were going through a rough time and poured their hearts out to each other,’ continues the insider, who notes that Richard was going through a messy divorce from second wife, actress Carey Lowell.    ‘Their heart-to-hearts eventually led to discreet dinner dates in L.A, sometimes in private restaurant dining rooms, where they’d be left uninterrupted and could stay past closing hours.’    However, the American Gigolo star eventually got back together with much younger girlfriend Alejandra Silva, 35 – with the pair even rumoured to have secretly eloped with during a trip to France .    ‘Julia spent literally decades loving this man and they have an intense, powerful connection,’ claims the insider to Star of their friendship.    'Of course, she’ll be the first to congratulate Richard, but deep down it’s got to be heartbreaking to see her soul mate commit to someone else.'  Neither party has commented on Star‘s claims.",0
"Seeing the couple back together in October 2017 was exciting for the majority of us that have always dreamed of their reunion... but if we're being honest with ourselves, we always knew they're just not good together.  Selena's friends and family insisted on that too, and it looks like she finally listened to them because she's ended things for good.  ""Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship,"" a source tells Us Weekly. ""Like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.  ""She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,"" the source continues. ""She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.""  Good for you Sel!  After the pair went on a break earlier this year, Justin was spotted on several occasions with model Baskin Champion, which pretty much proved that he hadn't changed one bit since they began dating in 2009.  RIP Jelena.",0

"This marks the royal’s first official public appearance on his own since the wedding. We have learned that Prince Harry headed for a ‘private visit’ to Pitseng, Lesotho in South Africa without his new bride Meghan Markle.  Apparently, Harry is set to be in attendance at the opening of a brand new dining hall at the Phelisanong Children’s Centres on behalf of the charity he co-founded with close pal Prince Seeiso back in 2006.  One spokesperson for the charity Sentebale (‘forget me not’) released the following statement: ‘The Duke was on a private visit to view the work of Sentebale at a camp for helpless children and youngsters, as well as other projects funded by the same charity. During this private working visit to Sentebale, the Duke visited one of its community-led partners for the opening of a brand new dining hall. This was funded by the charity and is set to provide a space for kids to eat together and have indoor space to play.’  Meanwhile, on the charity’s official webpage it can be read that ‘Sentebale supports the mental health as well as the well-being of kids and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana. Our programs of education and care provide the tools and knowledge that this vulnerable generation needs to live long, happy, healthy lives in the future.’  According to Kensington Palace, Harry will also be part of a board meeting of a conservation charity named Africa Parks, that he is an advocate for.  However, it turns out that his little trip is set to end pretty soon as he also has to be there for Queen’s Young Leaders at Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday.

"The 'Star Trek' icon denies a claim by Scott R. Brunton, who says he was groped at the actor's Los Angeles condo.  A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable.  ""This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,"" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. ""It is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up. I have been telling it for years, but I am suddenly very nervous telling it.""  Brunton says he was living in Hollywood in 1981, working as a waiter and beginning a career as a commercial actor and model when he met a 43- or 44-year-old Takei one evening at Greg's Blue Dot bar. The men exchanged numbers and would call one another from time to time as well as run into each other at clubs, Brunton says. When Brunton broke up with his then-boyfriend, he spoke with Takei. ""He said, 'Let me know what your new number is' and I did. And not long after we broke up and I moved out, George called me,"" Brunton recalls.  Takei, as Brunton tells it, invited him to dinner and the theater. ""He was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,"" Brunton says. ""He was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve.""  The two men went back to the actor's condo for a drink the same night. ""We have the drink and he asks if I would like another,"" Brunton recalls. ""And I said sure. So, I have the second one, and then all of a sudden, I begin feeling very disoriented and dizzy, and I thought I was going to pass out. I said I need to sit down and he said sit over here and he had the giant yellow beanbag chair. So I sat down in that and leaned my head back and I must have passed out.""  ""The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,"" Brunton says. ""I came to and said, 'What are you doing?!' I said, 'I don't want to do this.' He goes, 'You need to relax. I am just trying to make you comfortable. Get comfortable.' And I said, 'No. I don't want to do this.' And I pushed him off and he said, 'OK, fine.' And I said I am going to go and he said, 'If you feel you must. You're in no condition to drive.' I said, 'I don't care I want to go.' So I managed to get my pants up and compose myself and I was just shocked. I walked out and went to my car until I felt well enough to drive home, and that was that.""  THR spoke to four longtime friends of Brunton — Norah Roadman, Rob Donovan, Stephen Blackshear and Jan Steward — who said that he had confided in them about the Takei encounter years ago.  Takei's rep, Julia Buchwald, told THR, ""George is traveling in Japan and Australia and not reachable for comment."" Takei, now 80, rose to fame playing Hikaru Sulu on the original Star Trek television series. He is also an author and activist and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights.  In a series of tweets and in a Facebook post Saturday morning, Takei denied the allegations.  ""The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do,"" he said. ""Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.""  Brunton claims that he met up with Takei years after the incident in Portland, Brunton's current home, while the actor was there on a book tour. ""I wanted to see him,"" Brunton says. ""I always wanted to ask him — I just felt really betrayed. I thought I was a friend and here I am later, just another piece of meat. So I called him up at the hotel — I figured out which hotel he was at — and he said 'Hi, Scott. I remember you.' I wanted to ask him why. We met for coffee, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It was just too uncomfortable.""  Brunton says he considered going to the media with the story for years, but he assumed no one would take him seriously. ""Who's going to believe me? It's my word against his,"" he says.  Brunton's reasoning changed after the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and specifically when Takei spoke out regarding allegations leveled against Kevin Spacey.  On Oct. 29, Anthony Rapp, an actor starring in the latest Star Trek series, claimed to BuzzFeed News that Spacey sexually assaulted him while he was a minor in 1986. Spacey later apologized and came out as gay in response. ""When power is used in a non-consensual situation, it is a wrong,"" Takei said of the Spacey claim in a statement to THR on Oct. 30. ""For Anthony Rapp, he has had to live with the memory of this experience of decades ago. For Kevin Spacey, who claims not to remember the incident, he was the older, dominant one who had his way. Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight — that is a deflection. They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.""  Brunton says he found Takei's response infuriating. ""I don't want anything from him but an apology,"" he says. ""I am sure he'll disown all this, I don't know, maybe not.""  Friends,    I'm writing to respond to the accusations made by Scott R. Bruton. I want to assure you all that I am as shocked and bewildered at these claims as you must feel reading them. /1 — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 11, 2017  The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now.

"“Push your locks away with the headband of the day!” That’s the song John Legend has been singing daily for days — And Chrissy Teigen is showing exactly how to put those lyrics into practice. The mom of two has been on vacation in Bali for the last three weeks with her Grammy-winning husband and their children Luna and Miles. And it seems Teigen brought an entire suitcase full of headbands — at least enough to create a mini series: “Headband of the Day.”  The Instagram Story videos are only a few seconds long and feature a little ditty Legend wrote all about headbands. The clips began with Teigen showing off her headband choice of the day solo and quickly evolved to a motif in which the model hides her new accessory while husband sings, ending with a reveal. The lyrics are simple yet informative, “Headband of the day. It’s the headband of the day. Push you locks away with the headband of the day!”  Scroll through to see the variety of headbands Teigen has worn so far — no two are the same! And warning: You won’t be able to get the song out of your head!",1
"Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova have welcomed twins, according to TMZ. The singer and former tennis pro are first-time parents. E! Online also confirmed the news.  Kournikova, 36, reportedly gave birth to a baby boy, Nicholas, and girl, Lucy, over the weekend in Miami. The couple hadn’t announced they were expecting. Representatives for Iglesias and Kournikova did not return HuffPost’s request for comment.  Despite making themselves mighty comfortable in that public bathroom for Iglesias’ “Escape” music video all those years ago, the pop star and former tennis pro are famously private and rarely appear in public together.  The two have been together since 2001. While Kournikova sported some serious bling on her ring finger in a snap from 2016, they’ve never confirmed that they are married.

"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also",0

"As they prepare to welcome a child together in the wake of ongoing cheating allegations, Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson‘s future together is unclear.  “This is supposed to be the most joyous time in her life and it’s been ruined and that’s probably what hurts most of all,” a family source tells PEOPLE about Kardashian, 33, who is due with her first child — a daughter — with Thompson, 27, any day now.  On Tuesday, photos and videos surfaced of the NBA player allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at an N.Y.C. lounge over the weekend. TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.  Despite the allegations of infidelity — a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is “a serial cheater” — the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.  “She’s a hopeless romantic and she’ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She’s having a child with Tristan, and she’s going to try to rebuild this,” the source says.  Adds the source: “Khloé could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That’s actually even worse.”  Prior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom  “Khloé spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That’s not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It’s just not. And Khloé can’t lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,” the source says.  RELATED VIDEO: Did Khloé Kardashian’s Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?  “The thing about Khloé, though, is she’s a big believer in knowing someone’s back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he’d been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She’s got a big heart — too big sometimes,” the source shares.  Thompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson’s first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.

She might still believe that, honestly.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  With the baby’s arrival imminent, Kardashian has been nesting in Cleveland with the NBA player. A source previously told PEOPLE she planned on giving birth there, and her famous family would fly in, including mother Kris Jenner, who is already in Ohio with Kardashian.  While her future with Thompson remains unknown, the Good American jeans founder is focusing her attention on her unborn daughter.  “The only thing Khloe can do now is focus on her baby,” the source says.”What’s happened over the last 24 hours changes a lot of things, but it doesn’t change everything: It doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom, already loves her baby so much, and that soon her dream is going to come true.”  “She can’t wait to meet her little girl, can’t wait to hold her,” says the insider, adding, “and so for right now, the focus is just on getting to that day as safely and healthily as possible.”",0
"Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress, film producer, and businesswoman. She is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood—as of 2017 , her net worth is estimated at $200 million—and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012. She has also been included on magazine lists of the world's most beautiful women.  The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began her career at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me. Aniston rose to fame portraying Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), for which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards. The character was widely popular while the series aired and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television. Aniston has since played lead roles in numerous comedies and romantic comedies. Her box office hits include Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We're the Millers (2013), each of which grossed over $200 million in worldwide receipts. Her most critically acclaimed roles were in Office Space (1999); The Good Girl (2002), for which she was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award; Friends with Money (2006); and the drama Cake (2014), for which she received nominations for the Golden Globe, Critics' Choice and SAG awards.  Aniston co-founded production company Echo Films in 2008. Divorced from actor Brad Pitt, to whom she was married for five years, she is separated from actor Justin Theroux, who she married in 2015.  Early life  Aniston was born on February 11, 1969 in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks,[1][2] the daughter of Greek-born actor John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow.[1] One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louise Grieco, was an Arbëreshë immigrant.[3][4] Her mother's other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek.[5] Aniston has two half-brothers, John Melick, her older maternal half-brother, and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother.[1] Aniston's godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father's best friends.[1][6]  As a child she moved to New York City.[1] Despite her father's television career she was discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school.[7] Her parents split up when she was nine years old.[8]  Having discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school,[8] Aniston enrolled in Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society.[9] Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.[10] She was in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.[11]  Career  Beginnings (1988–1993)  Aniston first worked in Off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker's Grave,[1] and supported herself with part-time jobs which included working as a telemarketer, waitress, and bike messenger.[1] In 1988, she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem,[12] and moved back to Los Angeles.[13]  She obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990, and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993).[14] A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role,[15] and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.[16]  Aniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series, The Edge and Muddling Through,[17] and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head, and Burke's Law.[18][19]  Friends (1994–2004)  Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for Friends,[20][17] a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producer originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[21] but Courteney Cox was considered more suitable. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down to do Friends.[22] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004.  The program was successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers. Her character was widely popular and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television.[23][24] The actress received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress.[25] She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness World Book of Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends.[26] Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple were frequently voted as television's favorite couple in polls and magazines.[27]  Following a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She's the One.[28] Aniston's first starring vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), in which she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success,[29] and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.[30] In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection,[31] and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space.[32]  She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America.[33] Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough:  Sfter languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.[34]  Aniston's biggest commercial success to date is the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God himself for one week.[35] With a worldwide box office gross of $484 million,[36][37] the film was the fifth-highest-grossing big screen production of the year.[38] Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly-wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004), opposite Ben Stiller,[39] which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million in its opening weekend;[40] it eventually made $172 million globally.[41]  Continued film success (2005–2013)  In 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller Derailed, and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy Rumor Has It.[42][43] Both films were moderate box office hits.[44][45] Aniston took on the role of a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in the independent drama Friends with Money (2006), which received a limited release.[46]  Her next film was the romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006), alongside Vince Vaughn, in which she starred as one half of a couple having a complicated split when both refuse to move out of the pair's recently purchased home.

He further stated, ""Aniston makes you believe in Claire's pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. ... It's a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.""[94] For her portrayal, Aniston was nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[95][96]  Horrible Bosses in 2011.

She's funny in every way.""[98] She was ""one of the film's few bright spots"" for Lou Lumenick from The New York Post.[99]  Aniston starred as the recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy Mother's Day (2016), and opposite Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson.[100] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[101] In 2016, she voiced a workaholic and overprotective mother in the animated film Storks, alongside Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer,[102] which was released to mostly positive reviews, while it grossed over $183.4 million with a $70 million budget.[103][104] Her last 2016 film role was that of a frigidly cold head honcho of a company in the comedy Office Christmas Party, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck and opposite Jason Bateman and Kate McKinnon.[105] It made $114.5 million globally.[106]  In The Yellow Birds, a war drama directed by Alexandre Moors, Aniston portrayed the mother of a deceased soldier, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan, Jack Huston, and Toni Collette.[107] While she said she does not ""normally gravitate toward being in war films"", she made an exception because the film was ""written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced"".[108] The film, first presented during the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018.[109] The Los Angeles Times wrote in its review: ""Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances"".[110]  In December 2018, Netflix released the musical comedy Dumplin', with Aniston as executive producer and star—marking her first project for a streaming service.[111] That year her first original Netflix projects were also announced: Murder Mystery, a mystery comedy that reunites her with Adam Sandler,[112] and First Ladies, a film about the first lesbian President of the United States, with Tig Notaro as her wife.[113] Aniston and Reese Witherspoon will star in the morning show drama series Top of the Morning for Apple.

"Kim Kardashian typically keeps her hair sleek and straight, either down or in an Ariana-adjacent ponytail, but on Monday night, she showed up to the 2018 CFDA Fashion Awards wearing — gasp — waves. And not just any waves: these were seriously dense waves that are apparently just her natural hair texture, but enhanced.  According to a press release, the uncharacteristic hairdo was the brainchild of Color Wow Global Creative Director Chris Appleton. To achieve the look, he first prepped Kardashian's hair with Color Wow Brass Banned Correct & Perfect Mousse for Dark Hair for texture and definition, which he further added by blowing the hair with a diffuser. After that, he applied the Color Wow Pop & Lock Gloss Treatment to make things shiny.  The final steps involve a $200 curling iron and a hair band or ponytail holder. The curling iron in question is the ghd Curve Classic Curl Iron, which Appleton used to curl random sections of hair for even more defined waves. To complete the look, according to the press release, he pulled Kardashian's hair into a high pony, softening the look by pulling out the edges and wrapping hair around the ponytail's base.  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  Jared Siskin/Getty Images  Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty Images  Kardashian apparently chose the perfect night to switch things up, because she later won the CFDA's first-ever Influencer Award. ""I'm kind of shocked that I'm winning a fashion award when I'm naked most of the time,"" she joked during her acceptance speech. In the speech, she also reminisced about an ex-publicist who told her she'd never land the cover of a fashion magazine and how she got revenge by sending her an autographed copy of her Vogue cover.  According to Glamour, she was presented with the award by Busy Philipps, who recognized how Kardashian has turned being social media famous into the ""ultimate symbol of female empowerment."" ""You are the influencer's influencer,"" Philipps said in the speech, according to Glamour. ""Your impact on how women dress and what they want to look like has had real cultural significance.""

"Director of the film ""Kill Bill: Volume 1,"" Quentin Tarantino, left, and cast member Uma Thurman arrive at the premiere of the film Monday, Sept. 29, 2003, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles. Director Robert Rodriquez, right, looks on.  Quentin Tarantino is revealing new details about what happened on and off the ""Kill Bill"" set.  In a new interview, the Hollywood director spoke out about Uma Thurman's experiences working on the movie and reveals he was aware that the actress was going to come forward and share serious allegations with the New York Times.  ""I knew that the piece was happening. Uma and I had talked about it, for a long period of time, deciding how she was going to do it. She wanted clarity on what happened in that car crash, after all these years. She asked, could I get her the footage? I had to find it, 15 years later,"" he shared with Deadline. ""I didn't think we were going to be able to find it. It was clear and it showed the crash and the aftermath. I was very happy to get it to Uma.""  When speaking to the NYT, Thurman recalled being injured in a ""Kill Bill"" car stunt, which she said the director pressured her to perform herself. She said she was left with a ""permanently damaged neck"" and ""screwed-up knees.""  Join the Movement: Click here to donate to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund  On Monday afternoon, Thurman shared the video on Instagram to her 743,000 followers. ""The circumstances of this event were negligent to the point of criminality. I do not believe though with malicious intent,"" she captioned the post. ""Quentin Tarantino, was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so I could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible.""  i post this clip to memorialize it’s full exposure in the nyt by Maureen Dowd. the circumstances of this event were negligent to the point of criminality. i do not believe though with malicious intent. Quentin Tarantino, was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so i could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible. he also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and i am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage. THE COVER UP after the fact is UNFORGIVABLE. for this i hold Lawrence Bender, E. Bennett Walsh, and the notorious Harvey Weinstein solely responsible. they lied, destroyed evidence, and continue to lie about the permanent harm they caused and then chose to suppress. the cover up did have malicious intent, and shame on these three for all eternity. CAA never sent anyone to Mexico. i hope they look after other clients more respectfully if they in fact want to do the job for which they take money with any decency. A post shared by Uma Thurman (@ithurman) on Feb 5, 2018 at 10:15am PST  Thurman added, ""He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and I am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage.""  During his lengthy interview with Deadline, Tarantino admitted that the car crash ""is one of the biggest regrets of my life.""  Uma Thurman's Best Roles  ""I figured that eventually [the video clip] would be used whenever she had her big piece. Also, there was an element of closure. She had been denied it, from Harvey Weinstein, being able to even see the footage. I wanted to deliver it to her, so she could look at it,"" Tarantino explained. ""So she could see it and help her with her memory of the incident.""  E! News has reached out to Weinstein's team for comment about Tarantino's latest interview. When Thurman first posted her Instagram with the footage from ""Kill Bill,"" his spokesperson released a statement denying her allegations that there was a ""cover up"" involved.  ""Harvey has tremendous affection for Uma Thurman nevertheless he denies these allegations. He did not give instructions to destroy the vehicle or orchestrate a cover-up and this is the first time he has learned that Ms. Thurman had any issues regarding the handling of her accident. In fact, she continued working with Mr. Weinstein on three more films, including 'The War with Grandpa' which was scheduled to be released this year,"" the statement read. ""Ms. Thurman has reported in the past that that Mr. Weinstein personally came on set during the filming of the scene where she was being buried alive, concerned with her well-being, he demanded that they reconfigure the shot to her approval so that she felt more comfortable.""  The statement continued, ""We understand that members of the production team have stated to individuals in the media that Mr. Weinstein had nothing to do with the aftermath of the crash. Mr. Weinstein wishes Ms. Thurman would have spoken to him at the time to express her concerns and would like for her to provide any additional details so that he can assist in closing and repairing this chapter of her life. Once again, he is remorseful and regrets making a pass at her in England.""  Every Star Who Has Spoken Out Against Harvey Weinstein Amid His Sexual Harassment Allegations  One of the biggest headlines that came out of Thurman's interview with the NYT is when the publication details an allegation that in ""Kill Bill,"" Tarantino allegedly spit in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.  Uma Thurman Says Harvey Weinstein Assaulted Her Years Ago, He Denies It  When asked about the portion of the piece, Tarantino offered his perspective.  ""Let me address that. According to Uma...You notice there are not quotes around that. Uma didn't share that with [the NYT author] Maureen Dowd. Maureen Dowd interviewed other people on the set who mentioned it to her. If you notice, all that choking and spitting stuff is not in quotes from Uma. It's part of Maureen Dowd's prose. For some reason there is a lot of hay being made out of this. Which I don't understand, at all. You've seen movies where somebody spits in somebody's face?"" he explained. ""Well, that's what this was. A scene where somebody spits in somebody's face. I can explain why I did exactly what I did, but my question is, what's the f--king problem?""  He continued, ""I asked Uma. I said, I think I need to do it. I'll only do it twice, at the most, three times. But I can't have you laying here, getting spit on, again and again and again, because somebody else is messing it up by missing. It is hard to spit on people, as it turns out.""  Tarantino is quick to admit that the crash in particular had an effect on his relationship with Uma for many years. While they still communicated, the director said a ""trust was broken"" after the incident.  ""Me and Uma had our issues about the crash. She blamed me for the crash and she had a right to blame me for the crash. I didn't mean to do it. I talked her into getting in the car, I assured her the road was safe. And it wasn't. The car might even have been dubious too even if I didn't know that then. We had our issues about it,"" he shared. ""We weren't estranged. But we were over each other for a couple of years.""  He added, ""We have a long complicated history. We have been dealing with it for 22 years. We're both one of the closest people in each other's lives.""

Early life [ edit ]  Lisa Kudrow was born in Los Angeles, California, to Nedra S. (née Stern, born 1934), a travel agent, and Lee N. Kudrow (born 1933), a physician who specialized in the treatment of headaches.[3] She has an older sister, Helene Marla (born 1955), and an older brother, Santa Monica neurologist David B. Kudrow (born 1957). Kudrow was raised in a middle-class Jewish family and had a Bat Mitzvah ceremony.[4][5] Her ancestors emigrated from Belarus, Germany, Hungary and Poland,[6] and some of them lived in the village of Ilya, in the Minsk area. Kudrow's paternal grandparents were David Kudrow (born in Mogilev, Belarus) and Gertrude Farberman (born in Ilya, Belarus).[6] Her paternal great-grandmother, Mera Mordejovich, was murdered in Ilya during the Holocaust. Her paternal grandmother immigrated to Brooklyn, where her father grew up.[7][8]  Kudrow attended Portola Middle School in Tarzana, California. In 1979, at the age of 16, she underwent rhinoplasty to reduce the size of her nose.[9] She graduated from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles where then N.W.A. member Ice Cube also attended. Kudrow received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology from Vassar College, intending to follow in her father's footsteps and research headaches.[citation needed] Kudrow worked on her father's staff for eight years while breaking into acting, earning a research credit on his study on the comparative likelihood of left-handed individuals developing cluster headaches.[10]  Career [ edit ]  1989–1994: Early career [ edit ]  At the urging of her brother's childhood friend, comedian Jon Lovitz,[4] she began her comedic career as a member of The Groundlings, an improv and sketch comedy school in Los Angeles. Kudrow has credited Cynthia Szigeti, her improv teacher at The Groundlings, for changing her perspective on acting, calling her ""the best thing that happened, on so many levels.""[11][12] Briefly, Kudrow joined with Conan O'Brien and director Tim Hillman in the short-lived improv troupe Unexpected Company.[13] She was also the only regular female member of the Transformers Comedy Troupe.[14] She played a role in an episode of the NBC sitcom Cheers.[15] She tried out for Saturday Night Live in 1990, but the show chose Julia Sweeney instead.[16] She had a recurring role as Kathy Fleisher in three episodes of season one of the Bob Newhart sitcom Bob (CBS, 1992–1993), a role she played after taking part in the memorable series finale of Newhart's previous series Newhart.[17] Prior to Friends, she appeared in at least two produced network pilots: NBC's Just Temporary (also known as Temporarily Yours) in 1989, playing Nicole; and CBS' Close Encounters (also known as Matchmaker) in 1990, playing a Valley girl.[3]  Kudrow was cast to play the role of Roz Doyle in Frasier, but the role was re-cast with Peri Gilpin during the taping of the pilot episode. Kudrow said in 2000 that when rehearsals started, ""I knew it wasn't working. I could feel it all slipping away, and I was panicking, which only made things worse.""[4] Her first recurring television role was Ursula Buffay, the eccentric waitress on the NBC sitcom Mad About You. Kudrow would reprise the character on the NBC sitcom Friends, in which Kudrow co-starred as massage therapist Phoebe Buffay, Ursula's twin sister.[18]  1994–2004: Breakthrough [ edit ]  For her starring role as Phoebe on Friends (NBC, 1994–2004) Kudrow won the 1998 Emmy Award[19] for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. According to the Guinness Book of World Records (2005), Kudrow and co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox became the highest paid TV actresses of all time, earning $1 million per episode for the ninth and tenth seasons of Friends.[20] During her tenure on Friends Kudrow appeared in multiple comedic films such as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Hanging Up, Marci X, Dr. Dolittle 2, Analyze This and its sequel Analyze That, and dramatic films, such as Wonderland and The Opposite of Sex.  She also guest starred on numerous television series during Friends, including The Simpsons, Hope and Gloria, King of the Hill, and hosting Saturday Night Live.  2004–present: Post-Friends [ edit ]  Kudrow starred as protagonist Valerie Cherish on the single-season HBO series The Comeback (premiered June 5, 2005), about a has-been sitcom star trying for a comeback. She also served as co-creator, writer, and executive producer. The series was cancelled by HBO before being renewed for a second season nearly a decade after being originally cancelled. Kudrow received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on The Comeback.[21]  Kudrow serves as the executive producer for the American version of the UK television series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which celebrities trace their family trees. The subjects of the first series included Kudrow herself, in which it was discovered her great-grandmother died in the Holocaust.[22][23]  Kudrow co-created an improvised comedy web series, Web Therapy on Lstudio.com. The improv series, which launched online in 2008, has earned several Webby nominations and one Outstanding Comedic Performance Webby for Kudrow, who plays therapist of unspecified credentials Fiona Wallice.

"If you've spent hours in the gym hoping to squat your way to a Kardashian-esque butt, you've probably wondered if there's a quicker and easier way.  Turns out butt augmentation is one of the fastest growing cosmetic surgical procedures performed in the country, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Derrière implants increased by 18 percent between 2015 and 2016, while fat grafting procedures (where they literally inject more fat into your keister) jumped 26 percent during the same period.  In total, 20,673 butt augmentation procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2017, per soon-to-be-published data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andrew Ordon, M.D., a co-host on The Doctors, even declared 2017 ""the year of the rear.""  Yet Ordon admits not all his patients are happy after having these procedures—and a few have even come back requesting reversals. So is butt augmentation really worth it?  There are a few things you should know before springing for this pricey procedure:  Fat Grafting Is The Most Popular (And Best!) Method  Getty Images  Fat grafting is the most popular method of butt augmentation. With fat grafting, also called the Brazilian butt lift, the doctor starts by performing liposuction—removing fat from an area where it’s not wanted, like the stomach, thighs, or upper back, and injects it into the buttocks. Results are immediately visible, but you won’t see the final product until a year after surgery; it takes time for the body to form new blood vessels and truly incorporate the grafted fat.  There are risks like blood clots, sensation changes, and fat embolism (when fat is released into the blood stream), but most experts advocate fat grafting as the number-one option for butt augmentation. It has a low risk of infection and, if you do gain weight down the line, it will grow with you, says Alexes Hazen, M.D., a plastic surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The average cost of fat grafting is $4,356, per the ASPS; most health insurance companies won't cover it.  You Can Also Opt For Silicone Implants  Getty Images  Very thin patients who don’t have enough fat for liposuction might not be eligible for fat grafting, and these are the women who make good candidates for implants, says Mark Mofid, M.D., a plastic surgeon in La Jolla, California, and an ASAPS member.  Butt implants require a multi-hour outpatient surgery in which a surgeon inserts silicone implants into your tuchus. On butt-implant delivery day, your surgeon will make an incision within the vertical butt crease and then slide silicone implants either into or above the gluteal muscle on each side. Placement technique varies among doctors, but intramuscular implants are ideal, says Mofid.  “Most of the patients who have had implants and are unhappy with them have on-top-of-the-muscle implants,” Mofid says. “That’s just not a great place for an implant to be. Those implants sag over time and kind of look like gumdrops on the buttocks, as opposed to a much more natural look.”  Surgeons typically use the approach they’re most comfortable with, so if you’re considering the procedure, ask your doctor what type of placement he or she uses, he recommends. And, FYI, butt implants cost around $4,860, according to 2016 statistics from ASPS; most health insurance doesn’t cover cosmetic surgery or resulting complications.  The Bigger The Implant, The Bigger The Risk  Getty Images  Most women go into the initial consultation with an idea of what kind of butt they’re trying to achieve, but Mofid cautions against going too large. He says he won’t do implants bigger than 350 cubic centimeters, which equals roughly one and a half cups of fluid—even when patients beg, as they sometimes do—because it’s too “fraught with risks.”  Large implants have higher rates of incisions that split open post-surgery and implants that shift around under the skin. (But more on that next.)  In 2013, Mofid co-authored a study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery that analyzed the experience of 2,226 people who received butt implants. Among all patients, 848—or 38 percent—reported complications.  The most common side effect reported in the PRS study was incisional separation (7.9 percent of patients)—“people bend and stoop and the incision can separate,” Mofid says. About 5 percent of patients needed an implant revision, and 4.2 percent experienced pain that lasted more than 12 weeks. Nearly 4 percent developed seromas, which means fluid builds up under the skin, and 3.6 percent had minor infection that didn’t require the implants to be removed. Implant removal was necessary in 3.8 percent of patients for reasons like major infection, chronic pain, and chronic seromas, according to the study findings.  Hazen says that plastic surgeons have mixed feelings about butt augmentation, but she’s not a fan. “Just anatomically where they go—you’re sitting on it all the time,” Hazen says. “It’s hard to imagine that it would be comfortable.”  Switch up your squat with these 20 variations that will help you tone your butt:  ​  Recovery is rough—No matter the method  Getty Images  Whether you opt for fat grafting or implants, you can't sit or lie on your back for three weeks post butt-augmentation, says Mofid, which generally rules out things like work and school (and maybe comfortable sleeping). “Normal life is put on hold,” he says. “You’ve got to be committed to this operation. It’s not for the faint of heart.”  If you’re determined to go through with the procedure, vet your surgeon and facility carefully. Check prospective doctors’ websites to see before and after photos of their patients, and talk to other women who’ve gotten implants, Hazen suggests. Always opt for a board-certified plastic surgeon who has ample experience, and be sure to ask questions like how your butt will look over time, whether you’re a good candidate for the surgery and what the options are if you’re dissatisfied with the outcome.  And don’t be lured by unscrupulous doctors or facilities in foreign countries hawking cheaper procedures. “Don’t cheap out and go someplace because it’s inexpensive,” Hazen says. “This is your body, this is forever, it’s important, so go to somebody good. You want an accredited facility, not just the back of some guy’s office.”  Whatever you do, don't get silicone injections  Getty Images  In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against using silicone injections for purposes like body contouring. The warning was issued in response to an increase in cases of patients receiving illegal silicone injections from unlicensed medical professionals in private homes or hotels. Often called ""pumping parties,"" these services are marketed as a cheaper alternative to plastic surgery.  The risks of illegal silicone injections are even worse than you'd think: Loose silicone—as opposed to silicone used as enclosed implants—can be dangerous and even fatal; injections can cause disfigurement or significant scarring. “It should be uniformly condemned,” Mofid says. “There’s no place for it in medicine—virtually 100 percent of patients over their lifetime will develop problems.”  Squats might actually be your best option  Getty Images  Surgery offers the lure of a quick fix, but it’s risky, expensive, and, well, extreme. Ordon reminds those who crave a larger posterior that they can get one naturally. He recommends performing exercises that target the glutes, such as squats and leg raises. In short, augmentation might seem like a quick fix—but a butt workout is probably still the best way.",1
"At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites — including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. “Gwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,” a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. “Blake sang a lot in her direction.” At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: “Their dog was having puppies and they couldn’t wait to get home!”  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. “Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,” an insider shares in the new issue. “Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.”  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it’s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is “absolutely devoted” to Gwen’s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: “Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.”  Shelton’s devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. “Blake has always wanted children,” explains a friend. “And he’s great with Gwen’s kids, which prompted them wanting their own.”  The No Doubt singer was all in — but not anymore. “Not because of a change in her love for Blake,” explains the source, “but because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.” The country star is on board with her thoughts. “He is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,” shares the insider.  With no baby, they’ve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, “Gwen is very traditional and wouldn’t want to be pregnant without being married.”  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. “Their relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,” explains the source. “The need to get married and have kids isn’t the priority it once was.”  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an “easy, effortless love” together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton’s Oklahoma ranch — something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? “Gwen loves hanging out with Blake’s friends and wives,” says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples’ trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.

"The only budget Ted Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposalRubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul’s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut.""""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.We rate this statement Mostly False.",1
"Mac Miller is finally sharing how he felt when his ex-girlfriend Ariana Grande got engaged to Pete Davidson.  The ""Missed Calls"" rapper and Grande split back in May after about two years together. By late June, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star had confirmed his engagement to Grande during an interview with late-night host Jimmy Fallon.  Miller, 26, admitted that the situation was ""strange.""  ""Like the whole thing is a little strange, but it's not negative. It's just a part of something that's going to continue to help make me who I am,"" the rapper told Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1. ""It's all positive energy. I am happy for her in moving forward with her life, just as I'm sure she is with me.""  Scott Dudelson/Getty Images  Miller said that his failed love story is ""not that unique.""  He added, ""I was in love with somebody. We were together for two years. We worked through good times, bad times, stress and everything else. And then it came to an end and we both moved on. And it's that simple, you know?""  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  The rapper said he purposely stayed away from social media -- but not because of the breakup. Instead, he wanted to focus on his highly-anticipated forthcoming album, ""Swimming,"" out Aug. 3. He said the timing of his not being on the internet as much and Grande's engagement have sparked worried comments.  ""I haven't been on the internet,"" he said. ""So, you know, people have assumed that I'm ... 'Are you OK? Is everything OK?'""  ""Because I was about to drop the album,"" he said. ""I don't know, it just all seemed kind of unimportant, the need to show people I was OK. Like, what is that? Where does that come from? Why? Why do we have this need to use social media and the internet?""",1

"Getty  Meghan has been looking a bit peaky at the last few events.  ‘She’s usually so full of energy and very lively – but she definitely seems tired and withdrawn at the moment,’ says a source. ‘Of course, all the baby whispers would explain why she’s not herself and seems so pale.’  The exciting development comes just weeks after Meghan described being married as ‘wonderful’, before adding Harry is ‘the best husband ever’.  The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‘It gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,’ reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen’s favourite and she’s taken a definite liking to Meghan – she sees a lot of herself in Meghan’s strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they’re to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‘We haven’t seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time – it was wonderful to see,’ the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‘Meghan’s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.’  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‘Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,’ revealed a source. ‘But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.’  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‘They’re desperate to have a family as soon as possible’.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn’t want to wait to start a family.  ‘They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,’ he said back in 2012.  ‘I’m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.’  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‘We will start a family in the near future,’ he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‘Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,’ she said.

"It has been 20 years since NSYNC formed in Orlando, Florida, bringing together Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and JC Chasez to form one of the biggest boy bands in the world. The group was launched first in Europe and essentially became an overnight success with their singles “I Want You Back” and “Tearin’ Up My Heart” before they were signed to RCA, transferring their success to North America. While their first album did well, their second album, No Strings Attached, did even better, becoming both the best-selling album of the decade and the top-selling album of 2000. It all came to a halt after a whirlwind of domination in the music industry when the group went on hiatus in 2002 and never re-formed. Everyone is well aware of the success and celebrity Justin Timberlake has enjoyed in his solo career, but in case you ever wondered how everyone in the group fared since their money-making heyday, check out NSYNC: How Much Are They Worth Now?  5. Chris Kirkpatrick  Estimated Net Worth: $13 Million. Chris Kirkpatrick may unfortunately be one of the most easily forgotten NSYNC members, but he is still doing well for himself with a net worth of $13 million. Following his days with the band, Kirkpatrick worked as a voice over actor, most notably on The Fairly OddParents. He then surprised fans when he appeared on the show Gone Country 2, and although he didn’t win, he impressed many with country song writing and singing skills. Since then he has kept a low profile and in 2015 appeared in the cult classic Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!  ADVERTISEMENT  2  4. Joey Fatone  Estimated Net Worth: $14 Million. Joey Fatone did not release any solo music after his career with NSYNC ended and instead turned to acting briefly, appearing in My Big Fat Greek Wedding and The Cooler, as well as other small roles. He enjoyed a resurgence in popularity after appearing on Season 4 of Dancing With the Stars where he ended up placing second. He has now turned to reality TV hosting, including Family Feud, The Singing Bee, and ReWrapped. He still manages to keep his bank account solid with an estimated net worth of $14 million.  3  3. JC Chasez  Estimated Net Worth: $16 Million. Along with Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez was recognized as a lead singer of NSYNC and following the group’s split he went on to pursue a solo career. While his albums didn’t generate too much buzz, he did have success writing and producing tracks for other artists. He also went on to be a judge on America’s Best Dance Crew which made him a respectable paycheque. He has also dabbled in acting, appearing in shows like the Ghost Whisperer and Las Vegas, and while he is by no means considered an A-lister anymore, he is still doing well with a net worth of $16 million.  4  2. Lance Bass  Estimated Net Worth: $22 Million. Lance Bass also turned away from a career in music after leaving NSYNC, and instead turned to acting where he has done voice acting and starred in his own film along with Joey Fatone, On the Line. He also done some work in dancing and writing, and has stayed in the public eye as an advocator for LGBT rights after coming out as gay in 2006.

"This article is about the American actor. For other people named Tom Cruise, see Tom Cruise (disambiguation)  Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. He started his career at age 19 in the film Endless Love (1981), before making his breakthrough in the comedy Risky Business (1983) and receiving widespread attention for starring in the action drama Top Gun (1986) as Lieutenant Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. After starring in The Color of Money (1986) and Cocktail (1988), Cruise starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning drama Rain Man. For his role as anti-war activist Ron Kovic in the drama Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Cruise received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.  In the 1990s, Cruise starred with Jack Nicholson in the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992) and starred in a number of box office hits including The Firm (1993) and Interview with the Vampire (1994), before starring as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in the action spy thriller Mission: Impossible (1996), the first of a commercially successful six-film series. In 1996, Cruise also starred as the title character in the romantic comedy-drama Jerry Maguire, earning him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second Academy Award nomination. In 1999, Cruise starred in the erotic thriller Eyes Wide Shut opposite his then wife Nicole Kidman and also appeared in the ensemble drama Magnolia, for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  After receiving a Saturn Award for Best Actor for his performance in the psychological thriller Vanilla Sky (2001), Cruise collaborated with director Steven Spielberg on the science fiction thrillers Minority Report (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005). In 2008, he gave a supporting performance in the action comedy Tropic Thunder and starred in the historical thriller Valkyrie as Claus von Stauffenberg. In 2012, Cruise played the eponymous role in the thriller Jack Reacher. Cruise's films have grossed more than $3.7 billion at U.S. and Canadian box offices and more than $9.0 billion worldwide,[1] making him the eighth highest-grossing actor in North America and one of the top-grossing actors worldwide.[2]  Cruise has been married three times, to actresses Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, Katie Holmes, and has three children, two of which were adopted during his marriage to Kidman and has one biological daughter with Holmes, whom he divorced from in 2012. Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, and credits it with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, his Church-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, particularly for 9/11 rescue workers, and his efforts to promote Scientology as a religion in Europe sparked controversies, as did a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.  Early life  Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III,[3] an electrical engineer, both originally from Louisville, Kentucky.[4][5] He has three sisters: Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. They are of English, German, and Irish ancestry.[6][7] One of Cruise's paternal great-great-great-grandfathers, Patrick Russell Cruise, was born in north County Dublin in 1799; he married Teresa Johnson in County Meath, in 1825. They left Ireland for the United States that same year and settled in New York.[6] They had a daughter, Mary Paulina Russell Cruise, whose son Thomas Cruise Mapother was Cruise's great-grandfather.[8][9][10][11] A cousin, William Mapother, is also an actor; he and Cruise have appeared in five films together.[12]  Cruise grew up in near poverty, and had a Catholic upbringing. The family was dominated by his abusive father, whom Cruise has described as ""a merchant of chaos.""[13] Cruise has said that he was beaten by his father, whom he has called a ""bully and coward."" He stated, ""He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'""[13]  Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. His family moved to Beacon Hill, Ottawa, in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces.[14] There, Cruise attended the newly opened Robert Hopkins Public School for much of grade four and grade five.[14][15] In grade four, Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.[14] Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, ""The movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece.""[14] Cruise also enjoyed sports at the school and played floor hockey, though he was known more for his aggression than his talent.[citation needed]  In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa, Canada. However, in the spring of that year, Cruise's mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.[14] His father died of cancer in 1984.[16] Cruise briefly attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest, before his interest in acting.[17]:24–26 In his senior year, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but he was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.[17]:47 In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years, including stints in at least two suburban New Jersey towns, including Glen Ridge.[18]  Career  Acting  Cruise first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as ""A Generation X classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise"",[19] and which, along with 1986's Top Gun, cemented his status as a superstar.[20] Cruise also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985.[21]  Cruise followed up Top Gun with The Color of Money, which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. 1988 saw him star in Cocktail, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989's Born on the Fourth of July, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.  Cruise's next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.[22]  In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.[23]  In 1996, he took on the title role in Jerry Maguire, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut, and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Magnolia, for which he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.  Cruise in March 2006  In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style, and continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures. Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for this film.  His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.[24][25] The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction thriller Minority Report which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.  In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick's historical drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star, and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.[24]  Edge of Tomorrow, May 2014. Cruise in Paris at the French premiere of, May 2014.  In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office.[26] In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as ""Les Grossman"" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.[27]  In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010.[28] On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011[29] to high critical acclaim[30] and box office success.[31] Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is Cruise's biggest commercial success to date.[32]  On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist.[33] In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages, in which he played the character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012.[34]  Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012.[35] It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $216,568,266 worldwide.[36][37] In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $285,600,588 worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko.[38][39]  As of mid-2015 Cruise's films have grossed about $8.2 billion worldwide.[40]  Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced.[41] Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director.  Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff's 1932 horror movie The Mummy.[42] The new film, also titled The Mummy, was produced by Alex Kurtzman, Chris Morgan, and Sean Daniel, written by Jon Spaihts and directed by Kurtzman. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout.  Producing  Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,[43] and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.  Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as ""one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood."" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.[44]  Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson's New York Times bestseller, The Devil in the White City about a real life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World's Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.[45]  Cruise has produced for multiple films in which he has been. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.[46]  Break with Paramount  On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount's parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.[47][48] Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.[49]  Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.[50][51]  Management of United Artists  In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.[43] Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive.  Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,[52] opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.  In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.[53]  Relationships  Cruise has been divorced three times and has three children (two adopted and one biological).  In the early to mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with older women, including Rebecca De Mornay,[54] three years his senior; Patti Scialfa,[55] nine years his senior; and Cher,[56] sixteen years his senior.[57]  Marriage to Mimi Rogers  Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987.[58] They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers introduced Cruise to the Church of Scientology.[59]  Marriage to Nicole Kidman  Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella and Connor Antony. In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, ""It was wrongly reported,"" and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.[60] Before Kidman's next marriage to Keith Urban, she spoke of how much she still loved Cruise, saying in 2006: ""He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him.""[61]  Dating Penelope Cruz and Nazanin Boniadi  Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). The relationship ended in 2004.[62] An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair states that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, the Church of Scientology launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of ""auditions"" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology.[63]  The Church of Scientology and Cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of ""shoddy journalism"" and ""religious bigotry.""[64] Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.[65][66]  Marriage to Katie Holmes  In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes – dubbed ""TomKat"" by the media – made their first public appearance together in Rome.[67] A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show, famously jumping up and down on Winfrey's couch during the show.[68] On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child.[69] In April 2006 their daughter Suri was born.  On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, in a Scientology ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars.[70][71] The actors' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[72] There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology.[73][74] David Miscavige, the head of the Church of Scientology, served as Cruise's best man.[75]  On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise after five and a half years of marriage.[76][77] On July 9, 2012, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers.[78] Because New York law requires that all divorce documents remain sealed, the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.[79]  Scientology  Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers at the 1989 Oscars  Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers.[80] Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age[81] and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.[82]  Cruise's advocacy of Scientology  In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin, described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.[83][84]  Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession[85] and from firefighters.[86]  For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.[87]  Criticism of psychiatry  In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement ""I think psychiatry should be outlawed.""[88] Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which Shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. Shields responded that Cruise ""should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.""[89] This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005.[90]  Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.[91][92] Shields herself called Cruise's comments ""a disservice to mothers everywhere.""[93] In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.[94]  Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.[87] It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.[95] Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.[96]  YouTube video removal  On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.[97][98] The Church of Scientology said the video had been ""pirated and edited"", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.[98][99] YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.[100]  After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of November 2017, the video has achieved over 12 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.[101]  Scientology's purported influence on Cruise's relationships  In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.[102]  In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.[103] DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.[104] Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.[105][106]  The 2015 documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor.[107] In the film, Cruise's former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion (which Cruise's lawyer denies).[108][109]  Legacy  Cruise and Katie Holmes interacting with fans in March 2006  In 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor,[110] as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor.[111] The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity.[112] The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the ""two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.""[113]  In August 2006, Paramount cited Cruise's ""recent conduct"" as the reason they did not renew their production contract with him.[114] In addition, Marketing Evaluations reported that Cruise's Q score (a measure of the popularity of celebrities), had fallen 40 percent.[115][116]  October 10, 2006, was declared ""Tom Cruise Day"" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because he has made more trips to Japan than any other Hollywood star.[117]  ""Tom Cruise Picture""  While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Some of Cruise's later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.  Widescreenings noted that for Tom Cruise's character Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men, ""[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do."" Sorkin and director Rob Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee's potential in the film.[118]  Litigation  During Cruise's marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.[119]  In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,[120] and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.[121]  Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis, who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.[122]  In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.[123]  In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dropped due to statute of limitations.[124][125]  In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style for defamation after the magazines claimed Cruise had ""abandoned"" his six-year-old daughter.[126] During deposition, Cruise acknowledged that 110 days had passed without him seeing her. The suit was ultimately dropped.[127]  Selected filmography  Awards and nominations  See also",0

"Movie  Report says that the 'How to Be a Latin Lover' actor is currently in talks to play the reality show star in a possible movie based on her new memoir 'The Secrets of My Life'.  Jun 8, 2017  AceShowbiz - Caitlyn Jenner new memoir ""The Secrets of My Life"" reportedly will be adapted into a movie, with ""How to Be a Latin Lover"" actor Rob Lowe reportedly in talks to play her. A source told OK! that the actor would be interested to portray the Olympian-turned-transgender reality show star.  ""Rob’s been hunting for an awards-caliber movie part. This would be a game-changer for him,"" a source told the magazine. The insider went on saying that Caitlyn had sent Rob a copy of her book and that ""they've met up a few times to discuss it."" The source added, ""She thinks he's got what it takes to play both her and her former self, Bruce, and now Rob's throwing his weight behind the project as well.""  However, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply ""not true."" A rep for Rob tells the site that ""he hasn't met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic."" Caitlyn simply said in an interview that Rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film, but the idea hasn't been brought into real life yet. As for the memoir itself, there hasn't been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie.  Caitlyn's 320-page memoir ""The Secret of My Life"" was published last April and chronicled her life as well as revealed some intriguing truths about her past. One of them was the claim that her ex-wife Kris Jenner actually knew about her gender issue during their then-marriage.  ""I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her,"" wrote Caitlyn. ""This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn...I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did, because I did it several times in front of her after we were married,"" she claimed.",0

The 2017-18 Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl Champions, and they've brought tremendous joy to hundreds of thousands throughout the City and region. They consistently wowed us with their dynamic play and relentless pursuit of victory. Their ""Next Man Up"" mentality when injuries arose was inspiring to anyone who has ever faced a setback, as was their willingness to embrace the role of underdogs. They looked another storied football franchise in the eyes, and never blinked. So to every member of the Eagles, from owners Jeff and Tina Lurie, and Christina Weiss Lurie, to Howie Roseman and the entire front office staff, to Doug Pederson and his coaches, and to the players who won our hearts with their resilient and exciting play: thank you. You are champions, and your accomplishments will forever be part of the rich history of Philadelphia sports. To the fans: I have long felt that our City's professional and collegiate sports teams bring Philadelphians together, regardless of race, income, neighborhood or gender, and that was never more true than during the Eagles' brilliant season. We know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your Birds as champs.

"Mindy Kaling nailed her commencement speech at Dartmouth College’s graduation ceremony in Hanover, New Hampshire, on Sunday, June 10. In her 17-minute address, the 38-year-old, who graduated from the Ivy League institution in 2001, shared practical advice — buy a toilet plunger before you need one — and opened up about life as a single mother.  The Mindy Project creator and star welcomed her daughter, Katherine Kaling, on December 15. She honored her late mom, Dr. Swati Roysircar, by choosing the middle name Swati for her first child. Kaling has not revealed the identity of the infant’s father.  “After my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, ‘Huh. According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me,’” Kaling told the crowd. “And I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, ‘Can I do this by myself?’”  The brief moment of panic quickly passed. “That feeling went away, because the reality is, I’m not doing it by myself,” Kaling shared. “I’m surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.”  The Oceans 8 actress urged graduates to not “be scared” if they “don’t do things in the right order” and to remember that life takes unexpected twists.  “I didn’t think I’d have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn’t change a thing,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d have dessert before breakfast today, but hey, it turned out that way and I I wouldn’t change a thing.”  Kaling, who starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time, also shared wisdom on self-confidence. “I was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do,” she revealed. “I was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I Just whispered, ‘Why not me?’ and I kept whispering it for 17 years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.”  She continued: “Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something, but especially not yourself. Go conquer the world. Just remember this: Why not you? You’ve made it this far.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1

"Springsteen redirects here. For other uses, see Springsteen (disambiguation)  Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter and musician, known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed ""The Boss"", he is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, his Jersey Shore roots, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and energetic stage performances.  Springsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984) find pleasures in the struggles of daily American life. He has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time.[1][2] He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, a Tony Award (for Springsteen on Broadway) as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999. In 2009, Springsteen was a Kennedy Center Honors recipient, in 2013 was named MusiCares person of the year, and in 2016 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[3]  Springsteen married Patti Scialfa in 1991. Their three children are Evan James Springsteen, Jessica Rae Springsteen, and Sam Ryan Springsteen.  Early life [ edit ]  Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey.[4] He was brought home from the hospital to Freehold Borough where he spent his childhood. He lived on South Street and attended Freehold Borough High School. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was of Dutch and Irish ancestry, and worked as a bus driver, among other vocations, but was unemployed most of the time. Springsteen said his mother, Adele Ann (née Zerilli), a legal secretary and of Italian ancestry, was the main breadwinner.[5][6] His maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense, a town near Naples.[7] He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. Pamela had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full-time; she took photos for his Human Touch, Lucky Town and The Ghost of Tom Joad albums.  Springsteen's last name is topographic and of Dutch origin, literally translating to ""jumping stone"" but more generally meaning a kind of stone used as a stepping stone in unpaved streets or between two houses.[8] The Springsteens are among the early Dutch families who settled in the colony of New Netherland in the 1600s.  Raised a Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with the nuns and rejected the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his later music reflects a Catholic ethos and includes a few rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns.[9] In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than political ideology that most influenced his music. He noted in the interview that his faith had given him a ""very active spiritual life"", although he joked that this ""made it very difficult sexually."" He added: ""Once a Catholic, always a Catholic.""[10]  In ninth grade, Springsteen began attending the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. Former teachers have said he was a ""loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar."" He graduated in 1967, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped the ceremony.[11] He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out.[9]  Career [ edit ]  1964–1972: Early years [ edit ]  This was different, shifted the lay of the land. Four guys, playing and singing, writing their own material ... Rock 'n' roll came to my house where there seemed to be no way out ... and opened up a whole world of possibilities. —Bruce Springsteen, on the impact of The Beatles[12]  Springsteen grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer Frank Sinatra on the radio. He became interested in being involved in music himself when, in 1956 and 1957, at the age of seven, he saw Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. Soon after this his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl's Music in Freehold for $6 a week but it failed to provide him with the 'instant gratification' he desired.[13] In 1964, Springsteen saw the three Beatles appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and, inspired, he bought his first guitar for $18.95 at the Western Auto Appliance Store.[14][12] Thereafter he started playing for audiences with a band called the Rogues at local venues such as the Elks Lodge in Freehold. In late 1964, Springsteen's mother took out a loan to buy her 16-year-old son a $60 Kent guitar, an act he subsequently memorialized in his song ""The Wish"". The following year, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles. His first gig with the Castiles was possibly at a trailer park on New Jersey Route 34. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big.[15][16]  Called for conscription in the United States Armed Forces when he was 18, Springsteen failed the physical examination and did not serve in the Vietnam War. He had suffered a concussion in a motorcycle accident when he was 17, and this together with his ""crazy"" behavior at induction gave him a classification of 4F, which made him unacceptable for service.[17]  In the late-1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a power trio known as Earth, playing in clubs in New Jersey, with one major show at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City. Earth consisted of John Graham on bass, and Mike Burke on drums. Bob Alfano was later added on organ, but was replaced for two gigs by Frank 'Flash' Craig.[15]  Ordinary life in New Jersey beach towns such as Asbury Park are the background to Springsteen's early lyrics  From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with Steel Mill (originally called Child), which included Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, Vinnie Roslin and later Steve Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. During this time he performed regularly at venues on the Jersey Shore, in Richmond, Virginia,[18] Nashville, Tennessee, and a set of gigs in California,[15] quickly gathering a cult following. San Francisco Examiner music critic Philip Elwood gave Springsteen credibility in his glowing assessment of Steel Mill: ""I have never been so overwhelmed by totally unknown talent."" Elwood went on to praise their ""cohesive musicality"" and, in particular, singled out Springsteen as ""a most impressive composer"".  Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style: Dr. Zoom & the Sonic Boom (early- to mid-1971), the Sundance Blues Band (mid-1971), and the Bruce Springsteen Band (mid-1971 to mid-1972). With the addition of pianist David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horn sections, the Zoomettes (a group of female backing vocalists for Dr. Zoom) and Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&B, jazz, church music, early rock 'n' roll, and soul, with major influences being Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Leon Russell and Van Morrison.[15]  Springsteen acquired the nickname ""The Boss"" during this period; when he played club gigs with a band he took on the task of collecting the band's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.[19] The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of Monopoly that Springsteen would play with other Jersey Shore musicians.[20] Springsteen is not fond of this nickname, due to his dislike of bosses,[19] but seems to have since tacitly accepted it. Previously he had the nickname ""Doctor"".[21][22]  His prolific songwriting ability (with ""more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums"", as his future record label would describe it in early publicity campaigns) brought his skills to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: New managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, who in turn brought him to the attention of Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond. Hammond auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.  Even after Springsteen gained international acclaim, his New Jersey roots showed through in his music, and he often praised ""the great state of New Jersey"" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he has routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York venues. He has also made many surprise appearances at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years.  1972–1974: Initial struggle for success [ edit ]  Springsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by Clive Davis, after having initially piqued the interest of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label a decade earlier. Despite the expectations of Columbia Records' executives that Springsteen would record an acoustic album, he brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named for several months). His debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite[23] though sales were slow.  Because of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like ""Blinded by the Light""[note 1] and ""For You"", as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. ""He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone'"" wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen's first interview/profile in March 1973. Photographs for that original profile were taken by Ed Gallucci.[24][25] Crawdaddy discovered Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Knobler profiled him in Crawdaddy three times, in 1973, 1975 and 1978.[26] (Springsteen and the E Street Band acknowledged the magazine's support by giving a private performance at the Crawdaddy 10th Anniversary Party in New York City in June 1976.)[27] Music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem in 1975 that when Springsteen's first album was released ""... many of us dismissed it: he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison's"".[28] The track ""Spirit in the Night"" especially showed Morrison's influence, while ""Lost in the Flood"" was the first of many portraits of Vietnam veterans, and ""Growin' Up"", his first take on the recurring theme of adolescence.  In September 1973, Springsteen's second album The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more R&B vibe, and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"" and ""Incident on 57th Street"" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing ""Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"" continues to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.  In the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston's The Real Paper music critic Jon Landau wrote, after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, ""I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time.""[29] Landau helped to finish the epic new album Born to Run and subsequently became Springsteen's manager and producer. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a ""Wall of Sound"" production. But fed by the release of an early mix of ""Born to Run"" to nearly a dozen radio stations, anticipation built toward the album's release.[30]  The album took more than 14 months to record, with six months spent on the song ""Born to Run"". During this time, Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard ""sounds in [his] head"" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during these recording sessions that ""Miami"" Steve Van Zandt would stumble into the studio just in time to help Springsteen organize the horn section on ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"". Van Zandt, who would eventually join the E Street Band, had been a longtime friend of Springsteen, as well as a collaborator on earlier musical projects, and understood where he was coming from, which helped him to translate some of the sounds Springsteen was hearing. Still, by the end of the grueling recording sessions Springsteen was not satisfied, and upon first hearing the finished album, threw it into the alley and told Jon Landau he would rather just cut it live at The Bottom Line (a place he often played).[31]  1975–1983: Breakthrough [ edit ]  On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York's The Bottom Line club. This attracted major media attention and was broadcast live on WNEW-FM. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.)[32] Oklahoma City rock radio station WKY, in association with Carson Attractions, staged an experimental promotional event that resulted in a sold out house at the (6,000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall. With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and while reception at US top 40 radio outlets for the album's two singles was not overwhelming (""Born to Run"" reached a modest No. 23 on the Billboard charts, and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" peaked at No. 83), almost every track on the album received album-oriented rock airplay, especially ""Born to Run"", ""Thunder Road"", ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" and ""Jungleland"", all of which remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations.  Springsteen appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that he eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a concert appearance in London.  Springsteen and the E Street Band, 1977  A legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, Springsteen's new songs sounded more somber than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen's career. Gone were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters, and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and length of its shows.[33]  By the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a US No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of Greetings' ""Blinded by the Light"" in early 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her take on Springsteen's unreleased ""Because the Night"" (with revised lyrics by Smith) in 1978, while The Pointer Sisters hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's also unreleased ""Fire"". Although not a critical success, long time friend Southside Johnny recorded Springsteen's ""The Fever"" in early 1976 and ""Talk to Me"" in 1978. The two of them along with Steve Van Zandt collaborated to produce ""Trapped Again"" in 1978.  In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album, as well as the following summer's No Nukes documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.  Springsteen continued to focus on working-class life with the 20-song double album The River in 1980, which included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads, and finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, ""Hungry Heart"". Like the previous two albums, musical styles on The River were derived largely from rock 'n' roll music of the 50s and 60s, but with a more explicit pop-rock sound than earlier albums. This is apparent in the adoption of Eighties pop-rock hallmarks like the reverberating-tenor drums, very basic percussion/guitar and repetitive lyrics apparent in many of the tracks. The title song pointed to Springsteen's intellectual direction, while a couple of the lesser-known tracks presaged his musical direction. The album sold well, becoming his first No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and a long tour in 1980 and 1981 followed, which included Springsteen's first extended tour of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U.S.  The River was followed in 1982 by the stark solo acoustic Nebraska. Recording sessions had been held to expand on a demo tape Springsteen had made at his home on a simple, low-tech four-track tape deck. However, during the recording process Springsteen and producer Jon Landau realized the songs worked better as solo acoustic numbers than full band renditions and the original demo tape was released as the album. Although the recordings of the E Street Band were shelved, other songs from these sessions would later be released, including ""Born in the U.S.A"" and ""Glory Days"". According to the Marsh biographies, Springsteen was depressed when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. While Nebraska did not sell as well as Springsteen's three previous albums, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named ""Album of the Year"" by Rolling Stone magazine's critics) and influenced later works by other major artists, including U2's album The Joshua Tree. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with Nebraska's release.  1984–1991: Commercial and popular phenomenon [ edit ]  Springsteen is probably best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S., 30 million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the Top 10. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics—except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways.[34] The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.[35]  The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. In 1984, conservative columnist George Will attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen's work ethic. Six days after the column was printed, in a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey, Reagan said, ""America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen."" Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, ""Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one."" He then began playing ""Johnny 99"", with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.[36]  Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by the Chrysler Corporation to use ""Born in the U.S.A."" in a car commercial. In later years, to eliminate the bombast and make the song's original meaning more explicitly clear, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only by acoustic guitar, thus returning to how the song was originally conceived. The original acoustic version of the song, recorded in 1982 during the Nebraska sessions, appeared on the 1998 archival release Tracks.  ""Dancing in the Dark"" was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U.S.A., peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The video for the song showed a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress's career. The song ""Cover Me"" was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer, but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, ""Protection"". Videos for the album were directed by Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen played on the ""We Are the World"" song and album in 1985. His live single ""Trapped"" from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.[37]  During the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen met actress Julianne Phillips, whom he would marry in 1985. He also that year took part in the recording of the USA For Africa charity song ""We Are The World""; however he declined to play at Live Aid. He later stated that he ""simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be"". He has since expressed regret at turning down Bob Geldof's invitation, stating that he could have played a couple of acoustic songs had there been no slot available for a full band performance.  The Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of Arthur Baker's dance mixes of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the UK Albums Chart: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.[38]  Live/1975–85, a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. Live/1975–85 summed up Springsteen's career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen's difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long coda to ""Racing in the Street"". Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album's song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and trading among fans.  During the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including Backstreets magazine, which started in Seattle and continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website.  After this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love album (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his marriage to Julianne Phillips and described some of his unhappiness in the relationship. Reflecting the challenges of love in ""Brilliant Disguise"", Springsteen sang:  So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes/Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?  The subsequent Tunnel of Love Express Tour shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements. During the European leg in 1988, Springsteen's relationship with backup singer Patti Scialfa became public. Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988.[39]  Springsteen performing on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour at the Radrennbahn Weißensee in East Berlin on July 19, 1988  On July 19, 1988, Springsteen held a concert in East Germany that attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum has called the concert ""the most important rock concert ever, anywhere"", in his 2013 book Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. It had been conceived by the Socialist Unity Party's youth wing in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in the DDR, and helped contribute to the fall of the Berlin Wall the following year.[40]  Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In late 1989 he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California, marrying in 1991.  1992–1998: Artistic and commercial ups and downs and soundtrack work [ edit ]  In 1992, after risking fan accusations of ""going Hollywood"" by moving to Los Angeles and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were even more introspective than any of his previous work and displayed a newly revealed confidence. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself.  An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program (later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:  I've gotta thank him because—what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs—and I tried it in the early '90s and it didn't work; the public didn't like it.[41]  A multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song ""Streets of Philadelphia"", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the ""Brilliant Disguise"" video.  In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), and also one show at Tramps in New York City,[42] he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad, inspired by John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and by Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass, a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. This was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet and not to clap during the performances.  In April 1996, Springsteen gave an interview to LGBT magazine The Advocate writer Judy Wieder, in which he spoke of the importance of fighting for gay marriage. ""You get your license, you do all the social rituals. It's part of your place in society, and in some way part of society's acceptance of you.""[43]  Following the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family.[44] In 1998, he released the sprawling, four-disc box set of outtakes, Tracks. Later, he would acknowledge that the 1990s were a ""lost period"" for him: ""I didn't do a lot of work. Some people would say I didn't do my best work.""[45]  1999–2007: Return to success [ edit ]  Springsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by Bono (the lead singer of U2), a favor he returned in 2005.[46]  In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden, which ended the tour. The final two shows were recorded for HBO, with corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City. A new song, ""American Skin (41 Shots)"", about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, which was played at these shows proved controversial.  In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. (Many of the songs were influenced by phone conversations Springsteen had with family members of victims of the attacks who in their obituaries had mentioned how his music touched their lives.) The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show, The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S. because of his vocal endorsement of leftist, liberal politics. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close.[47] During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Springsteen-oriented online communities had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour concluded with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy over ""American Skin"" and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan.  During the early 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations, and causes. These shows were explicitly intended for the devoted fans, including numbers such as the E Street Shuffle outtake ""Thundercrack"", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song ""My City of Ruins"" was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon broadcast, he selected ""My City of Ruins"", which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the broadcast, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to ""Rise up!"" The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close The Rising album and as an encore on the subsequent tour.  At the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash's ""London Calling"" along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt and No Doubt's bassist, Tony Kanal, in tribute to Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and the triple Sandinista!.  In 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band participated in the Vote for Change tour, along with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, the Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in swing states, to benefit the progressive political organization group America Coming Together and to encourage people to register and vote. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed —against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, Amnesty International, and the Christic Institute—he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan ""Born in the U.S.A."" flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen's ""No Surrender"" became the main campaign theme song for John Kerry's unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies.  Devils & Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, with a few having been performed then but not released.[48] The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen's anti-corporate politics. The album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo Devils & Dust Tour at the same time as the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, ukulele, banjo, electric guitar, and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar, and percussion were also used for some songs.)  In November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station called E Street Radio. This channel played commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews, and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.  In April 2006, Springsteen released We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. A tour began the same month, with the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed The Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to The Sessions Band). Seeger Sessions material was emphasized, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews,[49] but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.[50][51][52] By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.  Springsteen's next album, titled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it had 10 new Springsteen songs plus ""Long Walk Home"", performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), ""Terry's Song"", a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died on July 30, 2007.[53] Magic debuted at No. 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the Irish charts at No. 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in Norway again. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted E Street Radio on September 27, 2007, in anticipation of Magic.[54] Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications was alleged to have sent an edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material. However, Clear Channel Adult Alternative (or ""AAA"") station KBCO did play tracks from the album, undermining the allegations of a corporate blackout.[55]  The Springsteen and E Street Band Magic Tour began at the Hartford Civic Center with the album's release and continued through North America and Europe.  It was announced on November 21, 2007, that Springsteen's longtime friend and founding E Street Band member, Danny Federici, would be taking a leave of absence from the Magic Tour to pursue treatment for melanoma. Charles Giordano filled in as Federici's replacement.  2008–2011: Deaths of Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons [ edit ]  Federici returned to the stage on March 20, 2008, when he appeared for portions of a Springsteen and E Street Band performance at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Less than one month later, on April 17, 2008, Federici died at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, having suffered for three years from melanoma.[56][57]  On January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for ""The Wrestler"", from the Darren Aronofsky film by the same name.[58] After receiving a heartfelt letter from lead actor Mickey Rourke, Springsteen supplied the song for the film for free.[59]  Springsteen performed at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009,[60] agreeing to do it after many previous offers.[61] A few days before the game, Springsteen gave a rare press conference at which he promised a ""twelve-minute party.""[62][63] His 12-minute 45-second set, with the E Street Band and the Miami Horns, included abbreviated renditions of ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"""", ""Born to Run"", ""Working on a Dream"", and ""Glory Days"", the latter complete with football references in place of the original baseball-themed lyrics. The set of appearances and promotional activities led Springsteen to say, ""This has probably been the busiest month of my life.""[64]  Springsteen supported Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, announcing his endorsement in April 2008[65] and going on to appear at several Obama rallies as well as performing several solo acoustic performances in support of Obama's campaign throughout 2008,[66] culminating with a November 2 rally at which he debuted the song ""Working on a Dream"" in a duet with Scialfa.[67] At an Ohio rally, Springsteen discussed the importance of ""truth, transparency and integrity in government, the right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise and the sanctity of home...""[68]  Following Obama's electoral victory on November 4, Springsteen's song ""The Rising"" was the first song played over the loudspeakers after Obama's victory speech in Chicago's Grant Park. Springsteen was the musical opener for the Obama Inaugural Celebration on January 18, 2009, which was attended by over 400,000 people.[69] He performed ""The Rising"" with an all-female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie's ""This Land Is Your Land"" with Pete Seeger.  Springsteen's Working on a Dream album, dedicated to the memory of Danny Federici, was released in late January 2009[62] and the supporting Working on a Dream Tour ran from April 2009 until November 2009. The tour presented few songs from the new album, with set lists dominated instead by classics and selections reflecting the ongoing late-2000s recession.[70] Springsteen also played songs requested by audience members holding up signs, a practice begun during the final stages of the Magic Tour.[70] Drummer Max Weinberg was replaced for some shows by his 18-year-old son Jay Weinberg, so that the former could serve his role as bandleader on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.[70] During this tour, Springsteen and the band made their first real foray in the world of music festivals, headlining nights at the Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands, Festival des Vieilles Charrues in France, the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the United States and the Glastonbury Festival[71] and Hard Rock Calling in the UK.[72] Several shows on the tour presented Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, or Born in the U.S.A. in its entirety.[73] The band performed five final shows at Giants Stadium, opening with a new song highlighting the historic stadium, and Springsteen's Jersey roots, named ""Wrecking Ball"".[74] A DVD from the Working on a Dream Tour entitled London Calling: Live in Hyde Park was released in 2010.  Fireworks go off at the conclusion of the ""E! Street! Band!"" exhortation during the final shows at Giants Stadium  Springsteen was among the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual award to figures from the world of arts for their contribution to American culture, on December 6, 2009.[75] President Obama gave a speech in which he talked about how Springsteen had incorporated the life of regular Americans in his expansive palette of songs and how his concerts were beyond typical rock-and-roll concerts, how, apart from being high-energy concerts, they were ""communions"". He ended the remark ""while I am the president, he is the Boss"". Tributes were paid by several well-known celebrities including Jon Stewart (who described Springsteen's ""unprecedented combination of lyrical eloquence, musical mastery and sheer unbridled, unadulterated joy""). A musical tribute included John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Jennifer Nettles, Melissa Etheridge, Eddie Vedder, and Sting.  Springsteen was among a host of musicians who voiced extensive criticism regarding the merging of Ticketmaster with Live Nation, saying ""the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing.""[76]  The 2000s ended with Springsteen named one of eight Artists of the Decade by Rolling Stone magazine[77] and with Springsteen's tours ranking him fourth among artists in total concert grosses for the decade.[78] His 2010 tour included venues in the UK and Ireland.  In September 2010, a documentary about the making of Springsteen's 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film, The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, was included in a box set reissue of the album, entitled The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story, released in November 2010. Also airing on HBO, the documentary explored Springsteen's making of the album and his role in the production and development of the tracks.  Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band's saxophonist and founding member, died on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke. ""Clarence lived a wonderful life"", Springsteen said. ""He carried within him a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage.""[79]  2012–2015: Wrecking Ball, High Hopes, American Beauty and The Ties That Bind box set [ edit ]  Springsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. The album consists of eleven tracks plus two bonus tracks. Three songs previously only available as live versions—""Wrecking Ball"", ""Land of Hope and Dreams"", and ""American Land""—appear on the album.[80] Wrecking Ball became Springsteen's tenth No. 1 album in the United States, tying him with Elvis Presley for third most No. 1 albums of all-time. Only The Beatles (19) and Jay Z (12) have more No. 1 albums.[81]  Following the release of the album, Springsteen and the E Street Band announced plans for the Wrecking Ball Tour, which began on March 18, 2012. As tickets for the first U.S. dates went on sale, many fans were unable to obtain tickets, much like for the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour, allegedly due to ticket scalpers. Shows sold out within minutes and many tickets appeared, at much higher prices, on resale websites such as StubHub less than an hour after the onsale time. Ticketmaster said web traffic was 2.5 times the highest level of the past year during the online sales and suggested that scalpers played a big role. On July 31, 2012, in Helsinki, Finland, Springsteen performed his longest concert ever at 4 hours and 6 minutes and 33 songs. Not included in this total time is a thirty-minute, five-song, solo acoustical set he did about two hours before the show.[82]  Springsteen was honored with the 2013 MusiCares Person of the Year award in recognition of his creative accomplishments as well as his charitable work and philanthropic activities. A ceremony was held on February 8, 2013, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, two days before the Grammy Awards.[83]  Despite saying he would sit out the 2012 presidential election, Springsteen campaigned for President Barack Obama's re-election in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Wisconsin. At the rallies, he briefly spoke to the audience and performed a short acoustic set that included a newly written song titled ""Forward"".[84][85][86] Obama also used ""We Take Care of Our Own"" as one of his top campaign songs. Use of the song helped boost sales of the song by 409%.[87]  On October 29, 2012, the New Jersey area was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Two days later, Springsteen dedicated his performance at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, New York, to those affected by the storm and those helping to recover. Springsteen and the E Street Band performed ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" at a one-hour televised telethon called Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together on November 2, 2012, which aired on NBC and at the same time many other channels. Springsteen also joined Billy Joel, Steven Tyler and Jimmy Fallon for a performance of ""Under the Boardwalk"". All money was donated to the American Red Cross.[88] Springsteen and the E Street Band, along with many top names in the music industry, performed at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 2012, for 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief.  At year's end, the Wrecking Ball Tour was named Top Draw for having the top attendance out of any tour by the Billboard Touring Awards. The tour finished second to Roger Waters, who had the top grossing tour of 2012.[89] Springsteen finished second only to Madonna as the top money maker of 2012 with $33.44 million.[90] The Wrecking Ball album, along with the single ""We Take Care of Our Own"", was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song for ""We Take Care of Our Own"" and Best Rock Album.[91][92] Rolling Stone named Wrecking Ball the number one album of 2012 on their Top 50 albums of 2012 list.[93]  In March 2013, and for the first time since re-uniting with Springsteen in 1999, Steven Van Zandt was forced to miss the Australian leg of the band's tour due to acting commitments on his television show Lilyhammer. He was replaced by guitarist Tom Morello for the leg.[94]  In late July 2013, the documentary Springsteen & I, directed by Baillie Walsh and produced by Ridley Scott, was released simultaneously via a worldwide cinema broadcast in over 50 countries and in over 2000 movie theaters.[95]  The Wrecking Ball Tour, which came to an end in September 2013, was one of Springsteen's most successful. A week after it ended, Springsteen announced a 2014 tour that would include dates in Australia and New Zealand.[96]  Springsteen, along with friend and mentor Pete Seeger, as well as Herbie Hancock, Sally Field and Robert De Niro, was among a total of 198 class of 2013 inductees into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The induction ceremony was held at the Academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts in October 2013.  In October 2013, Springsteen posted a letter on his website thanking fans of all ages for their support throughout the Wrecking Ball World Tour. A highlight video of the tour was also released showing a new studio recording of the Suicide song, ""Dream Baby Dream"".[97]  Springsteen released his eighteenth studio album, High Hopes, on January 14, 2014. The first single and video were of a newly recorded version of the song ""High Hopes"", which Springsteen had previously recorded in 1995. The album was the first by Springsteen in which all songs are either cover songs, newly recorded outtakes from previous records, or newly recorded versions of songs previously released. The 2014 E Street Band touring lineup, along with deceased E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, appears on the album along with guitarist Tom Morello.[98]  It was announced on January 15, 2014 that Springsteen would start making professional recordings of all of his live shows available following each performance on his upcoming tour via download to a special USB wristband.[99] In addition to the wristbands, shows will also be offered through Springsteen's website until June 30, 2014.[100] Springsteen along with the E Street Band and guitarist Tom Morello, kicked off the High Hopes Tour on January 26, 2014. The tour was considered to be a continuation of the Wrecking Ball Tour.  High Hopes became Springsteen's eleventh No. 1 album in the US.[101] It was his tenth No. 1 in the UK, tying him for fifth all-time The Rolling Stones and U2.[102] On April 4, 2014, HBO aired Bruce Springsteen's High Hopes a 30-minute documentary on the recording of High Hopes.[103] Rolling Stone named High Hopes the second best album of the year (behind only U2's Songs of Innocence) on their Top 50 Albums of 2014 list.[104]  Announced as inductees in December 2013, Springsteen inducted past and present members of the E Street Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, with each member giving a speech and Springsteen and the band performing a three-song set of ""The E Street Shuffle"", ""The River"" and ""Kitty's Back"".[105]  American Beauty, a limited edition four-song EP on 12-inch vinyl released exclusively for Record Store Day on April 18, 2014 contains four unreleased songs from the High Hopes sessions.[106] A music video for the title track was also released. After 34 shows and 182 songs performed, the High Hopes Tour came to an end on May 18, 2014. Springsteen released a short film for the song ""Hunter of Invisible Game"" on July 9, 2014 through his website. It marked Springsteen's directorial debut.[107]  On November 17, 2014, Springsteen released The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-1984, an 8-disc remastered version of his first seven studio albums, some of which had been remastered for the first time.[108]  Springsteen made his acting debut in the final episode of Season 3 of Van Zandt's show Lilyhammer, which was named ""Loose Ends"", after a Springsteen song on his album Tracks. He played Giuseppe Tagliano, the brother of Van Zandt's character, Frank Tagliano aka ""Giovanni ""Johnny"" Henrikssen"". Giuseppe is an undertaker and owner of a funeral parlor who occasionally works as a hitman for a mafia family which Frank is associated.  In November 2014, Springsteen announced that he would be opening the Bruce Springsteen Archives and will release live concerts from throughout his career including many shows which fans consider to be among his most essential performances and that were only previously available through bootlegs. Each show has been completely restored, remixed and remastered for the highest possible sound quality and are available for purchase through digital download or CD at live.brucespringsteen.net, where fans can also buy all of Springsteen's live recordings from the High Hopes Tour.[109]  On August 6, 2015, Springsteen performed ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" and ""Born to Run"" on the final episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, as Stewart's final 'Moment of Zen'. On October 16, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of The River, Springsteen announced The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. Released on December 4, it contains four CDs (including many previously unreleased songs) and three DVDs (or Blu-ray) along with a 148-page coffee table book. In November 2015, ""American Skin (41 Shots)"" was performed with John Legend at Shining a Light: A Concert for Progress on Race in America.  Springsteen made his first appearance on Saturday Night Live since 2002 on December 19, 2015, performing ""Meet Me in the City"", ""The Ties That Bind"", and ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"".[110] On December 4, 2015, he announced details for the upcoming The River Tour 2016 which would begin the following year. Springsteen also discussed plans for a new solo album however plans were put on hold to tour with the E Street Band in support of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection. Springsteen said ""the project I've been working on is more of a solo project. It wasn't a project I was going to probably take the band out on. So I said, 'Gee, that's going to push the band playing again until a ways in the future. It'll be nice to get some playing in so you don't wind up being two or three years between E Street tours.""[111]  2016–present: The River Tour 2016/Summer '17, Chapter and Verse, autobiography and Broadway performances [ edit ]  The River Tour 2016 began in January 2016 in support of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. All first-leg shows in North America included an in-sequence performance of the entire The River album along with other songs from Springsteen's catalog, and all dates were recorded and made available for purchase.[112] More dates were eventually announced expanding the original three-month tour into a seven-month tour with shows in Europe in May 2016 and another North American leg starting in August 2016 and ending the following month. As of July 2016, The River 2016 Tour has been the highest grossing worldwide tour with 1.1 million tickets sold and over $135 million in box office revenue, according to Billboard Boxscore's mid-year report.  In July 2016, Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, discussed Springsteen's upcoming solo album, which is expected for release in 2017, saying ""All I can say is that there is a solo record – and when I say solo record, I'm not talking about an acoustic record. It is, in fact, a very expansive record, a very rich record. It's one of Bruce's very creative efforts. Stay tuned, and we'll see exactly how that shapes up next year."" Landau also said it was too early to know a release day or plans for a supporting tour.[113]  On September 23, 2016, Chapter and Verse, a compilation from throughout Springsteen's career dating back to 1966, was released. Five of the album's eighteen tracks had not been previously released; they include Springsteen's earliest recording from 1966, songs from his tenure in early 1970s bands such as the Castiles, Steel Mill and The Bruce Springsteen Band, along with a track from each studio album of his career.[114] On September 27, 2016, Simon & Schuster published his 500-page autobiography, Born to Run. The book rose quickly to the top of the NY Times Best Sellers List.[115] Springsteen announced he would promote his autobiography with a seventeen date book tour from September to December 2016.[116]  Springsteen receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House from President Barack Obama  Springsteen began the final leg of The River 2016 Tour on August 23, 2016, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey where he performed for 3 hours and 52 minutes making it at the time the longest show he had ever performed in the United States.[117] The record was broken two nights later at MetLife Stadium when Springsteen performed a 3-hour 59-minute show, later topped by his performance of August 30, 2016, at 4 hours and 1 minute which then stood as his longest show in the United States. That record again was topped on September 7, 2016, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Springsteen performed for 4 hours and 4 minutes, which now stands as his longest show in the United States and second-longest ever next to a 2012 show in Helsinki which lasted two minutes longer.[118][119] The tour ended in September 2016; however, dates from January 22, 2017 to February 25, 2017 were added using the same promotional image from The River Tour 2016 although the tour was now renamed the Summer '17 tour.[120] The River 2016 Tour was the top-grossing worldwide tour of 2016; it pulled in $268.3 million globally and was the highest grossing tour since 2014 for any artist topping Taylor Swift's 2015 tour which grossed $250.1 million.[121]  Springsteen supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign by performing an acoustic set of ""Thunder Road"", ""Long Walk Home"" and ""Dancing in the Dark"" at a rally in Philadelphia on November 7, 2016. On November 22, 2016, Springsteen was presented—along with twenty other recipients—the Presidential Medal of Freedom award by Barack Obama.[122] The award is the highest honor for a civilian to receive and is ""presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.""[123] On January 12, 2017, Springsteen along with Patti Scialfa performed a special 15-song acoustic set for President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at the White House's East Room two days before the president gave his farewell address to the nation.[124][125]  Springsteen on Broadway, an eight-week run at the Walter Kerr Theatre on Broadway in New York City in fall 2017, was announced in June 2017[126] and in addition to his music, includes Springsteen reading excerpts from his 2016 autobiography Born to Run and performing other spoken reminiscences written for the show.[127] Originally scheduled to run from October 12 through November 26, the show was extended three times, the last performance now scheduled for December 15, 2018.[128][129][130]  With rumors swirling that Springsteen's solo shows on Broadway could continue well past their current June 2018 end date, on January 18, 2018, Nils Lofgren was asked on Twitter if the E Street Band will ever tour with Bruce again. Lofgren responded saying ""I sure hope so"" however Gary Tallent responded saying that it was ""looking unlikely though"" fueling rumors of the end of the E Street Band.[131][132] The following day, Tallent responded to his original comment saying ""just to be clear, I know as much as you. I like Nils' answer better"".[133] On February 2, 2018, Max Weinberg commented on the future of the E Street Band performing with Springsteen saying ""Don’t worry, we ain’t done yet. The E Street Band will be back out on the road."" [134]  For Springsteen’s production of Springsteen on Broadway, he will be honored with a special award at the upcoming Tony Awards as announced on May 1, 2018.[135]  Musical style [ edit ]  Springsteen (second from right) was among the five recipients of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors  Springsteen draws on many musical influences from the reservoir of traditional American popular music, folk, blues and country. From the beginning, rock and roll has been a dominant influence and Springsteen's musical and lyrical evocations, as well as public tributes, of artists such as Dylan, Presley, The Animals, Roy Orbison, Gary ""U.S."" Bonds, and many others helped to rekindle interest in their music. Springsteen's other preferred musical style is American folk, evident on his debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey, and more strongly on Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad. Springsteen songs such as ""This Hard Land"" demonstrate the lyrical and musical influence of Woody Guthrie.  Elements of Latin American music, jazz, soul, and funk influences can be heard on Springsteen's second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle; the song ""New York City Serenade"" is even reminiscent of the music of George Gershwin. Prominent in these two records is the pianist David Sancious, who left the band shortly into the recording of Springsteen's third album, Born To Run (which also emphasized the piano, played by Roy Bittan).  Subsequently, Springsteen focused more on the rock elements of his music. He initially compressed the sound and developed Darkness on the Edge of Town just as straightforward as concise musical idiom, for the simple riffs, rock guitar solos and clearly recognizable song structures are dominant. His music has been categorized as heartland rock, a style typified by Springsteen, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp. This music has a lyrical reference to the U.S. everyday and the music is kept rather simple and straightforward. This development culminated with Springsteen's hit album Born in the U.S.A., the title song of which has a constantly repeating, fanfare-like keyboard riff and a pounding drum beat. These sounds fit with Springsteen's voice: it cries to the listener the unsentimental story of a disenchanted angry figure. Even songs that can be argued to be album tracks proved to be singles that enjoyed some chart success, such as ""My Hometown"" and ""I'm on Fire"", in which the drum line is formed from subtle hi-hat and rim-clicks-shock (shock at the edge of the snare drum) accompanied by synthesizer and Springsteen's soft guitar line. The album, along with some previous records such as ""Cadillac Ranch"" showed clear rockabilly influences as is evident from his guitar solos, in-fills and vocal styles on these. Another clear influence of early rock n roll on Springsteen's music is evident on the song ""Light of Day"".[citation needed]  In recent years, Springsteen has changed his music further. There are more folk elements up to the gospel to be heard. His last solo album, Devils and Dust, drew rave reviews not only for Springsteen's complex songwriting, but also for his expressive and sensitive singing.  On the album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions Springsteen performed folk classics with a folk band, rather than his usual E Street Band. On his ensuing tour he also interpreted some of his own rock songs in a folk style.  On his 2012 album, Wrecking Ball, Springsteen incorporated a variety of styles, including folk, gospel, and even hip-hop, with a rap in the song ""Rocky Ground"". His studio work with producer Ron Aniello, Wrecking Ball and High Hopes, has also become more experimental, featuring loops and computerized sounds.  Lyrical themes [ edit ]  ""I spent most of my life as a musician measuring the distance between the American Dream and American reality."" —Bruce Springsteen[136][note 2]  Often described as cinematic in their scope, Springsteen's lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment, dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of everyday situations.[137]  It has been recognized that there was a shift in his lyrical approach starting with the album Darkness on the Edge of Town, in which he focused on the emotional struggles of working class life.[138][139]  Personal life [ edit ]  The Springsteen family greets the Obama family on-stage at a rally in Cleveland , Ohio on November 2, 2008.  In the early 1980s, Springsteen met Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony, a bar in New Jersey where local musicians regularly perform. On that particular evening she was performing alongside one of Springsteen's pals, Bobby Bandiera, with whom she had written ""At Least We Got Shoes"" for Southside Johnny. Springsteen liked her voice and after the performance, introduced himself to her. Soon after that, they started spending time together and became friends.[140]  Early in 1984, Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the upcoming Born in the U.S.A. Tour. According to the book Bruce Springsteen on Tour 1969–2005 by Dave Marsh, it looked like Springsteen and Scialfa were on the brink of becoming a couple through the first leg of the tour. But before that could happen, Barry Bell introduced actress/model Julianne Phillips (b.1960) to Springsteen; they were married on May 13, 1985, held shortly after midnight at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church in Lake Oswego, a suburb south of Portland, Oregon.[141][142][143] Opposites in background, the two had an 11-year age difference, and his traveling took its toll on their relationship. His next album, Tunnel of Love, was released in the autumn of 1987 and many of its songs described his unhappiness in the relationship with Phillips.  The Tunnel of Love Express Tour began in late February 1988, and Springsteen convinced Scialfa to join the tour again. She expressed reluctance at first, since she wanted to start recording her first solo album, but after Springsteen told her that the tour would be short, she agreed to postpone her own solo record.[144] Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988, but it wasn't made known to the press. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in love with each other during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started living together soon after his separation from Phillips. Citing irreconcilable differences, Julianne filed for divorce in Los Angeles on August 30, 1988;[145] a settlement was reached in December and it was finalized on March 1, 1989.[146][147]  Springsteen received press criticism for the hastiness in which he and Scialfa took up their relationship. In a 1995 interview with The Advocate, Springsteen told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received. ""It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'"" He also told Wieder that, ""I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, 'Hey, what does it matter?' But it does matter. It's very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly—which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals—is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society's acceptance of you ... Patti and I both found that it did mean something.""[43]  Springsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey, before moving to Los Angeles, where they decided to start a family.[148] On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the couple's first child, Evan James Springsteen.[148][149] On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a very private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends.[148][149] Their second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born on December 30, 1991;[148][149] and their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 1994.[149][150]  When the children reached school-age in the 1990s, Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey specifically to raise a family in a non-paparazzi environment. The grounds of his New Jersey home include a large swimming pool. The family owns and lives on a horse farm in Colts Neck and a home in Rumson; they also own homes in Los Angeles and Wellington, Florida.  Elder son Evan graduated from Boston College; he writes and performs his own songs and won the 2012 Singer/Songwriter Competition held during the Boston College's Arts Festival.[151] Their daughter Jessica is a nationally ranked champion equestrian,[152] and graduated from Duke University. She made her show-jumping debut with the Team USA in August 2014.[153] Their younger son, Sam, is a firefighter.[154]  It has been reported that the press conference regarding the 2009 Super Bowl XLIII half-time show was Springsteen's first press conference in more than 25 years.[155] However, he has appeared in a few radio interviews, most notably on NPR and BBC.[156] 60 Minutes aired one of his last extensive interviews on TV[157] before his tour to support his album, Magic. Springsteen has talked about his mental health struggles.[158]  Springsteen is an activist for LGBT rights and has spoken out many times as a strong supporter of gay marriage. In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: ""I've long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with Governor Corzine when he writes that 'The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is—a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law.'""[159] In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called ""The Four 2012"". Springsteen noted in the ad, ""I couldn't agree more with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now.""[160] In April 2016, Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro, North Carolina days before it was to take place to protest the state's newly passed Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, also referred to as the ""bathroom law"", which dictates which restrooms transgender people are permitted to use and prevents LGBT citizens from suing over human rights violations in the workplace. Springsteen released an official statement on his website. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) celebrated Springsteen's statement and he has received much praise and gratitude from the LGBT community. [161]  Springsteen was out riding his motorcycle on November 11, 2016 when it broke down and he was stranded alongside the road. A group of men from the Freehold American Legion in New Jersey were returning from a Veterans Day event on their motorcycles when they spotted Springsteen and stopped to help. Springsteen hitched a ride on the back of one of the men's motorcycles to a nearby restaurant where the group grabbed a round of drinks, for which Springsteen picked up the tab, while waiting for his ride.[162]  While rejecting religion in his earlier years, Bruce stated in his autobiography Born To Run, he has ""a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe in his power to save, love... but not to damn"". In terms of Catholic faith, he has stated that he ""came to ruefully and bemusedly understand that once you're a Catholic you're always a Catholic"" and ""I don't participate in my religion but I know somewhere... deep inside... I'm still on the team.""[163]  In an interview in 2017 with Tom Hanks, Springsteen admitted to having been a tax evader early in his career.[164]  Bands [ edit ]  Springsteen has been a member of, or has been backed by, several bands during his career, most notably the E Street Band. Earlier bands include the Rogues, the Castiles, Earth, Child, Steel Mill, the Sundance Blues Band, Dr Zoom and the Sonic Boom, and the Bruce Springsteen Band.[165] In October 1972 he formed a new band for the recording of his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which became known as The E Street Band, although the name was not used until September 1974.[166][167] Suki Lahav who was born on a kibbutz in Israel played violin with the E Street band as an unofficial member during live shows in the 1970s.[168]  The E Street Band performed on all of Springsteen's recorded works from his debut until 1982's Nebraska, a solo album on which Springsteen himself played all the instruments. The full band returned for the next album Born in the USA, but from 1988 to 1999, albums were recorded with session musicians. The E Street Band briefly reunited in 1995 for new contributions to the Greatest Hits compilation, and on a more permanent basis from 1999, since which time they have recorded more albums and performed a number of high-profile tours.

"© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  Beyonce and Jay Z are not currently planning to have a fourth baby via surrogate, despite an inaccurate tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We’re told it’s not true.  According to OK!, the superstar couple is looking to expand their family just seven months after the birth of their twins. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “With their marriage problems behind them, they don’t see a reason to wait.” This time around, however, the 36-year-old singer will supposedly hire a surrogate to carry her child.  “Surrogacy makes the most sense,” says the outlet’s supposed insider, who notes that Beyonce suffered a miscarriage prior to giving birth to 6-year-old daughter Blue Ivy in 2012. “They plan to cover every last expense to make the surrogate’s experience seamless,” adds the seemingly phony source.  But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to Beyonce and Jay Z, who exclusively tells us that they’re not exploring surrogacy at this time. Should the couple’s plans change sometime in the future, we’ll certainly report it, but the two simply aren’t planning for a fourth child right now.  Also read: Don't troll AKA about Valentine's Day  It’s true that Beyonce experienced some minor complications when she gave birth to her twins last June, which is probably why the tabloid is speculating that she would use a surrogate if she had more kids. However, that’s not a discussion that’s being had in the couple’s household.  It should be noted, OK! has very little insight when it comes to Beyonce and Jay Z’s family plans. Gossip Cop busted the unreliable tabloid in October 2016 for wrongly reporting that the couple was adopting a baby. The singer announced that she was pregnant with twins just months later. We also recently called out the publication for making up a bogus story about Beyonce and Jay fighting over whether to raise their kids in New York or Los Angeles.  In addition to fabricating articles about the famous couple’s children, the untrustworthy outlet also frequently alleges that Beyonce and Jay Z are headed for a divorce. Of course, time has proven many of the tabloid’s stories about the spouses to be completely wrong. Gossip Cop can now confirm that there’s no surrogacy in the works either.

"Steven Spielberg is credited with a pretty impressive list of films, which were made during his nearly 50-year career in Hollywood.  From “Jaws” to “Schindler’s List” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” the director has worked on some of the industry’s biggest movies.  But Spielberg won’t watch most of them.  “I don’t dwell,” he told E! on the red carpet for the premiere of “Speilberg,” the HBO documentary about his life and filmmaking career.  There is one exception, however.  “I’ll show my grandkids ‘E.T.’ for the first time,” he said. “And I’ll love sitting next to them and telling them that he doesn’t really die and ‘It’s only scary for a little while and then you grow to love him. I guide them through the experience.”  The 1982 film about an extraterrestrial trying to make it home is beloved by fans all over the world.  “Spielberg” will premiere on October 7 on HBO.",1
"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.  The No10 seed deflected a series of queries about the wrongful-death lawsuit filed on Thursday before she became overcome with emotion, prompting the moderator to request that journalists refrained from asking about the incident.  Venus Williams ‘at fault’ in fatal car crash, say Florida police Read more  “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and – yeah. I’m completely speechless. It’s just – yeah, I mean, I’m just …” a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.  The seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.  Williams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium’s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun‑splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.  The American – at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here – was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.  Mertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.  After a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China’s Qiang Wang.  The American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.  “You can’t prepare for everything,” Williams said. “I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That’s all I can say about it. That’s what I’ve learned.”  Palm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams’s vehicle.  Williams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons’ car when she continued through at about 5mph.  But police concluded the driver of Williams’s car “is at fault for violating the right of way”. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including “a cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers”.  Williams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as “heartbroken”.  One of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women’s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January – a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.",1

You'll never know—because it will be a secret. It could be happening right now. It will be the most secret secret wedding of all. Their friends will know literally right before it happens and no sooner, a source told Entertainment Tonight. So, Chris Hemsworth should keep a bag packed at all times, probably.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  ""She hasn't announced anything because she is being very secretive so only their friends will know and at the very last minute,"" the source said of Cyrus's wedding planning. ""This time they are doing everything their own way.""  Part of the reason for this is because when Cyrus and Hemsworth first got engaged in 2012, their plans to have a big wedding broke them up. ""The first time they announced their engagement in 2012, they felt such pressure to make it the most spectacular wedding in the world but that was the downfall of their relationship and lead to their break up,"" the source said. Stars: they're just like us.  Cyrus is on her own time table now, the source said, and just recently committed to the idea of a simple ""ranch wedding"" to honor her country roots.

So that ranch wedding may not actually happen. Maybe a Wrecking Ball-themed wedding. A secret Wrecking Ball wedding. Anything is possible. And also very secret.  Hemsworth and Cyrus have a good sense of humor about taking forever to have a wedding.

The list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence.

"It started with the #TimesUp blackout during January's Golden Globes, where a missive to wear all black to protest gender disparity resulted not only in some uniquely stunning looks — from Tracee Ellis Ross' satin turban to Clare Foy's Stella McCartney suit — but also in a unprecedented show of solidarity. For the first time, nearly everyone in Hollywood agreed that the red carpet could be a place to bring attention to real feats of activism. The icing on the cake was that it firmly established the connection between what actors wear and what they have to say. During each subsequent awards, it became clearer that the public began to expect that the clothing actresses wore would be a way to talk about the issues they care about. For fashion people, this was a moment to celebrate. We've always known that clothes should communicate something. But for that idea to become a cultural norm has done something amazing for the red carpet.",1

"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)  Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online.  In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes.  That changed dramatically the following month.  Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before.  Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.”  “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.”  And viewers did, apparently.    Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst)  Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.”  “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said.  Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.  Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)  [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly]  But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.  “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.”  Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.  [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?]  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported.  The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain.  On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel.  “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.”  [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’]  Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products.  According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.  “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.”  Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)  The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.  [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals]  The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.  1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here’s a look at Ivanka Trump’s early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.  The companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.  Still, despite the boycott, Trump’s line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon’s best-selling list last month, The Post’s Amy B Wang reported. The Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum spray was the top-selling item in the “Perfumes & Fragrances” category.

"Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's ""20/20"" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

"The creators of Sesame Street don’t want to have a hand in Melissa McCarthy’s new movie The Happytime Murders.  The Sesame Workshop is suing the production company behind the R-rated film, which was directed by Brian Henson, the son of Sesame Street puppeteer Jim Henson, claiming the raunchy movie could cause “irreparable injury” to the show’s brand, according to a lawsuit obtained by The Blast.  In their complaint, the Sesame Street creators claim that the film’s tagline, “No Sesame, All Street,” leads audiences to believe there is a connection to the show.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The film’s trailer, the say, “deliberately confuses consumers into mistakenly believing that Sesame is associated with, has allowed, or has even endorsed or produced the movie and tarnishes Sesame’s brand.”  In response, STX Entertainment, the production company behind The Happytime Murders, issued a statement from lawyer puppet Fred Esq. “STX loved the idea of working closely with Brian Henson and the Jim Henson Company to tell the untold story of the active lives of Henson puppets when they’re not performing in front of children,” Fred said, on behalf of STX.  “Happytime Murders is the happy result of that collaboration and we’re incredibly pleased with the early reaction to the film and how well the trailer has been received by its intended audience. While we’re disappointed that Sesame Street does not share in the fun, we are confident in our legal position. We look forward to introducing adult moviegoers to our adorably unapologetic characters this summer,” his statement continued.  Fred Esq. STX Productions  In their complaint, the Sesame Street creators say their show has spent 50 years building its “reputation for wholesome educational programming,” while the trailer for the new film depicts “explicit, profane, drug-using, misogynistic, violent, copulating, and even ejaculating puppets.”  According to the complaint, the film’s explicit content “diluted and defiled Sesame’s beloved Sesame Street children’s television show.”  WARNING: TRAILER CONTAINS EXPLICIT CONTENT  The film’s logline describes the movie as “a filthy comedy set in the underbelly of Los Angeles where puppets and humans coexist.” McCarthy stars as a detective who teams up with a puppet private eye to track down a serial killer. In addition to being directed by Henson’s son, the film was produced by The Jim Henson Company’s Henson Alternative banner, On The Day Productions, and was executive produced by Henson’s daughter Lisa Henson.  The movie has earned substantial buzz, with the R-rated trailer wracking up nearly 1.7 million views on YouTube.  Despite describing the film as “indescribably crude,” the complaint makes clear that Sesame Street is not trying to stop the movie from hitting theaters. “It is only [the filmmaker’s] deliberate choice to invoke and commercially misappropriate Sesame’s name and goodwill in marketing the movie – and thereby cause consumers to conclude that Sesame is somehow associated with the movie – that has infringed on and tarnished the Sesame Street mark and goodwill.”  The show’s creators are asking that the film pull its advertising, in addition to unspecified damages.  The Happytime Murders, also starring Joel McHale and Elizabeth Banks, is set to hit theaters Aug. 17.",1

"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.",0

"0  NBC has ordered a trio of additional episodes for the new drama series Manifest, but this is not a case of playing it safe. Traditionally when a network series debuts during the fall season, it does so with 13 episodes in the can. Then, depending on how the show does ratings-wise, a network might order nine additional episodes (called a “back nine”) to consist of a full season’s worth of episodes—22 in total. With Manifest, however, NBC is taking a page out of cable’s book by allowing the drama series to conclude its first season with just 16 episodes, rather than have to draw the story out to 22.  The show revolves around the passengers of a flight that experienced turbulence on its way back to New York City, during which the power in the plane went out. The plane recovered quickly, but when it landed in New York City the flight’s passengers and crew were shocked to discover they’ve all been missing and presumed dead for more than five years. Each week’s episode features a procedural element as the passengers returned to lives that had moved on without them, as well as an ongoing mythology hook regarding what exactly happened to the plane.  This order of three additional episodes is good news both for the writers of Manifest and fans of the show. Back when Damon Lindelof was making LOST, he and co-showrunner Carlton Cuse famously lobbied ABC to let them set a finite endpoint for the series. A show that serialized could only go on for so long, and by Season 3 they were running out of the steam necessary to create 22 hours of content each year. ABC reluctantly acquiesced, and the subsequent seasons consisted of no more than 18 episodes each year. Now seasons of 13 episodes are the norm on cable networks, while broadcast networks continue to stick to the 22-episode seasons to fill out air time necessary for ads.  So yes, Manifest will at the very least conclude its first season, and a Season 2 pickup is probably likely if the ratings remain strong. The show airs on NBC Mondays at 10pm ET.",1
"Rashida Jones, pictured Oct. 14 at the Los Angeles premiere of the play ""Sell/Buy/Date,"" will executive produce a potential new television series for AMC. (Rachel Luna/Getty Images)  It’s been a little over a year since “Kevin Can Wait” killed off Erinn Hayes’s character after just one season, a very weird move, given that she played a lead character — Donna Gable, Kevin’s wife of 20 years. To add fuel to the fire burning inside upset viewers' hearts, the CBS sitcom replaced Hayes with Leah Remini, Kevin James’s former co-star from “King of Queens.” Ratings took a dip, and the network eventually axed the show in May.  Donna, while a high-profile case, wasn’t the only mistreated wife in sitcom history, and this hasn’t gone unnoticed. AMC Networks announced Friday that it has a project in development called “Kevin Can F*** Himself,” from creator Valerie Armstrong and executive producers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack.  The series aims to expose “the secret life of a woman we all grew up watching: the sitcom wife,” the network said in a statement. “A beauty paired with a less attractive, dismissive, caveman-like husband who gets to be a jerk because she’s a nag and he’s ‘funny.'"" The show aims to illuminate said secret life by switching between “single-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness.”  Hayes even tweeted about it:  This project is the second buzzed about this week that directly challenges long-established Hollywood tropes. The first? “Isn’t It Romantic,” an upcoming movie that centers on a cynical woman (Rebel Wilson) who faces her worst nightmare when she gets trapped in a cheesy romantic comedy. (Yes, the same movie Wilson was promoting when she incorrectly claimed to be the “first-ever plus-sized girl” to lead a rom-com.)  AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom — as well as workplace drama “Rainy Day People” — under its “script-to-series” development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts.  “Under the approach, AMC foregoes the traditional pilot process and instead opens writers' rooms to develop scripts for several episodes and a detailed look at a potential first season before deciding whether to move to a straight-to-series order,” Deadline reported last year.  So while there’s no guarantee “Kevin Can F*** Himself” will make it to the finish line, AMC programming president David Madden did note that the network has had “great experiences” with the creative team behind it. Things are looking up. We (Kevin) Can’t Wait!  Read more:  Wondering how ‘Kevin Can Wait’ will get rid of Erinn Hayes? Well, they’re killing her off.  ‘Kevin Can Wait’ isn’t the first sitcom to have a character death. Here’s how 8 other shows handled it.

"A Madison, Miss., precinct worker offers a voter a ""I voted"" sticker after voting in party primaries on Tuesday, June 3, 2014. Mississippi's new voter ID law was put to its first test in Tuesday’s primaries. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)Note: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting.Voter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.Part of this litigation — and any rational debate about the issue generally — hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice.First, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don’t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they’re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win.[Here’s the completely legal way to ‘rig’ an election]Second, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud … that ID laws aren’t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including ""registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,"" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations.This sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you’ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren’t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop.Instead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens.I’ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I’ve been following reports wherever they crop up.[New evidence that voter ID laws 'skew democracy' in favor of white Republicans]To be clear, I’m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix.So far, I’ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below.To put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.Some of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I’d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.In just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn’t include voters without ID who didn’t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away?Correction: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School.Credible allegations of potential fraud since 2000 that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the pollsNote: tracking the allegations — even those that may end up disproven — can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not — please — examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well.May 2014: Ben Hodzic allegedly voted at the polls in the name of his brother in the Catskill School District Board of Education election in Catskill, NY.[1] Nov. 2013: Mark Atlas allegedly voted at the polls in the name of someone else in the municipal election in Worcester, MA.[2] Sep. 2013: At least four, and possibly 20-24, Hasidic voters in the South Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, allegedly attempted to vote at the polls under others’ names in the municipal primary elections for New York City.[3] Mar. 2013: Kristina Bentrim went to vote at the polls in the Cedar Rapids, IA, special election on a gambling referendum, and was allegedly told that someone had voted in her name.[4] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Angela Cooney in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Angela Cooney listed as dying 4 years earlier.[5] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Evan Dixon in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Evan Dixon listed as dying 11 years earlier.[6] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Alejandro Guerrero in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Alejandro Guerrero listed as dying 5 years earlier.[7] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. 2012: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2012 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney.[8] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. June 2011: Hazel Brionne Woodard apparently arranged for her son Mark James Jr. to vote at the polls in the name of his father, Mark James Sr., in the municipal runoff elections in Tarrant County, TX.[9] Nov. 2010: Four ballots may have been cast in the general election in South Carolina in the name of voters who had previously died (Ed Louis Johnson, Elbert R. Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable. (Law enforcement agents believe that the ballot of Elbert R. Thompson may have been confused with that of his son, Elbert Thompson.) Another 203 allegations of deceased voters in the same election were revealed to be either clerical error or coincidence.[10] May 2009: Lorenzo Antonio Almanza, Jr., after voting himself, apparently cast a ballot at the polls in the name of his incarcerated brother, Orlando Almanza, in the 2009 election for the Progreso Independent School District Board, TX. (His mother, Reyna Almanza, vouched for him, and was separately convicted.)[11] Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Forrest Downie in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Forrest Downie listed as dying 3 years earlier.[12] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Scott Hagloch in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Scott Hagloch listed as dying 2 years earlier.[13] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Mar. 2008: Jack Carol Crowder III allegedly impersonated his father (Jack Carol Crowder), using his father’s voter registration card at the polls in the March 2008 presidential primary election in Baytown, TX.[14] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of James E. Barnes, who died in 2006. This may (or may not) have been the result of clerical error confusing the man with his son, James W. Barnes; it is not clear whether the pollbooks were reviewed to determine whether fraud or clerical error was the cause.[15] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of Stanley Dwayne Echols, who was at the hospital and did not vote.[16] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. June 2007: The two contending city council candidates in a municipal runoff election in Hoboken, NJ, both reported instances in the election in which someone went to the polls and found out that someone else had voted in their place.[17] It is not clear how many instances there were, or how the candidates learned of them. It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in a municipal budget referendum in Stonington, CT, in the name of Jane M. Drury, who died in 2000.[18] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Rosalie B. Simpson died in August 2004, but a vote was apparently recorded at the polls in her name in the general election in Seattle, WA.[19] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Frank Sanchez, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[20] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Someone apparently signed on the pollbook line for Rose-Mary G. McGee, in Albuquerque, NM, during the general election.[21] Nov. 2004: Dwight Adkins, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[22] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Three people at the polls in Westchester County, NY, were given provisional ballots (in New York, “affidavit ballots”) in the general election because someone had allegedly signed the poll books in their place.[23] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. Nov. 2004: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the general election in Milwaukee, WI, in the name of an individual who had died several years earlier.[24] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2004: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2004 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney. [25] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. Jan. 2004: Mark Lacasse apparently voted at the polls in the presidential primary in Londonderry, NH, in the name of his father, who was away on business at the time. [26] Nov. 2002: Shasta Nicole Crayton apparently voted in her sister’s name at the polls in the general election in Dadeville, AL.[27] In several municipal, primary, and general elections in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, votes were cast in-person in Philadephia, PA, by an individual named Joseph Cheeseboro and by an individual named Joseph J. Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28] In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records. In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records. According to Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram, the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of four “recent” voters allegedly matched the corresponding information on earlier death certificates, indicating that the votes were cast after the individuals’ deaths. It is not clear at which elections these votes were cast, or how many, if any, of these votes were cast at the polls (rather than absentee). It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.[31]Credible allegations of impersonation at the polls since 2000 that would not likely be prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls, or attempted impersonation at the polls since 2000 that was actually prevented without a strict ID requirement(Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)Nov. 2012: Linda Earlette Wells apparently voted at the polls in the general election in Germantown, MD, in the name of her mother (Beatrice Moore Wells), who had died in June 2011. She apparently used her mother’s ID to cast the ballot.[32] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Caitlin A. Legacki in the general election; Legacki was in Missouri at the time. However, in 2012, New Hampshire had a requirement that voters show photo ID at the polls; officials believe that either someone showed a fraudulent ID in Legacki’s name or (according to them, more likely) that a clerical error incorrectly listed Legacki as voting.[33] Nov. 2010 (and Nov. 2008): Ortencia Segura-Segura apparently voted at the polls in the name of Marisela Reyna in the general elections in Reno, NV, using a fraudulently procured Nevada driver’s license.[34] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Mar. 2010: Delores McMillian and her mother were both election officials in Dallas. During the primary election, McMillian used one other voter’s registration number to try to cast a ballot in her name. (Her mother may have used more, but died during the course of the investigation.) A fellow election worker apparently blocked the attempt.[35] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. Nov. 2008 (and others): Mary Ann Comparin used a fake driver’s license in the name of her long-dead sister, Norma Gerrish Collins, to vote in her sister’s name in the 2008 general election in Bexar County, TX. [36] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2008: Ricardo Lopez-Munguia apparently voted (whether absentee or in person is not clear) in the name of Gustavo Carranza-Madrigal in the general election in Escondido, CA. Lopez-Munguia possessed a fraudulent California driver’s license.[37] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: Andrea Peña was apparently recruited by mayor Omar Vela to vote in the school board election in Progreso, TX; Peña was apparently given someone else’s voter registration card and told that pollworkers would make sure there were no problems. An election judge (more usually known as a pollworker) actually cast Peña’s ballot for her.[38] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: in the same Progreso school board election, Jessica Rangel claimed that Guadalupe Vela Sr. tried to convince Rangel to recruit a friend to vote with someone else’s voter registration card, and claimed that “they had people that worked the election on their side.” Rangel apparently refused.[39] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Aug. 2007: Vancy Voorhies, a pollworker in Davidson County, TN, apparently voted at the polls in the mayoral election; at her ill elderly cousin’s request, she signed her cousin’s name in the pollbook (with her own initials to indicate the permission), asked her cousin how she preferred to vote, and cast the ballot accordingly.[40] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a misguided pollworker from casting invalid ballots. June 2007: A homeless man was apparently paid $10 to use the name of Kevin Logan to vote in a city council runoff race in Hoboken, NJ. After a challenge by a local resident, the effort failed. [41] Sept. 2005: Memphis, TN, pollworkers Verline Mayo, Gertrude Otteridge, and Mary McClatcher apparently cast at least three votes at the polls in the names of others, including two in the names of dead voters, in a special election for a state Senate seat.[42] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. May 2005: Macon, MS, resident Kendrick Slaughter testified that he saw Ike Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, urging Bridgette Brown to “go in [to the precinct pollsite] and vote, to use any name, and that no one was going to say anything.” It is not clear whether Bridgette Brown did cast a vote at the polls in the name of another, but it is clear that pollworkers under Ike Brown’s direction stood ready to commit or facilitate other forms of voter fraud.[43] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2000: A vote was cast in the general election in Miami, FL, in the name of Andre Alismé, who had died in 1997. The voter apparently used either a passport or driver’s license and a voter registration card in Alismé’s name.[44][1] Jim Planck, Alleged Fraud Casts Pall Over Catskill School Vote, Daily Mail, May 29, 2014.[2] Alli Knothe, 2 Charged with Voter Fraud in Worcester, Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 4, 2013.[3] Max Rivlin-Nadler et al., Brazen Voting Fraud Alleged Among Ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, Gothamist, Sep. 11, 2013, http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/voter_fraud_attempts.php.[4] Jason Noble, Schultz, Many Iowans Still Solidly Back Voter ID Laws, Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2013.[5] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[6] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[7] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[8] N.C.

"EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp and his former business managers will not be kicking off a potential messy and revealing trial over the Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald star’s long-held fraud claims of $25 million next month after all.  After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear. While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.  Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one, the managed mediation between Depp’s lawyer and TMG’s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP comes after the actor’s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D.C.’s Brown Rudick failed late last month to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back. It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor. Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.  Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.  Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed. The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.  Following the submission of that paperwork, the settlement agreement is expected to be approved before the August 15 trial start date, which is basically a moot note on the calendar at this point. A fact that will make Warner Bros very happy as sources say that the studio was not looking forward to a public hearing of The Crimes of Grindelwald’s marketing campaign and opening this fall of the latest installment in this J.K. Rowling’s franchise being flooded by headlines of Depp’s allegedly excessive spending habits and dwindling financial resources.  While the bloodletting between the actor and TMG is over now, the settlement in that matter does not, however, end the other litigation tidal waves that the Pirates of the Caribbean star is wading through. Depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorneyJacob Bloom and his. Claiming cahoots with TMG, the actor went after Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP for $30 million last fall. They went right back after him a couple of months later as the actor seemed for a while to be shedding lawyers at an alarming rate  In addition, Depp’s legal dance card was hit last week with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.  So, let’s call it one down, a lot more to go when it comes to Johnny Depp and the courts right now.  In terms of the now-dimmed fraud lawsuit that started all this back in early 2017, representatives for TMG contacted by Deadline had no comment on the outcome of the Saturday and Sunday sit-down. Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the matter.",1

"The hottest stars stepped out for the 2017 Latin GRAMMY Awards to celebrate the biggest night in Latin music at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday night.  The three-hour show, hosted by Roselyn Sanchez and Jaime Camil, included sizzling performances by Luis Fonsi, Steve Aoki, Alessia Cara, J Balvin, Maluma and Person of the Year Alejandro Sanz, among others.  Juanes and Luis Fonsi were among the first winners of the night, with the ""Despactio"" singer taking home all four awards he was nominated for, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Shakira, who is currently on vocal rest and absent from the ceremony, won Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album for her latest record, El Dorado.  ET caught up with Fonsi, who was nominated for four Latin GRAMMYs, before the ceremony, where he expressed how much the awards show means to him.  EXCLUSIVE: Luis Fonsi on His Influential 20-Year Career and His Mission to Help Rebuild Puerto Rico  “The Latin GRAMMYs to me are the most important music award for Latin music and to have four nominations is certainly an honor,” said Fonsi, who won his first Latin GRAMMY in 2009 for “Aqui Estoy Yo,” which was awarded Song of the Year.  ""To have Record of the Year and Song of the Year nominations are two huge categories, those two have a lot of weight,” he added. “But, you can’t control whether you win or lose and all the artists that are nominated are amazing, so I’m really just truly blessed to be among a great group of artists that I admire.""  Lin-Manuel Miranda was also honored with the President's Merit Award for his outstanding and numerous contributions to the Latin community, including his relief efforts for Puerto Rico following the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Upon taking the stage, the Hamilton creator thanked his team and his wife, Vanessa Nadal.  ""My people! Thank you, it's an honor to be here,"" Miranda began his Spanglish speech. ""No one gets here alone,"" he added before expressing how proud he was of the Latino community and dedicating the award to Puerto Rico.  ""I know I'm a weird theater kid here, with a weird accent,"" he continued. ""But let's keep collaborating and show the world that Latinos can change the world when we collaborate.""

"Chrissy Teigen and John Legend traded in their (faux) winter wonderland in Los Angeles for a holiday getaway in the desert.  The duo and their adorable daughter Luna, spent Christmas “in the canyon,” according to the crooner, who shared a photo of himself smiling with Luna in his arms and a picturesque desert in the background.  Christmas in the canyon A post shared by John Legend (@johnlegend) on Dec 25, 2017 at 6:07pm PST  The 1-year-old tyke was all smiles too, as she played around outside in a red sweater emblazoned with ""Merry Christmas,"" black pants, and tiny black booties. “hommmme home on the range...Merry Christmas!,” the Cravings cookbook author wrote alongside several photos of the family, which showed Luna walking around with their bulldog, Chrissy and John cuddling her, and the trio posing for a family photo.  Merry Christmas! A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Dec 25, 2017 at 6:14pm PST  Teigen and Legend both went casual too for their celebration, with the model sporting a black sweater, black pants, and booties, and Legend opting for a sweater topped with a palm tree print. In addition to giving a glimpse into their Christmas activities outdoors, Teigen also revealed what they would be eating that night, tweeting, “Merry Christmas!! Tonight’s menu, @TylerFlorence’s beef wellington, my creamy onions, roasted carrots, balsamic bacon brussels, garlic smashed potatoes, honey butter rolls and @Nigella_Lawson’s INSANE cider and 5-spice bundt cake with salty caramel sauce!” Yum!  The pair has a lot to celebrate heading into the new year (aside from Chrissy’s upcoming second cookbook), given that they’re expecting their second child in 2018. Teigen announced the news on Instagram last month, sharing a video where she pointed at her stomach and asked her baby girl, ""Luna! What's in here?""  “Baby,” Luna replied. Always the card, Chrissy captioned the clip, ""it's john's!""",1
"Blake Shelton is releasing a third track, “Turnin’ Me On,” from his album Texoma Shore and it’s a love song inspired by his girlfriend Gwen Stefani.  The new release from Blake has the country singer and “The Voice” coach singing about all the things that turn him on about his girlfriend of 3 years, Gwen.  “She’s turning me on, turning me on / Pushing my buttons like it ain’t no thing / If I’m what she wants, she gets what she wants / The neon’s buzzing when she pulls that string / Turning me on like it’s her job / Sometimes I think she must get off on / Turning me on, turning me on.”  Blake began writing the song by himself and as he got on a roll, he asked his songwriter friend to help him finish it.  “We’re sitting on my bus one day early in 2017 and I think I was in Baton Rouge,” said Blake. “I was up there alone and I had my guitar, started playing a little melody that I was hearing in my head and next thing you know I started writing a song. I wrote a verse, then I wrote a chorus, then I realized it was going somewhere and I felt good about it. Like I always [have] in the last couple of years, I called up my friend Jessi Alexander and said, ‘Man, I think I’m onto something and I need somebody way better than me to try to bring this thing home.’ She and I and Josh Osborne ended up writing this song, I’m super proud of it—and it’s not hard to figure out who this song is about.”  After hearing Blake record the new song, what did Gwen think of her beau’s ode to her? “She liked it,” Blake told Seth Meyers. “I didn’t say I wrote the song about her then. I just said I wrote the song and then she figured it out. There’s a line that says ‘She’s Revlon red,’ because she’s the Revlon girl.”  “And when my body’s beside hers / There ain’t no turning back / She’s Revlon red in the blackest night / Lighting up the room in the world just like she’s turnin’ me on.”  “Turnin’ Me On,” featured on Blake’s current album Texoma Shore, is the follow up to Blake’s No. 1 hit “I’ll Name the Dogs,” and most recent single, “I Lived It.”",0
"Fans of Vanderpump Rules have experienced a roller coaster of emotions in Season 6. From the season premiere, Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor were off to a rough start when cheating rumors around Jax bubbled to the surface and turned out to be true. From there, the hits kept coming for Brittany and their relationship. From audio recordings to reiki masters, last summer was a rocky road for Brittany, who stayed by her man after he cheated on her.  In her recent interview with The Daily Dish podcast, Brittany shared with hosts Rachael Roberts and Megan Segura all the ups and downs — and even the regrets — she had in her relationship last summer.  ""I didn't really take time for myself after everything happened over the summer, like, after he cheated and everything,"" Brittany explained. ""I really didn't have time to just even get away from him."" This created a lot of confusing feelings for the Kentucky native. ""I still wanted him to be around,"" she admitted. ""I just felt very betrayed, betrayed after everything, of course, this summer that had happened.""  On Monday night's episode, Jax told Brittany he wanted to take a break in the wake of his fling with Faith Stowers. The couple have since reconciled and seem do be doing better than ever. ""I'm so much happier now,"" Brittany said of her current relationship with Jax. ""Everything's better.""  While things are going smoothly for the pair now, did Brittany ever wish she'd been the one to initiate the breakup when she discovered Jax had been unfaithful? ""I do now because of how he embarrassed me so bad, but I just — I don't know. I just wasn't in that head space. It's hard to explain because I was going through so many emotions.""  To hear more about their relationship, including if Brittany ever hooked up with the new SUR barback, Adam, listen to the podcast episode above.

"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.",0
"Pippa Middleton knows what it’s like to have someone steal the spotlight at a wedding – in part, because she herself did exactly that at her own sister’s wedding. Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton‘s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa’s dress than Kate’s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.  Since then, Pippa’s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride – and in this particular circumstance, it’s almost a given that it will happen to her.  According to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry’s friend’s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry’s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she’s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.  Sources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.”  According to the same source, Pippa is now employing a “no ring, no guest” policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses – which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it’s Prince Harry we’re talking about, you think he wouldn’t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law’s wedding, given that he took her to a friend’s wedding?  What do you guys think? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Image credit to Meghan Markle // via Instagram",0
"With Turkey Day just around the corner, store shelves are already lined with Christmas decorations and retailers across the country are preparing for Black Friday and its assortment of clearance sales.  We also have another long list of new TV shows, movies and Netflix Originals headed to the streaming service this December, including some very big releases---and no, I'm not talking about Bride of Chucky, though that scary movie is arriving next month just a tad late for Halloween.  Fortunately, Netflix subscribers have plenty of great content to look forward to. Let's take a look at some highlights before moving on to the big list of releases.  Undoubtedly the biggest release of the month is Avengers: Infinity War (pictured above) which lands on Netflix Christmas Day. Watching Thanos do battle against the arrayed forces of good on our planet and across the galaxies should be a nice way to relax after Christmas dinner. It should also get audiences in the mood for Avengers 4 which is slated for a May 3rd 2019 theatrical release. I liked Infinity War a lot more than Age of Ultron, though I did have a few quibbles with the film.  I'm even more excited for the release of the eighth and final season of Voltron: Legendary Defender, though the ""final"" part is kind of bumming me out. All good things must come to an end, but I feel like the show was really hitting its stride in Season 7 and it's so soon now that it will all be coming to an end. Just 13 episodes remain. If you're not watching Voltron on Netflix, you really should be. It's fun for kids and grown-ups alike.  Other fantastical fare for December includes 2004's Hellboy (December 1st) and the 2009 sci-fi drama District 9 (Dec 4th) a clever dystopian film that cuts rather close to the bone.  Perhaps just as exciting---if not more so---than Voltron, we have Season 1 of 3 Below: Tales of Arcadia which comes to Netflix on December 21st. This is the second series in Guillermo del Toro's animated project that began with the absolutely wonderful Trollhunters. We were introduced to the star characters of 3 Below in the final few episodes of that show. I'm so excited to see what happens here. I adored Trollhunters as did my kids. This time around, instead of trolls we get aliens. Should be neat.  Here's the trailer:  I'm also looking forward to the 4-part miniseries Watership Down, produced by Netflix and the BBC. The animated show includes voice actors like Sir Ben Kingsley (Gandhi), John Boyega (Star Wars) and many more. I remember the original movie adaptation of the excellent book frightening me quite a lot. Rabbits aren't supposed to be this twisted. It lands on Netflix on Christmas Day.  For more comedic titles both Friday and Friday After Next hit Netflix on December 1st. The hilarious British zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead lands the same day.  Meanwhile, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, a Netflix original that follows fairly close on the heels of Disney's live-action Jungle Book, finds its way to the streaming service on December 7th. The movie was directed by Andy Serkis (Gollum from Lord of the Rings, Snoke in the new Star Wars movies, Caesar in Planet of the Apes, and so on and so forth) and was originally a Warner Bros. film slated for theatrical release.  The rights were sold to Netflix, however, so we can save a buck or two and see this from the living room couch. I'm honestly not sure what to expect, but I have nothing but admiration for Serkis as a creative. There's a bunch of big names attached as voice actors, but I'm particularly glad to see The Americans star Mathhew Rhys who was simply outstanding in that show (as was Keri Russell.)  Here's the trailer:  I think it looks quite good---and quite different from The Jungle Book.  There's tons more, including a plethora of new Netflix Originals. Here's everything coming to Netflix in December 2018:  December 1st  Memories of Alhambra (Season 1)  8 Mile (2002)  Astro Boy (2009)  Battle (2018) Netflix Original Movie  Bride of Chucky (1998)  Christine (1983)  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009)  Crossroads: One Two Jaga (2018) Netflix Original Movie  Friday (1995)  Friday After Next (2002)  Hellboy (2004)  Man vs Wild with Sunny Leone (Season 1)  Meet Joe Black (1998)  My Bloody Valentine (2009)  Next Friday (2000)  Reindeer Games (2000)  Seven Pounds (2008)  Shaun of the Dead (2004)  Terminator Salvation (2009)  The Big Lebowski (1998)  The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass (Season 5)  The Last Dragon (1985)  The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997)  December 2nd  The Lobster (2015)  December 3rd  Blue Planet (Season 1)  Hero Mask (Season 1) Netflix Original Anime  The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot (Season 2) Netflix Original Series  December 4th  District 9 (2009)  December 6th  Happy!

"TV host Anne-Marie Losique has again defended Ben Affleck after a 2004 interview of the pair went viral amid the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  Appearing on Weekend Sunrise on Sunday, Anne-Marie insisted that her relations with Ben were purely 'professional,' and that he 'never asked me to go to his room or anything like that.'  In the video from 2004, the journalist is seen sitting on Ben's lap as she interviews him, the actor tells her she should go 'topless' then puts his head on her chest.  'He never asked me to go to his room or anything like that': TV host Anne-Marie Losique defends Ben Affleck over their VERY intimate interview... amid the Harvey Weinstein scandal  'In all my career, I never go roam around in rooms and suites of actors and producers by the way,' Anne-Marie said.  'What I did with Ben and what we did, which was completely mutual, it was in front of cameras, and studio executives, agents, other journalists etc, and in front of like 20 people,' she said.  'It started when the cameras rolled, it stopped when the cameras stopped rolling.'  Speaking up: Appearing on Weekend Sunrise on Sunday, Anne-Marie insisted that her relations with Ben were purely 'professional'  She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more.  'That's it. The rest we had very courteous conversation, very respectful. He never asked me to go to his room or anything like that and never, nothing like that!'  She insisted the pair played the 'game' in interviews for ten years and she said she didn't like that the 2004 interview was being associated with the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  Anne-Marie also said she wasn't a 'victim,' despite what people might think.  All for show: She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more  Making headlines: Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein (pictured) drama, Anne-Marie said she was once asked up to his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away'  Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein drama, Anne-Marie said he once asked her to visit his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away.'  'Professional settings have to stay professional,' she said, but defended his victims who unknowingly went up to his hotel suite with him.  'When one says no, it's no,' she added.  Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben.  'This was for the camera. You have to understand that we have done dozens and dozens of interviews like that. It was for a show I was producing, so I was not at all a victim,' she said.  The video starts by showing Anne-Marie sitting on Ben's lap facing him as he's heard saying: 'They would like it better if you did the show topless.'  Having her say: Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben  He then turns her around so she can face the camera before he places his head on her chest.  'This is a lovely perfume you have on,' he says as the two hold each other.  He then says: 'You usually show a lot more cleavage than this. What's the story? Why are you covering it up today?'  'It's Sunday morning,' she responds.  'It's Sunday morning? That never stopped you before from getting them ti****s out,' Ben says back to her in the interview that lasted for more than five minutes.  But despite what the video appears to show, Anne-Marie said it 'has been blown out of proportion.'  She told the publication she had an uncomfortable encounter with Harvey, years ago.  'He did invite me once at the Toronto Film Festival to go up to his suite for an interview. Of course I did not go. He said, ""I would be more comfortable in my suite."" I said, ""Umm, no."" I am not saying something would have happened, but I made sure nothing happened,' she said.  Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party.  Annamarie Tendler, who is the author of The Daily Face and Pin It, asked for an apology from the actor over the alleged incident in a Tweet on Wednesday.  Claims: Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party  'I would also love to get an apology from Ben Affleck who grabbed my a** at a Golden Globes party in 2014,' she Tweeted.  She followed that tweet up with more detail, saying: 'He walked by me, cupped my butt and pressed his finger into my crack.  'I guess he tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way and oops touched my butt instead of my lower back?  'Like most women in these situations I didn't say anything but I have thought a lot about what I'd say if I ever saw him again,' she concluded.  Writer and comedian, Jen Statsky, who is known for her work on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, also tweeted about Annamarie's allegations.  Controversial: Ben had made a statement condemning Harvey's alleged abusive actions, saying he was 'saddened and angry' over the 'sickening' claims, which was slammed by Annamarie and Jen  'I was also at this party and *multiple* friends had this same exact experience,' she wrote on Twitter.  Ben had made a statement condemning Harvey's alleged abusive actions, saying he was 'saddened and angry' over the 'sickening' claims, which was slammed by Annamarie and Jen.  The statement was also slammed by Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, who called Ben a liar.  Actress Hilary Burton meanwhile said she 'didn't forget' when Ben 'grabbed her breasts' on TRL, in 2003.  He since apologised to Hilary, in a Tweet.",1
"Michael Jackson’s daughter, Paris, thanked the late music icon “for the magic” in an Instagram post early Tuesday morning, on what would have been the King of Pop’s 59th birthday.  “Birthday wishes to the love of my life, the one person who showed me what passion truly was, the one that gave me solid morals to live by and how to dream,” she wrote.  The 19-year-old, who made headlines Sunday for speaking out against “Nazi, white supremacist jerks” at the MTV Video Music Awards, shared a 2001 photo of herself kissing her dad. In it, Jackson is seen wearing his iconic white sequin glove.  “I will never feel love again the way I did with you,” her post continued. “You are always with me and I am always with you. Though I am not you, and you are not me, I know with all my being that we are one. And our souls will never change in that way. Thank you for the magic, forever and always.”  In what Rolling Stone dubbed as her “first-ever in-depth interview” following her father’s June 2009 death, the model-actress opened up about the close-knit relationship she had with her father, saying, “I feel him with me all the time.” She was 11 years old when she spoke at his memorial service on July 7, 2009, calling him the “best father you could ever imagine.”  Jackson, who is currently filming the second season of Fox’s “Star,” is the sole daughter of mother, Debbie Rowe, and father. She has two brothers, older sibling Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and the younger Prince Michael Jackson II.",1

"Michelle Obama has some summer workout motivation for you The former First Lady is keeping up her White House traditions  Michelle Obama may not be in the White House anymore, but she is determined to continue with some of the traditions she established while she was there. The former First Lady has revealed that she still hosts regular ""boot camp weekends"" with her friends like she used to, and took to Instagram to share some photos from their most recent meetup.  GALLERY: See inside Michelle and Barack Obama's new home  Posting a series of snaps of herself and a group of women exercising in the park, Michelle wrote: ""When I was at the White House, I often hosted boot camp weekends for my close girlfriends. It didn't matter that we were all at varying fitness levels. Our boot camp weekends were a reminder that if we want to keep taking care of others, we need to take care of ourselves first. And even though I'm no longer at the White House, I've continued this tradition and wanted to share some photos.""  VIEW GALLERY  Michelle Obama hosted a boot camp weekend for her friends  The mother-of-two continued: ""My girlfriends have been there for me through all kinds of life transitions over the years – including a pretty big one recently! – and we've done our best to stay healthy together. Whether it's a boot camp or a walk around the neighbourhood, I hope you and your crew can find some time this summer to be healthy together.""  Keeping fit and healthy is incredibly important to Michelle, and she previously pioneered the Let's Move! Public health campaign to aim to reduce childhood obesity and encourage a healthy lifestyle in children. The 53-year-old said she always wants to be in the best health she can possibly be, telling Prevention: ""I always want to be on the cusp of being in the best shape that I can be. What I'm discovering is that the older you get, the more work you have to do to stay there. When I was younger, I could eat whatever I wanted, as long as I exercised; or if I didn't exercise and just watched what I ate, I'd maintain. Well, now I have to do both.""  VIEW GALLERY  The former First Lady wants to maintain her White House traditions  Michelle also revealed how she had changed her workouts over time.

"HARTFORD, Conn. — A Connecticut man who pretended to be pop stars like Justin Bieber and Harry Styles to entice young girls into performing sexual acts during online video chats has been sentenced to 17 years in prison.  Federal prosecutors say 50-year-old John Eastman, of Waterbury, was also sentenced Tuesday to a lifetime of probation.  Prosecutors say Eastman contacted girls through online video chatting services in 2012 using screen names such as justin.bieber727 and Harry.Styles888 and enticed them into sexually explicit conduct, which he then recorded and saved on his computer. He also used previously recorded videos the singers had uploaded on YouTube to further deceive the girls.  He was arrested in May 2013 and pleaded guilty in March.  Eastman has 31 past convictions, including for sex-related crimes.",0
"The actor told friends he’s responsible for encouraging Brad to reignite his romance with former wife Jennifer Aniston, who George has always had a close friendship with.  Just last weekend, George and Brad were spotted out together for the first time in more than five years – marking a new chapter in their friendship.  The pair enjoyed dinner with other Hollywood heavyweights including Sean Penn, Bradley Cooper and Laura Dern in LA, with George even using Jen Aniston’s private bodyguard.  And it seems George didn’t hold back in telling dinner guests just how happy he is that Brad and Jen have reunited.  Brad, Jen and George have been friends for years Getty  ‘George has always hated Ange and really disliked the way she controlled Brad throughout their marriage,’ says a source.  ‘He loved Brad and Jen when they were together and was devastated when they split – especially when he found out it was because of Ange, who he’d never heard good things about.  ‘So when Ange and Brad split, George was the first person to call him and reconnect – and also plant the seed about reaching out to Jen.  ‘He’d stayed in contact with Jen even after her divorce from Brad – and they’ve never stopped being close.  When George heard that her marriage to Justin was on the rocks, he really stepped up efforts to reconcile the pair.  ‘Now it’s happened, he’s out there telling anyone who’ll listen that he’s responsible. He’s pretty chuffed about it.’  While Brad would’ve been more than happy to finally catch up with George and Sean – friends who he wasn’t allowed to hang out with while he was married to Ange – one notable no-show at the pre-Oscars weekend dinner was Jen.  Sources say she and Brad chose not to go to the restaurant together, to avoid any public scrutiny so soon after her official split from husband Justin Theroux – however it’s believed she caught up with Brad and George later.  ‘Jen lent George her bodyguard, knowing he and Brad would be coming back to her place in Bel Air after dinner,’ says a source.  ‘Given that George and Amal are mostly based in the UK now, he doesn’t have his own security detail in LA anymore – so Jen was only too happy to help.  ‘After the dinner, George and Brad went back to her place and they had a nightcap. Like old times.  ‘Brad raved about what a great mum Jen has been to his kids – that made him fall in love with her even more. And because George is a new dad he could really appreciate it.  ‘Brad said the kids have taken to Jen and they get really upset when they have to leave. He’s really enjoyed watching them bond.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",1
"CLOSE They took their Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan fandom to a whole new level. USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.  ""It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),"" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night.  MORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan  The special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding's life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim.  But Harding's mother isn't fan.  “I don’t give a (expletive) about the movie,"" said LaVona ""Sandy"" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. ""I don’t care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.”  MORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking  Janney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother.  Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to ""spank"" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument.  “Take a lie detector (expletive),"" Harding said in response to her mother's denials.  MORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic 'I, Tonya'  Kerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit.  ""I have two Olympics medals,"" Kerrigan said. ""They didn’t just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.”  Harding didn't deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women's figure skating.  ""Sure. Why not?"" Harding said. ""I mean, I was there. I skated.”  Harding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith).  ""Enough apologizing,"" Harding said. ""She has her life. I have my life. We both have wonderful lives. That should be all that matters.""  PHOTOS: Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan",1

"Maci Bookout was granted a two-year order of protection against ex-boyfriend Ryan Edwards after she claimed he threatened to hurt her and take their son.  The Teen Mom OG star was granted the order of protection against Edwards on Monday, according to E! News.  Edwards’ attorney Jonathan Turner told the outlet Edwards was not allowed to be within 100 feet of Bookout, her husband Taylor McKinney and their two children, Jayde 2, Maverick, 24 months. Bookout shares oldest son, Bentley, 9, with Edwards.  The order of protection will not affect his ability to see their son Bentley, Turner said as it will give him “a lot more protection against any false allegations, allows him to avoid getting arrested without a hearing first, and allows him to be around his son most importantly.”  Representatives for Edwards and Bookout did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.  The mother of three initially filed for an order of protection in March and listed her three children, Jayde, Maverick and Bentley in the protection order. McKinney also filed an order of protection against Edwards.  She shares Bentley with Edwards, while her youngest two she shares with husband Taylor McKinney.  Maci Bookout, Ryan Edwards John Phillips/Getty; MTV  Bookout also claimed in court documents obtained by E! News at the time that Edwards had “left voicemail messages threatening to show up at my house and take my son” and alleged he “has made threats to show up and hurt me if I don’t answer my phone.”  The MTV star also alleged that Edwards had appeared at Bentley’s baseball game in May 2017 “under the influence of heroin and got in my face, yelling and threatening to hurt me,” RadarOnline reported at the time.

"Brad Pitt, Neri Oxman Designing “Love Nest” Together?  10:26  Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman are not teaming up on a “romantic” architecture project, despite a bogus tabloid report. The article claims the actor and MIT professor are designing a “love nest” together, but a rep for Pitt tells Gossip Cop that’s completely false.  According to the National Enquirer, the actor is planning to build a “one-of-a-kind architectural masterpiece” with Oxman, who teaches art, architecture and design at the prestigious MIT Media Lab. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Brad’s not only inspired, he’s entranced with the brilliant brunette beauty.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Pitt and Oxman have “been secretly scouting location sites, looking for a perfect spot to make their artistic vision a groundbreaking reality.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster adds, “He’s nuts about Neri. He wants to build a palace with her… Their ‘special project’ is Brad’s dream come true.”  As Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, the movie star and professor aren’t dating. Pitt’s own spokesperson has told us this on the record several times, and trusted entertainment publications have backed it up. E! News recently reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends,” while People similarly stated that Pitt and Oxman’s friendship “is not romantic in nature.”  Even if the two were to team up on an architecture project, it certainly wouldn’t be a “love nest.” Of course, this outlet’s narrative is coming from an anonymous and almost assuredly made-up “source.” Meanwhile, Pitt’s rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that there’s “no truth” to the tabloid’s tale and that he’s not designing any type of structure with her at all.  It’s true that the pair met last year through a project at MIT, but they have no plans to construct a building together. Nor have they been “secretly scouting” locations. It’s telling that the unreliable magazine provides zero details about the areas where they’re supposedly exploring.  Unfortunately, the National Enquirer has been pushing a nonexistent romance between Pitt and Oxman ever since the news broke last month that he had visited her MIT class in November 2017. For example, Gossip Cop recently busted the publication for falsely claiming Angelina Jolie was “furious” about Pitt and Oxman’s relationship, and that she might even use it against him in their custody negotiations. And one month before the tabloid discovered the MIT professor existed, the outlet had wrongly reported Pitt had reunited with Jennifer Aniston. The untrustworthy magazine, which seems to change its narrative whenever it’s convenient, clearly has no real insight into the actor’s personal life.  National Enquirer Magazine Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman are designing a love nest together. Wednesday, May 2, 2018",0

I do have someone who is very, very good at twerking, and she helped me,” she says. “I never realized how flexible you have to be to do that stuff.”  “My teacher was like, ‘I really suggest you take yoga,’ and I didn’t know you had to take yoga to be a twerker, but apparently you do.”  From Coinage: This Is How Long You’ll Have To Work To Make As Much Money As Rihanna’s Hit ‘Work’  And as Azalea has said before — the butt you see is all-natural.

"2008 murder in Mesa, Arizona  On June 4, 2008, salesman Travis Victor Alexander (July 28, 1977 – June 4, 2008) was murdered by his ex-girlfriend, Jodi Ann Arias (born July 9, 1980), in his house in Mesa, Arizona, United States. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder on May 8, 2013, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on April 13, 2015, almost seven years after the murder.[n 1]  At the time of the killing, Alexander sustained multiple knife wounds and a gunshot to the head. Arias testified that she killed him in self-defense, but did not convince a jury.[2] The murder and trial received widespread media attention in the United States.[3][4][5][6][7]  Background [ edit ]  Travis Alexander was born on July 28, 1977,[8] in Riverside, California to Gary David Alexander (1948–1997) and Pamela Elizabeth Morgan Alexander (1953–2005). His early childhood was difficult largely because both of his parents were drug addicts.[citation needed] At the age of 11, Travis moved in with his paternal grandparents,[9] who introduced him to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[10] After his father's death in July 1997,[11] his seven siblings were also taken in by their paternal grandmother. Alexander was a salesman and motivational speaker for Pre-Paid Legal Services (PPL).[12][13]  Jodi Arias was born on July 9, 1980, in Salinas, California[14] to William and Sandra (née Allen) Arias.[15] She and Alexander met in September 2006 at a PPL conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Arias converted to Alexander's Mormon faith and, on November 26, 2006, was baptized into the LDS Church in a ceremony in southern California.[16] Alexander and Arias began dating in February 2007.[8][16] Arias moved to Mesa to live closer to Alexander.[17] In March 2007, she moved to Yreka, California, and lived there with her grandparents.[4]  Alexander and Arias dated intermittently for a year and a half, often in a long-distance relationship taking turns traveling between their respective Arizona and California homes.[18] Alexander's friends who knew Arias and observed them together tended to have a negative opinion of her, stating that the relationship was unusually tumultuous and her behavior worrying.[18]  Murder [ edit ]  Alexander was killed on June 4, 2008.[19] He sustained 27 to 29 stab wounds, his throat had been slit, and he had suffered a gunshot wound to the head.[20][21] Medical Examiner Kevin Horn testified that Alexander's jugular vein, common carotid artery, and trachea had been slashed and that Alexander had defensive wounds on his hands. Horn further testified that Alexander ""may have"" been dead at the time the gunshot was inflicted, and that the back wounds were shallow.[22][23][24] Alexander's death was ruled a homicide. He was buried at the Olivewood Cemetery in Riverside, California.[25]  Discovery and investigation [ edit ]  In early 2008, Alexander told people that Arias would join him for a work-related trip to Cancún, Mexico, scheduled for June 15.[26][27] In April, Alexander asked to change his travel companion to another female friend.[28] On May 28, 2008, a burglary occurred at the residence of Arias's grandparents, with whom Arias was living. Among the missing objects was a .25-caliber automatic Colt pistol (ACP), which was never recovered.[29] This later became significant as a shell casing from a spent .25 caliber round was found near Alexander's body at the murder scene.[30]  On June 2, between 1:00 am and 3:00 am, Arias called Alexander four times but did not appear to get through to him, since the longest of the calls was seventeen seconds. After 3:00 am, Alexander called Arias twice, the first time for eighteen minutes, the second time for 41 minutes. At 4:03 am, Arias called Alexander back and the call lasted two minutes, 48 seconds.[31] Neither these calls, nor transcripts of them, were presented in the Jodi Arias trial. At 5:39 am, Arias set out to drive south to rent a car for a long trip to Utah, as stated in evidence by a gasoline purchase at Shell Food Mart in Yreka, California. On June 2, at 8:04 am, Arias rented a car at Budget Rent a Car in Redding.[31] She indicated she would return the car to Budget in Redding. Arias visited friends in southern California on her way to Utah for a PPL work conference and to meet with Ryan Burns, a PPL co-worker. By late evening on June 3, 2008, Arias apparently set out for Salt Lake City.  Alexander missed an important conference call on the evening of June 4. The following day, Arias met up with Burns in the Salt Lake City neighborhood of West Jordan, Utah and attended business meetings for the conference. Burns later said he noticed Arias's formerly blonde hair was now dark brown, and she had cuts on her hands.[31] On June 6, Arias left Salt Lake City and drove west towards California. She called Alexander several times and left several voicemail messages for him. She also accessed Alexander's cell phone voice mail system.[32] When Arias returned the car on June 7, it had been driven about 2,800 miles (4,500 km). The rental clerk testified that the car was missing its floor mats and had red stains on its front and rear seats.[31] It could not be verified that the car had floor mats when Arias picked it up and any stains could not be verified since the car was cleaned before police could examine it.  On June 9, having been unable to reach Alexander, a concerned group of friends went to his home. His roommates had not seen him for several days, but believed he was out of town and thus did not think anything was amiss. After finding a key to Alexander's master bedroom, his friends entered and found large pools of blood in the hallway to the master bathroom, where his body was discovered in the shower.[26] In the 9-1-1 call (not heard by the jury), the dispatcher asked if Alexander had been suicidal or if anyone was angry enough to hurt him. Alexander's friends specifically mentioned Arias as a possible suspect, stating that Alexander had said she was stalking him, accessing his Facebook account, and slashing his car's tires.[33][34][35] While searching Alexander's home, police found his recently purchased digital camera damaged in the washing machine. Police were able to recover deleted images showing Arias and Alexander in sexually suggestive poses, taken at approximately 1:40 pm on June 4. The final photograph of Alexander alive, showing him in the shower, was taken at 5:29 pm that day. Photos taken moments later show an individual believed to be Alexander ""profusely bleeding"" on the bathroom floor.[36][37] A bloody palm print was discovered along the wall in the bathroom hallway; it contained DNA from both Arias and Alexander.[36][38]  On July 9, 2008, Arias was indicted by a grand jury in Maricopa County, Arizona for the first-degree murder of Alexander.[39][40] She was arrested at her home on July 15[41] and extradited to Arizona on September 5. Arias pled not guilty on September 11.[42] During this time, she gave several different accounts about her involvement in Alexander's death.[43] She originally told police that she had not been in Mesa on the day of the murder and had last seen Alexander in March 2007.[36][38] Arias later told police that two intruders had broken into Alexander's home, murdering him and attacking her. Two years after her arrest, Arias told police that she killed Alexander in self-defense, claiming that she had been a victim of domestic violence.[20][21][44][45][46]  On April 6, 2009, a motion to reconsider the defendant's motion to disqualify the Maricopa County District Attorney's Office was denied.[47] On May 18, the court ordered Arias to submit to IQ and competency testing.[48] Later, in January 2011, a defense filing detailed the efforts to which Arias's attorneys went to obtain text messages and emails. The prosecution initially told the defense attorneys that there were no available text messages sent or received by Alexander, and then was ordered to turn over several hundred such messages. Mesa police detective Esteban Flores told defense attorneys that there was nothing ""out of the ordinary"" among Alexander's emails; about 8,000 were turned over to the defense in June 2009.[49]  Trial [ edit ]  Court Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of Maricopa Decided May 7, 2013 ( ) Verdict Guilty on one count of first-degree premeditated murder Case history Subsequent action(s) Jodi Arias sentenced to life in prison without parole Case opinions 7 jury members: Guilty of first-degree premeditated murder and felony murder  5 jury members: Guilty of first-degree premeditated murder Court membership Judge(s) sitting Sherry K. Stephens  Jury selection [ edit ]  The trial commenced in Maricopa County's Superior Court before Judge Sherry K. Stephens on December 10, 2011. Initial jury selection began on December 10, 2012.[50] During jury selection on December 20, Arias's defense attorneys argued that the prosecution was ""systematically excluding"" women and African-Americans; prosecutor Juan Martinez said that race and sex were irrelevant to his decisions to strike certain jurors. Judge Stephens ruled that the prosecution had shown no bias in the jury selection.[51]  Guilt phase [ edit ]  In opening arguments on January 2, 2013, Martinez sought the death penalty.[52] Arias was represented by appointed counsel L. Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott, who argued that Alexander's death was a justifiable homicide committed in self-defense.[53]  Burns testified that when Arias visited him in Utah, the two had spent several hours hugging and kissing on a large bean bag chair. She told him she had cut her hands on broken glass while working at a restaurant called Margaritaville. A detective testified no restaurant by that name had ever existed in the Yreka area; at the time, Arias was working at a restaurant called Casa Ramos.[54] Later, Arias testified that after she cut her finger: ""I had a bazillion margaritas to make.""[55] Later, the prosecution argued that since a .25 caliber round was found near Alexander's body and that a gun of the same caliber was stolen from Arias's residence in Yreka the week before, she had staged the burglary and used the gun to kill Alexander.[29][30] Martinez claimed Arias had stalked Alexander and had slashed his tires twice. In addition, in the final days before his death, Alexander had called her a ""sociopath"" and ""the worst thing that ever happened to me"", and stated he was afraid of her.[56]  Arias took the stand in her own defense on February 4, 2013,[57] testifying for a total of eighteen days; the sheer length of time Arias spent on the stand was described by criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos as ""unprecedented"".[58] On the first day of her testimony, Arias told of being violently abused by her parents beginning when she was approximately seven years old.[57] She testified that she rented a car in Redding because Budget's website gave her two options, one to the north and one to the south, and her brother lived in Redding.[59] On her second day on the stand, Arias said that their sex life included oral and anal sex; she said the anal sex was painful for her the first time they experienced it together, and that while she considered these forms of sex to be real sex, Alexander did not as they were technically not against Mormon rules concerning regular sexual intercourse. Arias said that they eventually had intercourse, but less often.[60] A phone sex tape was played in which Alexander said he wanted to zip tie her to a tree and have anal sex with her while she was dressed as Little Red Riding Hood, which Arias seemed to respond to enthusiastically.[61] Arias had recorded this phone sex session without Alexander's knowledge or consent, apparently hoping to use it to embarrass Alexander to his Mormon peers.[18] Arias also testified that Alexander had secretly found young boys and girls sexually attractive and that she tried to help him with these urges.[62][63] Forensic experts testified that an examination of Alexander's computer found no evidence of pornographic material.[18]  Arias testified that her relationship with Alexander became increasingly physically and emotionally abusive.[64] Arias said that Alexander shook her while saying, ""I'm f***ing sick of you"", then began ""screaming at me"", after which he ""body slammed me on the floor at the foot of his bed"" and taunted her, saying ""don't act like that hurts"", before he called her a ""bitch"" and kicked her in the ribs. Afterward, Arias said ""he went to kick me again, and I put my hand out."" Arias held up her left hand in the courtroom, showing that her ring finger was crooked.[65] According to Arias, the dysfunction of their relationship reached its climax when she killed him in self-defense after he became enraged when she dropped his camera,[66] forcing her to fight for her life. This was the third differing account of Alexander's death given by Arias,[67] which both prosecutors, courtroom observers, and later jurors felt severely damaged her credibility. Rebuttal witnesses from the prosecution included several of Alexander's other girlfriends, who stated he never exhibited any problems with anger or violence.[18]  Arias addressed comments she made in a September 2008 interview with the syndicated news program Inside Edition, which had been played earlier in the trial. In the interview, she had said: ""No jury is going to convict me ... because I am innocent. You can mark my words on that."" Discussing the statement during her testimony, Arias said, ""At the time [of the interview], I had plans to commit suicide. So I was extremely confident that no jury would convict me, because I didn't expect any of you to be here."" At the close of his cross-examination of Arias, Martinez replayed the video and prompted Arias to affirm that she had said during the interview that she would not be convicted because she was innocent.[57][68][69] When being questioned by Martinez, Arias was initially combative and flippant, but after several days, Martinez was able to highlight the numerous lies and inconsistencies in her testimony and she admitted to stabbing and shooting Alexander despite her earlier claims of a lapse in her memory.[18] At the end of the guilt phase, the jury's foreman, William Zervakos, expressed an opinion common to both jurors and observers when he told ABC's Good Morning America that Arias's testimony did not do her any good. ""I think eighteen days hurt her. I think she was not a good witness,"" he said.[70]  Starting March 14, psychologist Richard Samuels testified for the defense for nearly six days. He said Arias was likely suffering from acute stress at the time of the killing, sending her body into a ""fight or flight"" mode to defend herself, which caused her brain to stop retaining memory. In response to a juror's question asking whether this scenario could occur even if this was a premeditated murder, as the prosecution contended, he responded: ""Is it possible? Yes. Is it probable? No."" Samuels also diagnosed Arias with post traumatic stress disorder.[71] Martinez attacked Samuels' credibility, accusing him of forming a relationship with Arias and being biased; Samuels had previously testified he had compassion for Arias.[72] Beginning on March 26, Alyce LaViolette, a psychotherapist who specializes in domestic violence, testified that Arias was a victim of domestic abuse, and that most victims do not tell anyone about abuse because they feel ashamed and humiliated.[73] LaViolette summarised emails from Alexander's close friends: ""They have basically advised Ms. Arias to move on from the relationship ... that Mr. Alexander has been abusive to women.""[74] The jury posed nearly 160 questions to LaViolette, many of them focusing on Arias's credibility.[75]  Clinical psychologist Janeen DeMarte testified for the prosecution, stating that she found no evidence Alexander had abused Arias, and no evidence of PTSD or amnesia in Arias. Furthermore, Arias's claimed total memory loss for long stretches of time was inconsistent with traumatic amnesia associated with PTSD which manifests as much shorter gaps in memory.[18] Instead, DeMarte said Arias suffered from borderline personality disorder, showing signs of immaturity and an ""unstable sense of identity."" People who suffer from such a disorder ""have a terrified feeling of being abandoned by others"", DeMarte told jurors.[76] The final defense witness was psychologist Dr. Robert Geffner, who said that DeMarte's borderline diagnosis was ""not appropriate"" and that all tests taken by Arias since her arrest pointed toward an anxiety disorder stemming from trauma. He also said the tests indicated that she answered questions honestly, without lying.[77][78] Following Geffner's testimony, the state recalled Dr. Horn, who testified further on the gunshot wound, and called Dr. Jill Hayes, a forensic neuro-psychologist, who disputed Geffner's testimony that the MMPI test was not geared toward diagnosing borderline personality disorder,[79] concluding a long day in court at 8:29 pm.[48]  On April 24, in response to previous testimony given by Arias about buying a five-gallon gas can from a Walmart store in Salinas on June 3, 2008, that she returned on the same day,[55] the prosecution called Amanda Webb, an employee from the only Walmart in Salinas, to the stand. Webb said that according to Walmart's records, no one returned a five-gallon gas can on that date, and that Arias returned the gas can a week later rather than on June 3.[80] The gas can evidence was seen as important in establishing premeditation, as the prosecutor argued that Arias was trying to avoid being recorded on gas station security cameras as she drove to Mesa.[18]  In closing arguments on May 4, Arias's defense argued that the premeditation theory did not make sense. ""What happened in that moment in time? The relationship, the relationship of chaos, that ended in chaos as well. There is nothing about what happened on June 4th in that bathroom that looks planned ... Couldn't it also be that after everything they went through in that relationship, that she simply snapped? ... Ultimately, if Miss Arias is guilty of any crime at all, it is the crime of manslaughter and nothing more.""[81] In rebuttal, Martinez described the extent and variety of Alexander's wounds. ""There is no evidence that he ever laid a hand on her, ever. Nothing indicates that this is anything less than a slaughter. There was no way to appease this woman who just wouldn't leave him alone,"" he said.[81]  Arias's testimony added to a very long defense portion of the guilt phase of the trial, which led to problems with retention of jury members. On April 3, a member of the jury was dismissed for ""misconduct"".[7] The defense team asked for a mistrial, which the judge denied.[7] On April 12, another juror was excused for health reasons.[82] A third juror was dismissed on April 25 after being arrested for a DUI offense.[83] As of April 25, 2012, defense costs had reached almost $1.7 million, paid by taxpayers.[84][85]  On May 7, 2013, after 15 hours of deliberation, Arias was found guilty of first-degree murder. Out of twelve jurors, five jurors found her guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, and seven jurors found her guilty of both first-degree premeditated murder and felony murder.[86] As the guilty verdict was read, Alexander's family smiled and hugged each other. People outside the courtroom began cheering and chanting.[87]  Aggravation phase [ edit ]  Following the first-degree murder conviction, the prosecution was required to convince the jury that the murder was ""cruel, heinous, or depraved"" in order for them to determine that Arias was eligible for the death penalty.[88] The aggravation phase of the trial started on May 15, 2013.[89][90] The only witness was the medical examiner who performed the autopsy. Arias's attorneys, who had repeatedly asked to step down from the case, gave only brief opening statements and closing arguments, in which they said the adrenaline rushing through Alexander's body may have prevented him from feeling much pain during his death. Prosecutor Martinez showed photos of the corpse and crime scene to the jury, then paused for two minutes of silence to illustrate how long he said it took for Alexander to die at Arias's hands. After less than three hours of consideration, the jury determined that Arias was eligible for the death penalty.[91]  Penalty phase [ edit ]  The penalty phase began on May 16, 2013, when prosecutors called Alexander's family members to offer victim impact statements, in an effort to convince the jury that Arias's crime merited a death sentence.[91]  On May 21, 2013, Arias offered an allocution, during which she pleaded for a life sentence. Arias acknowledged that her plea for life was a reversal of remarks she made to a TV reporter shortly after her conviction, when she said she preferred the death penalty. ""Each time I said that, I meant it, but I lacked perspective,"" she said. ""Until very recently, I could not imagine standing before you and asking you to give me life."" She said she changed her mind to avoid bringing more pain to members of her family, who were in the courtroom. At one point, she held up a white T-shirt with the word ""survivor"" written across it, telling the jurors that she would sell the clothing and donate all proceeds to victims of domestic abuse. She also said she would donate her hair to Locks of Love while in prison, and had already done so three times while in jail.[92]  That evening, in a joint jailhouse interview with The Arizona Republic, 12 News and NBC's Today show, Arias said she did not know whether the jury would come back with life or death. ""Whatever they come back with I will have to deal with it, I have no other choice."" Regarding the verdict she said, ""It felt like a huge sense of unreality, I felt betrayed, actually, by the jury. I was hoping they would see things for what they are. I felt really awful for my family and what they were thinking.""[93][94]  On May 23, 2013, the sentencing phase of Arias's trial resulted in a hung jury, prompting the judge to declare a mistrial for that phase. The jury had reached an 8–4 decision in favor of the death penalty.[95]  After the mistrial was declared and the jury discharged, the jury foreman stated that he believed Arias was mentally abused, but that had not been enough to excuse her crime. He also said, ""I think 18 days hurt her, I think she was not a good witness. We're charged with presuming innocence, right? But she was on the stand for so long, there were so many contradicting stories."" He said the jury found the responsibility of weighing the death sentence overwhelming, but were horrified when their efforts ended in a mistrial. ""By the end of it, we were mentally and emotionally exhausted,"" he said. ""I think we were horrified when we found out that they had actually called a mistrial, and we felt like we had failed.""[96]  On May 30, 2013, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery discussed the next steps at a news conference. He said he was confident an impartial jury could be seated, but it was possible that lawyers and the victim's family could agree to scrap the trial in favor of a life sentence with no parole.[97] Arias had said, ""I don't think there is an untainted jury pool anywhere in the world right now. That's what it feels like. But I still believe in the system to a degree, so we'll just go through that if that happens.""[93] Defense attorneys responded, ""If the diagnosis made by the State's psychologist is correct, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office is seeking to impose the death penalty upon a mentally ill woman who has no prior criminal history. It is not incumbent upon Ms. Arias's defense counsel to resolve this case.""[98][99]  Appeals [ edit ]  During the trial, defense attorneys filed for mistrial in January, April and May 2012.[100][101]  Arias's lawyers argued in January that Detective Esteban Flores, the lead Mesa police detective on the case, perjured himself during a 2008 pretrial hearing aimed at determining whether the death penalty should be considered an option for jurors. Flores testified at the 2009 hearing that based on his own review of the scene, and a discussion with the medical examiner, it was apparent that Alexander had been shot in the forehead first. Contrary to Flores' testimony at the 2009 hearing, the medical examiner told jurors the gunshot probably would have incapacitated Alexander; given his extensive defense wounds, including stab marks and slashes to his hands, arms and legs, it was not likely the shot came first. Flores denied perjury and said during his trial testimony that he just misunderstood what the medical examiner told him.[102]  In April, the defense claimed the prosecutor had acted inappropriately and said the case resembled a modern-day equivalent to the Salem witch trials. In the motion the defense team contended ""the prosecutorial misconduct has infested these proceedings with a level of unfairness that cannot be cured by any other means."" The motion also stated there is a ""circus-like atmosphere inside the courtroom"" and prosecutor Juan Martinez had yelled at witnesses, attacked witnesses on a personal level, and had thrown evidence. The motion also alleged that Martinez chose to release evidence and to pose for pictures with his fans on the steps of the courthouse. The attorneys claimed Arias was in a position where she could not present a complete defense, and the only constitutional course was to declare a mistrial.[101]  On May 20, 2012, defense attorneys again filed for mistrial. The motion alleged that a defense witness who had been due to testify the preceding Friday, the 17th, began receiving threats, including threats on her life if she were to testify on Arias's behalf. The day before the filing, the witness contacted counsel for Arias, stating that she was no longer willing to testify due to these threats. The motion continued, ""It should also be noted that these threats follow those made to Alyce LaViolette, a record of which was made ex-parte and under seal."" The motion was denied, as was a motion for a stay in the proceedings that had been sought to give time to appeal the decisions to the Arizona Supreme Court.[103]  On May 29, 2013, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal filed three months earlier, also refused by the mid-level Arizona Court of Appeals. Nurmi had asked the high court to throw out the aggravating factor of cruelty because the judge had allowed it to go forward based on a different theory of how the murder occurred. The lead detective originally claimed that the gunshot occurred first, followed by the stabbing and slitting of the throat; based on that theory, Stephens ruled there was probable cause to find the crime had been committed in an especially cruel manner, an aggravating factor under state law. Subsequent to this initial hearing, the medical examiner testified that the gunshot occurred postmortem.[102][104]  On July 6, 2018, Arias’ current attorneys, Margaret M. Green (a.k.a. Peg Green) and Corey Engle, filed a 324-page appeal seeking her murder conviction be overturned to the Arizona Court of Appeals. The state's response is due by January 4, 2019 and is to be provided by the Arizona Attorney General's Office. Following the state's response Arias will be allowed a formal reply to the state's counterargument prior to the case going before a three-judge panel for oral argument.[105][106]  Sentencing retrial [ edit ]  On October 21, 2014, Arias's sentencing retrial began. Opening statements were given, and a hearing on evidence was held. Prosecution witness Amanda Webb, called in the first trial to rebut Arias's testimony that she returned a gas can to Walmart on May 8, 2007, admitted she did not know if all records were transferred after the store relocated.[107] After a holiday break, the retrial resumed in January, 2015.[108] Mesa police experts admitted that Alexander's laptop had viruses and pornography, contrary to testimony in the first trial in 2013.[109] Jury deliberations began on February 12, 2015.[110][111] On March 2, 2015, the jury informed Judge Stephens that they were deadlocked. Arias's attorneys requested a mistrial. Stephens denied the request, read additional instructions to the jury, and ordered them to resume deliberations.[112] On March 5, 2015, Stephens declared a mistrial because the jurors, who deliberated for about 26 hours over five days, deadlocked at 11–1 vote in favor of the death penalty. Sentencing was scheduled for April 7, 2015, with Stephens having the option to sentence Arias to either life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or with the possibility of parole after 25 years.[113][114][115] On April 13, Stephens sentenced Arias to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[116] Until March 5, 2015, Arias's trials cost an estimated $3 million.[117]  In an interview on April 8, 2015, Arias's attorney Jennifer Willmott discussed the social media furor, death threats she received, Arias's statements at the sentencing, the holdout juror, and stated that she believed that Arias testified truthfully.[118]  In June 2015, following a restitution hearing, Arias was ordered to pay more than $32,000 to Alexander's siblings. Arias's attorney stated this was about 1/3 of the amount requested.[119]  Incarceration [ edit ]  As of 2016 , Arias is housed at the Arizona Department of Corrections #281129, which is located at Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville.[120] She started her sentence in the complex's maximum security Lumley Unit, but she has the possibility of being downgraded to the medium security level.[121]  Media [ edit ]  The Associated Press reported that, as of 3 November 2014, ""the public should be able to watch testimony in the Jodi Arias trial"".[122] This decision by a three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals overruled Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens' decision to ""allow a witness to testify in private as jurors [weighed] whether to give [Arias] the death penalty"".[122] The case, which has been at times broadcast around the world, has since the conclusion of the first trial been marked by secrecy, as Judge Stephens held secret (non-public) hearings. As a result of the move for ""secrecy,"" an unidentified defense witness was allowed to testify in private. Though Judge Stephens' decision has been overruled, ""the mystery witness who testified…at the start of the defense case"" (Associated Press) hasn't been revealed to the public.[122]  The case featured on an episode of 48 Hours Mystery: Picture Perfect in 2008,[8] an interview which, for the first time in the history of 48 Hours, was used as evidence in a death penalty trial.[123] On September 24, 2008, Inside Edition interviewed Arias at the Maricopa County Jail where she stated, ""No jury is going to convict me...because I am innocent and you can mark my words on that. No jury is going to convict me.""[41]  The Associated Press said the case was a ""circus"",[124] a ""runaway train""[124] and said the case ""grew into a worldwide sensation as thousands followed the trial via a live, unedited Web feed"".[125] They added that the trial garnered ""daily coverage from cable news networks and spawned a virtual cottage industry for talk shows"" and, at the courthouse, ""the entire case devolved into a circus-like spectacle attracting dozens of enthusiasts each day to the courthouse as they lined up for a chance to score just a few open public seats in the gallery""; ""For its fans, the Arias trial became a live daytime soap opera.""[125] The Toronto Star stated, ""With its mix of jealousy, religion, murder, and sex, the Jodi Arias case shows what happens when the justice system becomes entertainment.""[126]  During the trial, public figures freely expressed their opinions. ""Jodi Arias has stated that she follows me on Twitter so I really hate to be saying that she is guilty but sadly, she is as guilty as it gets"", Donald Trump wrote. He also offered Arias legal advice on how she could avoid the maximum sentence. ""Jodi should try but the govt. should not make a deal – no jury could be dumb enough to let her off (but you never know, look at OJ & others),"" Trump suggested.[127] Arizona Governor Jan Brewer told reporters after an unrelated press event that she believed Arias to be guilty. She sidestepped a question about whether she believed Arias was guilty of manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder, but said ""I don't have all the information, but I think she's guilty.""[128]  HLN staff and their commentators compared the case to the Casey Anthony case for the perceived similarities between Anthony and Arias and the emotions that the cases incited in the general public.[5][6] Additionally, HLN aired a daily show covering the trial called HLN After Dark: The Jodi Arias Trial.[129] The cable network sent out a press release titled ""HLN No. 1 Among Ad-Supported Cable as Arias Pleads for Her Life"", bragging that they led in the ratings. The release stated: ""HLN continues to be the ratings leader and complete source for coverage of the Jodi Arias Trial. On May 21, HLN ranked No.1 among ad-supported cable networks from 1:56p to 2:15p (ET) as Arias took the stand to plead for her life in front of the jury that found her guilty of Alexander's murder. During that time period, HLN out-delivered the competition among both total viewers (2,540,000) and 25–54 demo viewers (691,000). HLN also ranked No.1 among ad-supported cable networks for the 2p hour delivering 2,227,000 total viewers and 620,000 25–54 viewers.""[130]  Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret, a made-for-television movie, stars Lost actress Tania Raymonde as Arias and Jesse Lee Soffer, of The Mob Doctor and Chicago P.D., as Alexander. Prosecutor Juan Martinez was played by Ugly Betty actor Tony Plana and David Zayas, of Dexter, portrays detective Esteban Flores.[131] Created for and distributed by the Lifetime Network, the film premiered June 22, 2013.[132]  Former detective for Siskiyou County, California, who arrested Arias at her grandparents' home after it appeared she was on the move, is coming forward. He discusses his involvement in the explosive investigation and trial in the three-part limited series, that aired mid-January 2018, on Investigation Discovery (ID) titled ""Jodi Arias: An American Murder Mystery.""[133] The special explores the death of Alexander and the subsequent legal circus as Arias was tried.  An episode of Murder Made Me Famous, which aired August 15, 2015, chronicled the case.[134]  Social media [ edit ]  In late January 2013, artwork drawn by Arias began selling on eBay. The seller was her brother; he claimed that the profits went towards covering the family's travel expenses to the trial and ""better food"" for Arias while she was in jail.[135]  On April 11, USA Today reported that during the testimony of defense witness Alyce LaViolette, public outrage was extreme concerning her assertions that Arias was a victim of domestic violence. Tweets and other social media posts attacked LaViolette's reputation. More than 500 negative reviews of LaViolette's yet-to-be-released book appeared on Amazon.com calling LaViolette a fraud and a disgrace. ""It's the electronic version of a lynch mob,"" said retired Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Fields.[136] Attorney Anne Bremner, who said she received death threats after she provided legal counsel in the Amanda Knox case, told The Huffington Post that the kind of online ridicule and threats LaViolette received could affect attorneys and witnesses in high-profile trials. ""It's something to take into account,"" Bremner said. ""If I had kids I would consider it even more so.""[137]  On May 9, The Republic commented: ""The Jodi Arias trial has been a social-media magnet. And when Arias was convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder, Twitter and Facebook exploded with reaction. Much of it was aimed at Arias, though plenty of people tweeted at the media coverage, such as the antics of HLN host Nancy Grace. During the trial, hardcore followers of the proceedings were accused of trying to use social media to intimidate witnesses, or otherwise influence the outcome. Whether it had any effect is questionable, but it's a notable development.""[138]  On May 24, Victoria Washington, who was one of Arias's attorneys until she had to resign in 2011 because of a conflict, said ""Arias's lead attorney, Nurmi, was pilloried in social media. At one point, an Internet denizen digitally superimposed his face onto a crime-scene photo of Alexander dead in the shower of his Mesa home. I know people were aggravated with him constantly filing for mistrial, but you have to make and preserve the record for federal review (on appeal). If you don't file for mistrial, the appeals courts will say you waived it.""[139]  On May 28, Radar Online reported the jury foreman had been receiving threats ever since the panel deadlocked on the sentencing phase, and now his son was claiming he's receiving death threats. ""Today I read hate mail my dad had gotten. Some person had sent him a threatening message complete with his email address, full name, and phone number (which at the very least means that this guy should retake Hate Mail 101). I also read some comments on an article online about my dad. Surreal. They say my dad was fooled by the defendant, that he was taken with her, that he hated the prosecutor,"" his son wrote on his public blog.[140]  The Twitter account in Arias's name is operated by Arias's friends on her behalf.[141] On June 22, from that account, Arias tweeted, ""Just don't know yet if I will plea or appeal.""[141]  On March 6, 2015, after the retrial of the penalty phase concluded, it was reported that juror #17, the sole holdout, received death threats and police were posted at her house. Dennis Elias, a jury consultant, said, ""The very fact that people are making death threats and trying to out her, it is not a proud day for any single one of those people and they should be ashamed.""[142]  See also [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ In the State of Arizona, a sentence of natural life requires that the defendant be incarcerated for the rest of their natural lifespan, with no possibility of parole or early release.",1
"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.",1

For the big day, the actress wore a white lace dress with a cape by Reem Acra and styled by Brad Goreski and Daniela Romero, while Cook went with a classic look in a tux. Cuoco later changed into a lace Tadashi Shoji jumpsuit with Louise et Cie shoes and threw her hair into a ponytail for the reception.  Jamie Greenberg  “Ok let’s party!!! #kcsquared 💋 💕,” Cuoco captioned a second snap of the newlyweds gearing up for the reception.  RELATED: How Kaley Cuoco Achieved Her ‘Effortless and Natural’ Wedding Day Look — All the Details!  Cuoco, 32, and Cook, 27, delivered their own wedding vows, which had the bride both laughing and wiping tears from her cheeks, as a guest showed in an Instagram video.  One guest shared the moment Cook and Cuoco were married by her sister Briana Cuoco.  “I love you both so much,” Briana said before joking about how she took an online course to officiate the wedding, making Cuoco kneel over laughing.  Once pronounced husband and wife, the crowd cheered as the couple leaned in for their first kiss as newlyweds.  Another special video features the pair preparing for their first dance at the reception.  Cuoco and Cook got engaged on her birthday in November 2017 after dating for nearly two years.  Just hours before sharing the proposal on social media, Cook teased Cuoco with a fake ring while shopping at Target.  “On my loves birthday I got her everything she has always wanted….now judging by her face maybe not, it’s the thought that counts right,” he shared.  Then, Cook — the son of software billionaire Scott Cook — treated her to a romantic candlelit dinner and popped the question for real for a stunning tear-drop diamond, documenting her tearful reaction on Instagram.  She celebrated her bachelorette party in June.  “He is my perfect match,” Cuoco gushed to PEOPLE in March, adding that she hoped to make their pets part of their wedding. “He lets me wake up in the morning and say, ‘I want to go and rescue rabbits.’ And he’s like, ‘All right, let’s get a coffee and let’s go.’ And that is him.

She went through such a tough time with her divorce from Ryan, but she never gave up on finding love again. She’s really a romantic!”",1
"The star of Riverdale was involved in a late-night car crash last week after a grueling 16-hour work day outside Vancouver, prompting the cast and crew of the hit CW show to demand better safety protections during production.  K.J. Apa, 20, who plays Archie in the Warner Bros.-produced Archie Comics adaptation, apparently fell asleep driving the 45-minute trip home after midnight. He was taken to a local hospital for observation and later discharged without serious injuries. His car, however, didn't fare as well. The passenger side was apparently destroyed after striking a light pole, and the vehicle was rendered inoperable.  The crash has ignited a firestorm of protest on the Riverdale set, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. The show routinely requires shoots that last until the early morning hours, and the cast and crew are not provided transportation to and from the set. Cole Sprouse, who co-stars as Archie's pal Jughead and is one of Apa's close friends, had apparently planned to be in the car as well that night but changed plans at the last minute. Sprouse, a leader of sorts of the actors on the show, has asked that the Greg Berlanti-produced series provide transportation to castmembers working late hours.  A call between representatives for the actors and Warner Bros. executives is being set for Friday to discuss the issue, according to three sources. (Warner Bros. Television declined to confirm any such meeting.)  SAG-AFTRA announced Thursday afternoon that the union would investigate the set in Vancouver following the dangerous crash. ""This is an extremely troubling situation and we are deeply concerned about the safety of performers on the Riverdale set,"" the statement read. ""We are sending a team to Vancouver to review the circumstances surrounding safety issues affecting performers on this production.""  WBTV's policy is that actors are responsible for their own transportation to and from set, particularly when production is shooting outside the U.S. The studio, which makes several shows in Vancouver, declined to comment, but a source notes that actors are told they can call a taxi or stay in a hotel near a set on the studio's dime if they feel it is unsafe to drive.  The crash is the latest in a string of safety-related incidents that highlight what many claim are unsafe working conditions on Hollywood productions. Stunt professionals and others in the industry have been clamoring for improvements to their working conditions, citing long working hours, stringent transportation requirements and early start times as contributors to an unsafe working environment. Apa was in the middle of a 45-minute commute back to his hotel after 16 hours of shooting when he fell asleep at the wheel, sources say.  Several safety-related issues have made headlines recently. In July, 33-year-old veteran stuntman John Bernecker fell 22 feet to his death on the set of The Walking Dead, falling off a balcony during a rehearsal. Less than a month later, professional motorcycle racer S.J. Harris was killed in a crash during filming for Deadpool 2, which was filming in Vancouver. Harris' death is still being investigated. Stunt professionals familiar with the details of the crash have said her death was a preventable tragedy, and that the movie's producers placed undue pressure on the stunt coordinators to use Harris.  Many Riverdale castmembers are friends as well as colleagues, which may have contributed to an increased sense of unease and anger among them around the crash this week and the response to it. ""They're working these kids from morning until night,"" says one person familiar with the production and the circumstances of the accident. ""Someone's going to die.""  According to a statement Thursday from Warner Bros., the studio refutes any claim that Apa worked a 16-hour work day and that it could have caused his accident.  ""First and foremost, we are extremely grateful that KJ Apa was uninjured during his recent accident. Secondarily, we want to specifically address the characterization that conditions on the set of Riverdale are of concern,"" a WBTV spokesperson said in a statement to THR. ""We have a large cast of series regulars, and our actors do not work every day. On the day of the accident, KJ worked 14.2 hours. The previous day he worked 2.5 hours, and the day before that he worked 7.7 hours. KJ has repeatedly been informed about making production aware if he is tired or feels unsafe, and if so, either a ride or hotel room will be provided for him. The accident occurred last Thursday. Additionally, it is untrue that KJ was taken to the hospital. He was treated by first responders on the scene and released by them. We also sent a doctor to his home later that same day for a follow-up to confirm his well-being.""  Riverdale became a breakout hit for The CW last season. The younger-skewing network renewed the Twin Peaks-style drama for a second season after airing only six of its first 13 episodes. The cast, too, became fan favorites, earning a Teen Choice nomination for Apa as ""breakout star"" as well as wins for Sprouse for drama actor and ""breakout"" TV show, among others.  Given its strong and vocal fan base, The CW will move Riverdale to a fall premiere and use it to help launch its remake of Dynasty. The network and studio see Riverdale as the start of a franchise, with news breaking Wednesday that The CW and WBTV are developing The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina as a potential companion series. And the key to that: Apa's Archie.  ""The safety of the cast and crew on all of our productions is of paramount importance to the Studio,"" WBTV said in a statement. ""Productions adhere to the Screen Actors Guild–mandated turnaround time of 12 hours from wrap time to next day call time for cast members. In accordance with industry standard policy, if any cast or crew member feels tired or unsafe at any time after working, the Studio will provide a taxi, a driver or a hotel room upon request. This is communicated to all cast and crew, both in writing and verbally, at the beginning of production and is reiterated continuously throughout the duration of production.""

"ABC/Jeff Daly(LOS ANGELES) -- Former Bachelor contestant Corinne Olympios has broken her silence about the incident that took place on the set of Bachelor in Paradise earlier this month.  On Wednesday afternoon, the reality TV star confirmed in a statement obtained by ABC News that she was a part of the incident, which prompted Warner Brothers, the studio behind the show, to suspend production and to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct.  Though she did not go into detail, Olympios explained that she is currently in therapy to ""begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma"" that she sustained while shooting the show in Mexico.  She also said that she has retained an attorney to ""obtain justice.""  “I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place,"" she said, adding, ""As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.""  A representative for Warner Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for ABC, the network on which the show airs, referred a request for comment to Warner Brothers, since the incident deals with production.  On Sunday afternoon, Warner Brothers released a statement confirming that production on season four of the show had been suspended and ""appropriate responsive action"" would be taken following a ""thorough investigation.""  Two days later, Chris Harrison, the host of the Bachelor franchise, urged fans to ""be patient"" and apologized for ""any inconvenience and disappointment"" caused by the show's suspension.  Last week, ABC released the names of several Bachelor in Paradise contestants. In addition to Olympios, they included Raven Gates, Alexis Waters, Jasmine Goode and DeMario Jackson.

"Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber: A Timeline of Their Relationship  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's on-again, off-again relationship is making headlines once again, after the pop stars were spotted together on a recent breakfast-and-church date.  Fans may be speculating whether or not the one-time couple's romance is rekindling, especially amid reports of Gomez and The Weeknd splitting up, or if they're just friends. It's hard say: Gomez and Bieber's storied relationship has gone from breaking up and making up and from ""I am so beyond done with talking about that"" to ""I'm never going to stop loving her.""  ""Sometimes love isn't a feeling but a choice,"" Bieber posted on Instagram in 2014. In an interview published a year later, he spoke candidly of his ex and circled back to that quote: ""Love is a choice. Love is not a feeling. People have made it seem in movies that it's this fairy tale. That's not what love is. You're not gonna want to love your girl sometimes but you're gonna choose to love her.""  Below, check out a play by play of the couple's relationship -- at least, the parts that have been seen through the public eye.  December 2010: It All Started With Pancakes  They first met in 2009. A year later, when Bieber was 16 and Gomez was 18, the two apparently shared a meal and some laughs -- and maybe took part in some hand-holding? -- at an IHOP in Philadelphia.  Gomez apparently exclaimed to US that ""it was just pancakes!"" but a week later, they were seen together again by Bieber's tour bus in Miami, where he had a concert. Those who were really paying attention noticed Bieber had his arm placed on Gomez's back.  Bieber brushed it off by calling Gomez ""an amazing person"" and telling MTV he was ""just having fun being a teenager.""  January 2011: Caught Kissing in the Caribbean  The young maybe-lovebirds still weren't saying a thing about their rumored relationship, but the pictures said plenty.  Gomez and Bieber were photographed on vacation together, kissing and embracing on a private yacht in St. Lucia.  February 2011: Holding Hands & Going Red Carpet Official  After being photographed together again, this time hand in hand in Santa Monica, Calif., the new teen idol couple made their first real appearance together at a Vanity Fair after-party for the 2011 Oscars in Hollywood.  Bieber looked sharp in a black suit, while Gomez turned heads in a stunning red gown -- but more importantly, they arrived arm in arm on the party's red carpet.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber arrives at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party at the Sunset Tower in Los Angeles on Feb. 27, 2011. AP Photo/Carlo Allegri  March 2011: Thanks to Ellen, Selena Will Never Spend a Night Alone  There was no denying she was dating Bieber by now, so Gomez was a good sport when Ellen DeGeneres teased the singer about their relationship. In fact, she even accepted a very special gift from the daytime talk show host: a pillow with her boyfriend's face.  ""He's gonna make me sleep with this every night,"" she admitted.  May 2011: Smooching at the Billboard Music Awards  At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Gomez and Bieber were seen sharing some PDA yet again, this time with a kiss. Things were still sweet a few months into their budding romance.  September 2011: A Romantic Date Alone ... At the Staples Center  In a grand gesture, Bieber planned a kind of night out with his girlfriend that's not easily replicated. The two had the entire Staples Center to themselves, where they apparently enjoyed a private viewing of Titanic.  “Romance isn’t dead,” Bieber tweeted after their romantic date. “Treat your lady right fellas.”  romance isnt dead. treat your lady right fellas. #REAL — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) September 24, 2011  February 2012: Diamonds for Valentine's Day  Around the time of Valentine's Day in 2012, Gomez showed off a new sparkly ring in a photo on Twitter. The ring appeared to be made up of diamonds shaped in the letter 'J,' and her hand was being held by (one can only guess) Bieber.  ""I'm finally home,"" she tweeted along with the picture.  April 2012: Selena's 'Humiliating' Kiss Cam Moment  The couple's outing to a Lakers game ended up majorly embarrassing Gomez, after their faces showed up on the kiss cam and they found themselves obligated to, you know, kiss.  “Oh God, that was probably the most humiliating thing that’s ever happened to me,” she told Ryan Seacrest. “We were watching and I thought it was funny, and they were showing little elderly couples and it was so cute. And all of a sudden we’re both looking up and we come on [the screen] and it’s like… it was so awkward. It was so weird. I mean you have to kiss, right?”  November 2012: Selena & Justin Break Up  The Associated Press confirmed Gomez and Bieber went their separate ways, with other outlets reporting that ""distance"" and ""busy schedules"" were the reason for the split heard 'round the pop world.  April 2013: A Snuggly Snapshot  Rumors swirled about the couple revisiting their romance, but some seemingly concrete evidence came when Bieber shared a shirtless Instagram photo in which he was being embraced by his ex.  ""'You've been makin music for too long babe come cuddle' -her,"" he captioned the picture.  May 2013: A GIFable Moment  After another awards show round, a brief backstage happening made its rounds around the internet.  Gomez and Bieber were spotted sharing a quick kiss. Meanwhile, Gomez's bestie Taylor Swift reacted to the scene by turning away and sticking her tongue out.  i hope taylor gives selena THAT LOOK after seeing her with justin again pic.twitter.com/6xLHVs3oPI — • (@Splasharesongs) October 29, 2017  January 2014: Some Quality Time Together  After a quiet period, the pair was spotted by TMZ casually riding Segways together in Calabasas. Bieber also shared a photo of the two on Instagram with the caption ""love the way you look at me.""  Early November 2014: The Power of 'The Heart Wants What It Wants'  Likely inspired by her relationship with Bieber, Gomez dropped a personal new song along with a music video.  Opening ""The Heart Wants What It Wants,"" a emotional voiceover from Gomez said, ""I know him though, and I know that I know his heart, and I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me. But I didn't realize that I'm feeling so confident and feeling so great about myself and then it [can] just be completely shattered by one thing. By something so stupid. But then you make me feel crazy, you make me feel like it's my fault. I was in pain.""  Meanwhile, Bieber posted a quote on Instagram that was interpreted to be his response: ""Sometimes love isn't a feeling but a choice."" He added, ""It's easy to love when you feel it, but love when it's hard to love.""  Mid-November 2014: Justin Unfollows Selena on Instagram  It was unclear what drama caused him to do this, but fans certainly took notice when Bieber stopped following Gomez on Instagram.  Some speculated that he wasn't thrilled by the cozy photo she'd posted with her ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" music video co-star. ""I think [Justin] was a little jealous of the video guy at first,"" the singer had previously told Ryan Seacrest.  June 2015: 'Where Are U Now,' Selena?  In the video for Bieber's ""Where Are U Now"" collaboration with Skrillex and Diplo, Selena's name clearly makes a cameo.  ""Justin wrote this record during a tough time in his life and it comes to us that sometimes, as artists, we are also just objects and we have to take that as much as we have to use that to create,"" Skrillex and Diplo said in a statement.  September 2015: Justin's 'What Do You Mean' Video References Selena  Bieber may have been reaching out to Selena in his ""What Do You Mean"" music video.  Some super observant fans noticed that her name was spray-painted on a wall of graffiti in the clip for the song, in which he sings lines like ""First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right/ Wanna argue all day, make love all night.""  Selena Gomez's name is spray painted on a wall in Justin Bieber's ""What Do You Mean"" music video. #Jelena pic.twitter.com/c3boNK8HMl — klaroline hooligan (@perhapsonedaykc) September 1, 2015  Early October 2015: Selena Says She's Found Closure  The singer opened up about her feelings toward her ex-boyfriend while doing press for her new album, Revival.  “We’re on good terms,"" Gomez said in a Billboard cover story, but clarified that she was ready to focus on herself and her career: This is my time. I’ve deserved this. I earned it. This is all me.”  “At this point, there is no anger,"" she said in an interview with Refinery29. ""There's closure in a very good, healthy way. We’ve seen each other. I'm always encouraging and I am proud of his journey.  She added: ""I think people are making it out to be something that is more tragic than it really was. We grew up together. We both made mistakes. That's it.""  Mid-October 2015: A Justin & Selena Duet?  One night on OVO Sound Radio, an unreleased song that had the former couple trading vocals came out of nowhere. The track had lyrics about wanting to work things out in a relationship, and Bieber singing the line “Gotta be strong, strong, strong” in the chorus.  It turned out the song was written two years prior and wasn't meant to be released, but it sure had fans wondering what was going on at the time.  May 2015: A Mini Reunion  The two reportedly attended the same church service one weekend, and they were spotted being goofy in a Snapchat video posted by a preacher.  August 2015: Selena Throws Some Shade on the 'Jelena' Obsession  The couple's relationship -- referred to as ""Jelena"" by many -- may have seen its downfall due to their young age and being overly exposed by the media, according to Gomez.  ""It's difficult for people to separate us. The internet wants to freeze this moment in time and constantly repeat it,"" she told the U.K.'s Sunday Times.  ""I didn't think I was doing anything bad by falling in love,"" the singer said. ""There's such an emphasis on people being the perfect thing and then destroying them because it's good press. Throw in the fact that you are a teenager -- it makes it more difficult.""  September 2015: What Justin Learned  While he didn't say her name, Bieber described his intense relationship with Gomez in an interview with Complex.  ""I moved in with my girlfriend when I was 18,"" he said. ""Started my own life with her. It was a marriage kind of thing. Living with a girl, it was just too much at that age. But we were so in love. Nothing else mattered. We were all about each other.  ""But when it’s like that and you get your value from that, people will always disappoint you,"" he went on. ""Your girl or your dude, they’re always going to disappoint you. Your full identity can’t be in that person. My identity was in her. Her identity was in me. When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin’ mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other. Love is a choice. Love is not a feeling. People have made it seem in movies that it’s this fairy tale. That’s not what love is. You’re not gonna want to love your girl sometimes but you’re gonna choose to love her. That’s something in life that I had to figure out.""  Early November 2015: 'A Love That Never Really Dies'  In a Billboard cover story, Bieber proclaimed, ""When you love someone that much, even if something comes between you, it’s a love that never really dies.""  In an interview with Access Hollywood around the same time period, he admitted that at least three of the tracks on his Purpose album were about Gomez. On an Ellen appearance, he revealed the titles of those songs -- ""Sorry,"" ""What Do You Mean"" and ""Mark My Words"" -- and mused that someday they ""could maybe come together and make an awesome duo"" once again.  ""It was really tough. I don't know if I'm over it yet,"" Bieber said of their breakup at the time.  ""[She] is someone I love dearly,"" he went on. ""I'm never going to stop loving her. I'm never going to stop checking in on her. I don’t think if you end a relationship, you should end that, unless it was super toxic and you guys were hurting each other physically or mentally. We always respected each other and we still respect each other.""  ""I don’t know what happens. I don't know what is going to happen in the future. I think we both gotta do some soul searching ourselves and figure out ourselves before we can just try to figure out each other,"" he added.  Late November 2015: Selena's Still His Sunshine on a Cloudy Day  Over a year after they were last seen out in public with one another, Bieber made a crystal clear statement when he serenaded his former flame with ""My Girl"" at a hotel bar. The pair reportedly left together, according to footage captured by TMZ.  December 2015: Justin Gets Nostalgic on Instagram  Bieber advised everyone to ""calm down"" when he posted some cute throwback photos from his dating days with Gomez, including one of the two of them on a red quadbike, and another of the couple holding hands a movie premiere.  Just a throwback calm down A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Dec 1, 2015 at 7:03pm PST  Crazy throwback A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Dec 5, 2015 at 11:25pm PST  January 2016: Selena Is So Over Talking About Her Ex  The ""Same Old Love"" singer got straight to the point when Rolling Stone asked her about Bieber.  ""Honestly, what I would love to be printed is that I am so beyond done with talking about that, and him,"" she responded. 'Nuff said.  February 2016: They're on Friendly Terms  ""We don't talk often, but we're cordial. If she needs something, I'm there for her. If I need something, she's there for me,"" Bieber said of his ex in an interview with GQ. During the same period, Gomez congratulated him on winning a Grammy for ""Where Are U Now"": “I’m very happy for him. Honestly, so cool,"" she said.  March 2016: Justin Lets Us in on All the 'Feels'  Throwing it back yet again, Bieber showed everyone he was still thinking about his romance with Gomez by posting an old photo of the former couple locking lips.  The intimate picture would go on to become the most-liked picture on Instagram at the time.  Feels A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Mar 19, 2016 at 4:07pm PDT  July 2016: Justin's Mom Wishes Selena a Happy Birthday  Bieber probably isn't singing about Gomez on ""Love Yourself,"" since his mama clearly does like her. On Gomez's birthday, Pattie Mallette (Bieber's mom) wished the singer a happy birthday, along with a very pleasant message: ""I am blessed to know you @selenagomez & celebrate this precious day you were born!""  I am blessed to know you @selenagomez & celebrate this precious day you were born! Don't let them get to you. Keep UR peace & joy #LoveWins — Pattie Mallette (@pattiemallette) July 22, 2016  August 2016: Justin Leaves Instagram  After threatening to make his Instagram private if his followers didn't ""stop the hate"" about rumored girlfriend Sofia Richie, he went a step further and deactivated it completely.  Gomez, however, apparently sided with his Beliebers. She reportedly commented, “If you can’t handle the hate, then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol- It should be special between you two only. Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you and supported you before any one ever did.”  January 2017: Justin's Not a Weeknd Fan  While word was getting out that Gomez had started dating The Weeknd, Bieber didn't have anything nice to say about it. When asked if he listens to the rapper's music, Bieber replied, ""Hell no I can’t listen to a Weeknd song. That shit's wack.""  October 2017: Back to Breakfast  Following reports that Gomez and The Weeknd broke up, she was seen meeting Bieber for breakfast and going to church with him. Of course, this got people wondering whether they're just friends who are reconnecting, or if their relationship will begin again.",0

"Vacation time is here let’s go girl A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv) on Jul 8, 2018 at 1:04pm PDT  Steve Harvey has effectively dispelled a rumor that bubbled up last week, claiming that he and wife Marjorie Harvey are headed for a $400 million divorce.  The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  “Vacation time is here, let’s go girl,” he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.  The photo, which was similar to one Marjorie posted on her Instagram Story, got praise from fans.  “God bless….. stay focus[ed] don’t [lose] the vision🙏💍.”  “Enjoy yourselves, you guys deserve this vacation. Come back well rested and a stronger bond and marriage. Yahoo for the Harveys.”  Days earlier, RadarOnline reported that Marjorie walked out on Steve because he had been getting close with Kris Jenner during closed-door business meetings and ongoing phone calls and text messages.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told the gossip site of the reported split. “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Although Jenner was reportedly just stringing Steve along to get tips on TV success, one of his former talk show employes said Marjorie knows her man, who is twice divorced and cheated on both wives with the next.  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” the ex-worker told Radar anonymously. “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  The rumor was the talk of Twitter.  “Am I late?? Did everyone know Steve Harvey is being accused of cheating on Marjorie with Kris Jenner?! I didn’t know this 😂.”  “Steve Harvey left his wife to marry Marjorie, his side b—- of 20 years, and now she’s leaving him and running his pockets. Hilarious. Karma’s a bad b—-.”  “Boyyy if this Steve Harvey rumor is true… he gon be sick for a minute. He loves him some Marjorie.”",0

"Matt Swider Sure, Cyber Monday 2018 is over, but plenty of US retailers have kept their price drops on electronics from the weekend - and are even introducing new deals. It's being dubbed 'Cyber Monday Week', which doesn't make too much sense, if we're honest. What does make a lot of sense? The deep discounts. We expect savings to continue on everything from 4KTVs, laptops, hard drives and phones to all other tech-related odds and ends. It may stay that way until Christmas, as stores attempt to sell off lots of their inventory. Of course, as Cyber Monday Week passes, deals will come and go. Finding the lowest price on a consoles bundle, especially Nintendo Switch and PS4, keeps getting harder. That $250 iPad deal has sold out and the small Walmart rollback price on Apple AirPods has expired. But there are still a bunch of other bargains to find. Our mission for the rest of Cyber Monday Week 2018 is to list the best deals that are still running. We won't be updating this page hourly like we did for Cyber Monday, but we'll still routinely curate this list and trim the deals that have expired.

Matt Swider The Cyber Monday dates change every year (since it's always a Monday, but it's always the Monday after Thanksgiving (the last Thursday of November) and the Monday after Black Friday. So despite the date changing, the routine is always the same. That means Cyber Monday 2018 is November 26, and the many (if not all) deals will expire as Tuesday rolls around. Usually this means Cyber Monday will end at midnight Pacific time (Amazon, for example, is based on the West coast of the US). In that time, we're going to see. We're going to see 4K TVs on sale from Samsung, LG, Sony, and especially TCL, with the Roku Fire TV combo impressing. Cameras will be on sale from Canon and Nikon, but the most popular camera deals will come from GoPro. Note the new GoPro Hero 7 Black hasn't had get a steep discount, but the older GoPro Hero 6 Black and GoPro Hero 5 Black will still see significant price drops. Top US retailers with the best Cyber Monday 2018 are expected to be Walmart , Amazon , Newegg , Best Buy, GameStop, and Jet.  4K TV deals will satill be big on Cyber Monday  Matt Swider When it comes to video game consoles, Nintendo Switch may get its second year of big deals (it was massively popular last year – and actually in stock), and PS4 and Xbox One will continue to be big sellers on Cyber Monday. Overall, the best value comes from games bundled with the system rather than reduced prices. The best noise-canceling headphones, wireless headphone, and Bluetooth speakers are gadgets that just about everyone on your holiday wish list will want in 2018. The same goes for even bigger ticket items: the best iPads, Chromebooks, and fitness trackers, and DSLRs.  What’s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday?  Matt Swider The Black Friday vs Cyber Monday debate is an important one. You don't want to buy something for Black Friday only to have it become cheaper on Cyber Monday. Or do you? Our best advice is to buy everything you need on Black Friday and keep a watch on additional price drops on Cyber Monday. If it's all cheaper on Cyber Monday, return your Black Friday item (or cancel it if that option is still available) and walk away with the cheapest price possible. But, in advance, Black Friday usually offers steep discounts in stores, while Cyber Monday is almost strictly an online sale. Retailers, like Walmart and Amazon are very keen to keep you shopping all weekend long, so they often slowly roll out deals (with 'rollback prices' in Walmart's case) to keep you browsing throughout the Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates.  Cyber Monday can help you save on the most expensive products, like gaming computers  The top deals of Cyber Monday last year  Matt Swider Listing the best Cyber Monday deals last year started off with cheap iPads. iPad Pro is wildly expensive for the average consumer. But on that special Monday date last year, you could get up to $120 off the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad. Sonos speakers and the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 were also big sellers thanks to price cuts. Yes, HomePod had just launched and MacBooks do remain very popular, but Sonos and Microsoft have offered better prices (and better value). That was true last year and may remain true in 2018.  Why is Cyber Monday called Cyber Monday?  Matt Swider The term was coined by Ellen Davis and Scott Silverman, and it was a deliberate move to promote online shopping back in 2005, when the internet was made of wood and powered by steam. It was intended to help smaller retailers compete with the big names who were banging on about Black Friday, although of course those big names promptly jumped on the Cyber Monday bandwagon too.  Are Cyber Monday deals real?  Matt Swider Oooh, the big question: generally speaking, yes they are – although in some cases the discounts have been negotiated well in advance with suppliers, so they’re not as spontaneous as the sellers might have you believe. As with any sales event, you’ll see a mixture of genuine bargains, discounted end-of-line stock and strange things found in the back of a warehouse somewhere. In 2016, consumer magazine 'Which?' accused retailers of some pretty dodgy behavior. If you avoid the slightly-shifty stuff, though, you can get some really great deals. For example, last year we got tons of money off 5K iMacs (end of line stock), Hi-Res audio players (deep discounting in the hope of selling headphones), wireless headphones (from another retailer hoping to sell Hi-Res audio players) and tons of Christmas presents. And, some TechRadar writers were physically restrained from spending all our savings on electric guitars, which were getting some serious discounting on high-end models.  How is TechRadar showing the best Cyber Monday deals?  Matt Swider A lot of research goes into finding the best Cyber Monday deals. For 2018, we've gone through over 10,000 deals from various US retailers: Walmart, Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Target. And with so many models of laptops, 4KTVs, and other electronics. We do this months in advance, predicting which Cyber Monday categories (like smart speakers) will take off, and then reporting on the results in the day after Cyber Monday.  Check out our tips to avoid scams on Black Friday  Fitbit Charge 3: $149.95 now $119.95  The Fitbit Charge 3 is one of the best fitness bands we've tested, despite the brand no longer being the tracking behemoth it once was.

"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.",0

"Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately — not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the “crazy and manipulative” estranged wife who has become increasingly “unpopular in Hollywood.” She’s “out for blood” in the divorce fight, or she “wants to embarrass and punish” the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed “an insane jealousy” jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency’s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children — girls especially — whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can’t read or write and has been “robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.”  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university — while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  “There are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,” Jolie wrote. “There are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.”  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: “Not with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.”  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  “Hardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,” Jolie wrote. “It is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.”  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a “patient, long-term manner, guided by our values.” She concluded her piece by writing: “If we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.”",0

"Avril Lavigne is alive.  On the 15th anniversary of the pop star’s hit single “Complicated,” a conspiracy theory claiming that she died in 2003 and has been replaced by a lookalike has resurfaced. If you aren’t familiar with the theory, this blogpost dating back to 2011 from a Brazilian site should bring you up to speed. The basic idea is that Lavigne, who was at the peak of her career at the time, committed suicide after her grandfather’s death in 2003. Rather than coming to terms with what had happened, Lavigne’s record company used Melissa Vandella – Lavigne’s doppleganger who was supposedly hired to pose as Lavigne for paparazzi – in her place to profit off of her celebrity.  As the story goes, Vandella then went to record “Under My Skin” as Lavigne (“From here it was no longer the real Avril,” the blog post reads, “but ‘Avril Lavigne’ under the skin of the other singer”) and left subtle hints along the way about what had really happened. That, along with pictures of how Lavigne’s face and handwriting had changed, was all the proof they needed.  There’s just one problem. As Buzzfeed explained in an article titled “Here’s How I Accidentally Made An Old Avril Lavigne Death Hoax Go Viral,” that Brazilian post made it clear at the beginning that it was created to show “how conspiracy theories can look true.” And yet, despite that disclaimer, the theory quickly spread like wildfire thanks to the Buzzfeed writer sharing the conspiracy theory as a joke with his fellow Americans following a visit to Buzzfeed Brazil.  Which brings us to today. Late last week, Twitter used @givenchyass brought the conspiracy theory back to life with a long thread explaining it all. It begins with this tweet, which has over 100,000 retweets and 160,000 favorites:  avril lavigne is dead & was replaced by a look alike: a conspiracy theory thread pic.twitter.com/9eearQ2rte — ? (@givenchyass) May 13, 2017  And quickly divulges into this:  here’s a video I made comparing an avril song from 2002 to an avril song from 2014 pic.twitter.com/1KFZJ8cHnD — ? (@givenchyass) May 13, 2017  This:  @givenchyass BIIIH SHE REALLY TRIED TO TELL US pic.twitter.com/YSgVMHP3sD — Kelly (@kellyblaus) May 14, 2017  This:  @givenchyass Okay so I was looking at these and the corners of their eyes are shaped differently and now I’m geeking pic.twitter.com/ag2G37NsSt — A (@ashlynnktigner) May 14, 2017  And this:  @givenchyass avrils old handwriting vs a latest tweet ???? pic.twitter.com/1cwBbgSBfy — the sweetest heart (@privatelaprip) May 14, 2017  Again, none of this is true – Lavigne is active on social media and revealed that she has an album coming later this year – but the details and photos from that blogpost continue to resurface and act as fodder for those who want to believe it. For that reason, this probably isn’t the last we’ve heard of this conspiracy theory.",0

"Selena Gomez had a strong support system during her recent kidney transplant, including boyfriend The Weeknd.  A source close to the 25-year-old tells PEOPLE that the R&B star — born Abel Tesfaye — did all he could to help his girlfriend recover after she underwent surgery following complications from the chronic autoimmune disease Lupus.  “Abel has been one of her biggest supports. She had been traveling with him on his tour and he was off during her surgery and right after during her recovery,” the insider says.  “He’s been very caring and it’s meant a lot to her to have him by her side.” The pair were seen out and about on Friday in New York City.

"They may have called it quits on their relationship but ex-couple Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin are still emotional about each other. Despite making it clear that she is not keen on getting back with her ex, the Teen Mom star couldn't help but break down on the latest episode of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars.  The challenging episode involved a fake drill, whereby Marroquin was placed on a so-called ""death bed"" pretending to have met with a fatal accident while Lowry reads a letter from him. But it was only a matter of time before the 25-year-old reality star got all teary-eyed.  ""This is f****d up,"" Lowry said before walking out of the apparent hospital room, only to be forced back in moments later. In an unexpected turn of events, the mother-of-three seemed to be completely emotional, fighting back tears throughout the exercise.  ""I care about you so much and I never knocked you as a father,"" Lowry said to the father of her child. ""I'll make sure that our son is taken care of.""  ""It was nice to get some emotion out of her,"" Marroquin later opens up in a confessional adding, ""You never tell me how you feel ... If you were to die, a part of me would die. You will always have a piece of my heart.""  Lowry and Marroquin, who share three-year-old son Lincoln, have been open about their struggles as a former couple and joined the Marriage Boot Camp to work on their co-parenting skills. However, it's been more of a bumpy road with the MTV star squashing much of Marroquin's approaches.  Regardless of their differences, though, 24-year-old Marroquin appeared hopeful during Friday's episode (20 October) as he expressed his desire to win back his soon-to-be ex-wife.  ""I love her to death, that's the mother of my child,"" the reality star said in a sneak peek video. ""I'm hoping that there's a small chance Kailyn and I can resolve whatever issues we have and give our marriage a legitimate shot.""",1

"The mother! of all relationships is over.  Jennifer Lawrence, 27, and director Darren Aronofsky, 48, have split after over a year of dating, PEOPLE confirms.  The two began seeing each other in September shortly after wrapping mother!, and their relationship continued to blossom despite their 22-year age difference. The private couple kept mum about their relationship while promoting the movie a year later and only posed together at the New York premiere of the film.  Evan Agostini/Invision/AP  The Oscar winner was first spotted dining with the Brooklyn native in New York City in August. They then spent time in Los Angeles in October, where they had an intimate dinner with her close friends at the Commissary restaurant at The Line Hotel.

"It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.",0
"Producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, who also oversaw the last show, will be reteaming with him for the 90th Academy Awards.  Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, ""If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.""  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  “Jimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,” Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. “Mike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.”  Added Kimmel, “Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.""  “It’s not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,” De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. “We always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.”  ""Our Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,"" Hudson said. ""Jimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer's love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.""  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, “After just one year, we can’t imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy’s skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen — and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we’re ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood’s most prestigious award.”  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show's producers and the producers then pick a host — a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy's board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year's show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who've already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year's show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year's show, which doesn't take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn't given the hosting assignment until early December. ""I had to be at least eighth [choice],"" Kimmel joked to THR. ""It took so long for them to ask.""",1
"Much has changed over the last year in Angelina Jolie‘s life, but one thing has remained constant — her dedication to her children.  After filing for divorce from Brad Pitt on September 19, 2016, Jolie retreated from the spotlight to focus on her family as they work to heal from the traumatic split.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I have had my ups and downs. I guess I am a little bit stronger,” the actress, director and philanthropist tells PEOPLE exclusively in an interview for the magazine’s new cover story. “We all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids. They are going through their formative years and everything else comes second to that.”  With her children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne and Knox, 9 — by her side, the superstar, 42, is back at work promoting First They Killed My Father, a movie she directed for Netflix (debuting Sept. 15) based on her friend Loung Ung’s memoir about surviving the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.  Alexei† Hay/Netflix  For all the details on Jolie’s new life, her emotional movie First They Killed My Father and her hopes for her kids, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  RELATED VIDEO: Angelina Jolie Brings All of Her 6 Kids to Premiere of Her Latest Movie  Jolie confirmed she plans on taking on more acting roles in the future, including Maleficent 2, but says her priority remains her children and their well-being.  “Everything will be around the children,” she says. “I haven’t worked for over a year now because they needed me home. Everything was just stopped. I’m really sitting and talking with them because everything affects them. Every location, every type of project, I’m going to have to adjust it to however much they can handle.”  George Pimentel/WireImage  Jolie, her kids, author Loung Ung and the young stars of First They Killed My Father at the movie’s Toronto premiere on Sept. 11.  RELATED VIDEO: Kids Interview Angelina Jolie  In the interview, an emotional Jolie also talks about how she misses her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of cancer 10 years ago, more than ever —and says her own health is good “so far” after her preventative surgeries to lessen the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  She’s very proud that Maddox and Pax got involved behind the scenes on First They Killed My Father. The movie grew from her longtime love for Cambodia, where she adopted Maddox in 2002 and where she has done humanitarian work for 14 years, establishing a foundation in Maddox’s name that helps local communities with education, health and more. “I wanted Maddox to see how extraordinary his country is,” she says of the movie.  Though they are still healing from the last year, the star says her family is out of “lockdown” and ready for new adventures.  “I think they’re itching to get out in the world again,” says Jolie. “We’ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.”",1

"The U.S. Supreme Court declined without comment Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer.""  Interested in Making a Murderer? Add Making a Murderer as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Making a Murderer news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  In 2007, Dassey was convicted as a teenager, along with his uncle Steven Avery, of murdering photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier before burning her body. He was sentenced to life in prison.  “We will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey. Brendan was a sixteen-year-old with intellectual and social disabilities when he confessed to a crime he did not commit. The video of Brendan’s interrogation shows a confused boy who was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how the murder of Teresa Halbach happened,"" Laura Nirider, an attorney for Dassey told ABC News in a statement Monday.  ""These officers repeatedly assured him that everything would be ‘okay’ if he just told them what they wanted to hear and then fed him facts so that Brendan’s ‘confession’ fit their theory of the crime. By the end of the interrogation, Brendan was so confused that he actually thought he was going to return to school after confessing to murder. Nonetheless, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on the basis of this ‘confession.’""  In 2015, Dassey's story rose to the national spotlight when his interrogation was shown as part of the Netflix series, ""Making a Murderer,"" which raised questions about the case.  Dassey's attorneys argued that their client is borderline intellectually disabled and was coerced into a false confession. They wanted his confession thrown out and were requesting a new trial.  “When you use these tactics on someone like Brendan, who is young, inexperienced with the police, naïve, compliant and suggestible, then you run the risk of getting coerced and false confessions,"" his attorney Steve Drizin said in February after asking the Supreme Court to review the case.  There was no physical evidence linking him to the murder, but Dassey was convicted based on statements he gave to Wisconsin investigators.",1
"Selena Gomez checked into a treatment center, and RadarOnline.com has the exclusive details about her latest rehab stint.  Justin Bieber’s 25-year-old girlfriend spent the last two weeks of January in a New York area treatment center and a source explained that those close to her were afraid of a drug relapse.  “Selena’s inner circle is afraid she is back on drugs and racing toward a breakdown,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Ex Justin Bieber’s ‘Tense’ Reunion Two Years After Split  The singer’s party lifestyle was enabled by her boyfriend, the informant claimed.  “The label just gave her another huge advance which, mixed with Justin’s resources — he’s covering her security and transportation — has led to some pretty heavy partying…even for her.”  Gomez cut off her mother, Mandy Teefey, in the middle of her latest breakdown.

She showed up 90 minutes late for the event and refused to walk the red carpet.  'She also insisted on only having her picture taken in a special room with her chosen photographer rather than alongside all the other stars at the bash. She was behaving like a diva.'

"Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban-Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes Used In Tom Cruise Divorce?  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban- Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes Used In Tom Cruise Divorce ”?:‘ Nicole Kidman ’ did not meet with lawyer who represented Katie Holmes in her divorce from Tom Cruise, despite a false tabloid report claiming the actress is ready to leave her husband ‘ Keith Urban ’. Gossip Cop can unleash this statement exclusively. A representative of the actress tells us it’s made.  According to Women’s Day, the actress recently met with Jonathan Wolfe, the high profile lawyer who helped Holmes get custody of his daughter Suri in 2012. The so-called “source” tells the magazine that Kidman has not officially requested divorce papers. Of Wolfe, but she consulted with him “to know where she was” should decide to end her marriage.  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban- Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes ”?:The store’s questionable source says, “ Nicole ” was extremely impressed with how Katie’s divorce and custody battle was handled, and she really liked Jonathan. She feels confident that he could help her win, no matter how unpleasant she may be. “The supposed person said that the couple’s friends are” expecting them to be able to solve “their problems, but a separation may be on the horizon.  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban ”?: The unreliable tabloid hides behind an anonymous informant, but Kidman’s spokesman tells Gossip Cop that there is no truth in the story. We’re told the couple’s marriage is strong. It is also important to note, the publication never bothered to mention the implications of Kidman and Urban’s alleged marital problems. They are said to “fight constantly,” but the seemingly imaginary source gives no further details.  Last month, People published an article detailing “Kidman” and ‘ Urban’s’ “secrets to a healthy and enduring relationship.” The story was based on a handful of recent interviews in which the 12-year-old spouses talked about maintaining a strong bond. Just three weeks ago, for example, Urban talked about his wife and children during a SXWS panel.",0
"It's the movie that helped launch three major Hollywood careers.  And on Monday night, Kevin Dillon revealed that he and his Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen still keep in touch 31 years after the film hit theaters in 1986.  Dillon, 51, shared a photo of the three men hanging out at what is believed to be Depp's Hollywood Hills home.  Together again: Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Kevin Dillon are seen in a photo posted to Dillon's Instagram on Monday night in Hollywood  Depp, 54, can be seen smoking in the snap as he places his hand on Charlie's chest.  Sheen, 51, makes a tough face for the camera as Dillon smiles on next to him.  Dillon captioned the photo: 'Platoon 30 year #reunion last night at #johnnydepp house #goodtimes @charliesheen.'  Platoon, which was directed by Oliver Stone, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987.  Hit: Sheen (L) and Dillon are seen in character in this photo from the classic 1986 movie  Here's Johnny: Most of Depp's role was cut from the film, where he played a translator  Sheen played the main character Private First Class Chris Taylor during the Vietnam war, while Dillon played a soldier named Bunny, and Depp a translator called Lerner.  Stone famously made his stars - including Sheen, Depp and Dillon - undergo intensive bootcamp training in the Philippines before the film was shot there.  A real life Vietnam vet himself, the director drafted Marine Corps officer and fellow vet Dale Dye - who would also play Captain Harris in the film - to put the actors through a 30-day military regimen.  Now and then: Sheen's career has been plagued by drug troubles and wild behavior over the years  They were made to dig fox-holes, go on forced marches, had limited food and water, were subjected to night time 'ambushes' using special effects equipment, weren't allowed to shower, had to sleep in the jungle, had rotated night watch, and were even kept awake by firing blank rounds.  The film was Depp's first trip outside the United States; Stone reportedly originally considered him for Sheen's role, but decided he was too young at the time.  In the end, despite all the intensive training, Depp was eventually cast in a much smaller role of a military translator Lerner, who saw most of his screen time cut from the final film.  From bad to worse: The Hollywood pin-up always had a wild streak, but shock claims of drinking and violent behavior have emerged in the wake of his split from Amber Heard  Nevertheless Stone predicted at the time Depp would go on to become a huge star; The Pirates Of The Caribbean also carried his experience on the film throughout the rest of his career, burying himself in intensely researched roles.  It's unclear how often that the three men have stayed in touch with each other since the movie, but they have all gone on to have major careers in film and television.  Depp and Sheen both developed reputations as bad boys alongside their successful acting careers.  Everybody loves Drama! Post-Platoon, Dillion is best known for his role as Johnny 'Drama' Chase on the HBO comedy series Entourage  Johnny was once handcuffed after a fight with then-girlfriend Kate Moss after causing nearly $10,000 dollars in damage to a hotel room in 1994.  He admitted to regularly 'poisoning' himself with alcohol and had a few reported scuffles, one with a security guard in 1989 and another with a paparazzi in 1999.  Depp appeared to have settled down after marrying his Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard in 2015, but when she filed for divorce the following year, shocking stories of drinking and abuse came to light.  In legal documents released earlier this year, it was revealed that Johnny's manager was informed that he kicked Heard during one particularly gruesome fight during their marriage.  Platoon: The Oliver Stone written-and-directed movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987  Charlie Sheen attended rehab for alcohol in 1990 and twice again 1998.  He married actress Denise Richards in 2002, and when they divorced in 2006, she alleged that he threatened to kill her after a complicated custody dispute over their two daughters.  More arrests and rehab stays followed for Sheen before his very public 2011 breakdown where he posted a series of erratic videos where he claimed to have 'tiger blood' and started his popular slogan 'winning!'.  Here comes trouble: Johnny became known as a bad boy but appeared to settle down after marrying Amber Heard in 2015, they divorced a year later with her claiming he was abusive  In 2015, Charlie announced he was HIV-positive after a blind item about him circulated on the internet.  Dillon worked consistently after Platoon and scored a major role in HBO's Entourage. Thought his troubles were not as high-profile as his co-stars, he did go through a nasty divorce from wife Jane Stuart this year and was involved in a 2015 altercation with a group of teenagers who were taunting him, but he was cleared of any wrongdoing.  Troubled: Sheen had been in-and-out of rehab for years before his public 2011 meltdown  In a 2012 interview with Mario Lopez for Extra, Sheen took credit for Depp's success.  When asked if there was a movie he regrets passing on, Charlie first mentioned that he should have done White Men Can't Jump, which starred Woody Harrelson.  Continuing his thought process about other films he was offered, he said, 'I should have done Nightmare On Elm Street, but if I had Johnny Depp wouldn't have a career.'",1
"It’s been nearly one week since the release of Demi Lovato 's newest album, Tell Me You Love Me and fans are still trying to decipher the meaning behind some of the album’s songs.  While Demi recently revealed the personal experiences that inspired the track “Daddy Issues,” she remains tight-lipped on the meaning of “Ruin the Friendship.” During an appearance on The Ellen DeGenres Show , Ellen tried her best to get Demi to confirm fan speculation that the track is about Nick Jonas .  “Supposedly there’s a song about Nick Jonas in here and because you claim to be so honest, I feel like you should be honest with that answer,” Ellen said. Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, “you know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.”  Questions from fans about the song’s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track’s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Nick.  Demi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation.  ""And I was like, 'You know what, I'm just going to write about it.' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,"" she continued. ""Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it's ballsy. It's like, 'Hey! Here's my feelings for you!' … They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.”  Fans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi’s upcoming YouTube documentary * Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated* set to debut on October 17, maybe we’ll get another clue.

The ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" alum also shared images from the special day on her Instagram story -- including a shot of Michelle making hot chocolate for the girls behind the rink's concession counter.  As always, she was careful not to show her daughter's face. Though earlier in the week, she happily shared a holiday selfie with her husband of 15 years, Freddie, 41, as well as photos and video of their kids' Christmas gifts under the tree.

In 2014, Witherspoon produced the thriller Gone Girl and received critical acclaim for portraying Cheryl Strayed in Wild, for which she earned her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and a fourth Golden Globe nomination. In 2017, she co-produced and starred in the HBO drama series Big Little Lies, for which she received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie and Outstanding Limited Series, winning the latter as a producer.  Witherspoon owns a production company Hello Sunshine, a clothing company Draper James, and she is actively involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She serves on the board of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of Avon Products in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010.  Early life [ edit ]  Witherspoon was born on March 22, 1976[1] at Southern Baptist Hospital, in New Orleans, Louisiana, while her father, Dr. John Draper Witherspoon, was a student at Tulane University medical school.[2][3] Dr. Witherspoon was born in Georgia and served as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve.[4][5] He was in private practice as an otolaryngologist until 2012.[6] Her mother, Dr. Mary Elizabeth ""Betty"" (née Reese), is from Harriman, Tennessee. Dr. Betty Witherspoon earned five degrees in total, including a Ph.D in pediatric nursing. She became a professor of nursing[7] at Vanderbilt University.[8] Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born John Witherspoon, who signed the United States Declaration of Independence;[9][10] however, this claim has not been verified by the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence genealogists.[11] Her parents are still legally married, although they separated in 1996.[12]  Because Witherspoon's father worked for the U.S. military in Wiesbaden, Germany, she lived there for four years as a little girl.[8][13] After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee.[8][14] Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the ""definitive Southern upbringing"" which she received. She said that it gave her ""a sense of family and tradition"" and taught her about ""being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you have in your life.""[15][16][17] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons.[18] At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair.[18] Witherspoon received high grades in school,[18] loved reading, and considered herself ""a big dork who read loads of books.""[3] On mentioning her love for books, she said, ""I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything.""[19] She has been described as a ""multi-achiever"" and was given the nickname ""Little Type A"" by her parents.[20][21] Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader.[22][15] She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major,[23] but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.[15]  Acting career [ edit ]  1991–1998: Career beginnings [ edit ]  In 1991, Witherspoon attended an open casting call for The Man in the Moon, intending to audition as a bit player;[15] she was instead cast for the lead role of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old country girl who falls in love for the first time with her 17-year-old neighbor. According to The Guardian, her performance made an early impression.[24] On her performance, Roger Ebert commented, ""Her first kiss is one of the most perfect little scenes I've ever seen in a movie.""[18] For this role, Witherspoon was nominated for the Young Artist Award Best Young Actress.[25] Later that year, she made her television debut role in Wildflower with Patricia Arquette.[4][9] In 1992, Witherspoon appeared in the TV movie Desperate Choices: To Save My Child, portraying a critically ill young girl.[4]  In 1993, she played a young wife in the CBS miniseries Return to Lonesome Dove, Nonnie Parker in the Disney film A Far Off Place and had a minor role in Jack the Bear, which garnered her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star.[4][26] The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film S.F.W., directed by Jefery Levy.[27] In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films: the thriller Fear alongside Mark Wahlberg,[28][29] as Nicole Walker, a teenage girl who starts dating a man with obsessive tendencies, and the black-comedy thriller Freeway, alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields, where she held the lead role.[30] Her character in Freeway, Vanessa Lutz, is a poor girl living in Los Angeles, who encounters a serial killer on the way to her grandmother's home in Stockton.[15] The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the San Francisco Chronicle, with Mick LaSalle commenting, ""Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other.""[31] Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star.[15][32] The making of the film also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, ""Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie – which scared me to death – I felt like I could try anything.""[23]  In 1998, Witherspoon had major roles in three movies: Overnight Delivery, Pleasantville and Twilight.[9][33] In Pleasantville, she starred with Tobey Maguire in a tale about 1990s teenage siblings who are magically transported into the setting of a 1950s television series. She portrayed Jennifer, the sister of Maguire's character who is mainly concerned about appearances, relationships and popularity. Her performance received good reviews and garnered her the Young Hollywood Award for Best Female Breakthrough Performance.[34] Director Gary Ross applauded her efforts saying, ""she commits to a character so completely and she understands comedy"".[23]  1999–2000: Rise to prominence [ edit ]  In 1999, Witherspoon starred alongside Alessandro Nivola in the drama thriller Best Laid Plans; she played Lissa, a woman who schemes with her lover Nick to escape a small dead-end town.[4] Also that year co-starred with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe in the drama film Cruel Intentions, a modern take on the 18th-century French novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The San Francisco Chronicle praised her performance as Annette Hargrove: ""Witherspoon is especially good in the least flashy role, and even when called upon to make a series of cute devilish faces, she pulls it off.""[35] She also appeared in a music video by Marcy Playground for the film's soundtrack. The film became a box office success and a cult classic.  Next came perhaps Witherspoon's career-defining role: starring with Matthew Broderick in Election, based on Tom Perrotta's novel;[4] for her portrayal of Tracy Flick, she received vast critical acclaim and won the Best Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics and the Online Film Critics Society, a first Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.[36][37] Witherspoon also received a rank on the list of 100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time by Premiere.[38] Director Alexander Payne said of her, ""She's got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend. But that's just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything.""[16]  In spite of her success with Election, Witherspoon noted in an interview that she struggled to find work after completing the film due to typecasting.[39] Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, ""I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about.""[5] In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in American Psycho as Patrick Bateman's trophy girlfriend, and made a cameo appearance in Little Nicky as the mother of the Antichrist.[33] She also guest starred in season six of Friends as Rachel Green's sister Jill.[40]  2001–2006: Worldwide recognition [ edit ]  The 2001 film Legally Blonde marked a turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, ""When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind of person you just can't hate.""[16] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, grossing US$96 million domestically.[41] Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics as the press began referring to her as ""the new Meg Ryan"".[42] Roger Ebert commented, ""Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit"",[43] and Salon.com noted that ""she [Witherspoon] delineates Elle's character beautifully"".[44] Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, ""Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly.""[45] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.  In 2002, after the success of Legally Blonde, Witherspoon starred in several roles, such as Greta Wolfcastle in The Simpsons episode ""The Bart Wants What It Wants"", and as Cecily in the comedy The Importance of Being Earnest, a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play in which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination.[46][47] Later that year, she starred with Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey in Andy Tennant's film Sweet Home Alabama, where she played Melanie Carmichael, a young fashion designer who intends to marry a New York politician but must return to Alabama to divorce her childhood sweetheart, from whom she has been separated for seven years. Witherspoon regarded this as a ""personal role"" in that it reminded her of experiences she had when she moved from her hometown Nashville to Los Angeles.[48] The movie became Witherspoon's biggest live-action box office hit, earning over $35 million in the opening weekend and grossing over $127 million in the U.S.[41][49] Despite the commercial success, critics gave Sweet Home Alabama negative reviews. It was called ""a romantic comedy so rote, dull and predictable"" by The Miami Herald,[50] and the press widely agreed that Witherspoon was the only reason the movie attracted such a large audience.[51][52] When describing Witherspoon's role in the movie, The Christian Science Monitor concluded, ""She is not the movie's main attraction, she is its only attraction.""[53]  In 2003, Witherspoon followed up the success of Legally Blonde by starring in the sequel Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde. Elle Woods has become a Harvard-educated lawyer who is determined to protect animals from cosmetics industry science tests. The sequel was not as financially successful as the first film and it generated mostly negative reviews. USA Today considered the movie ""plodding, unfunny and almost cringe-worthy"", but also noted that ""Reese Witherspoon still does a fine job portraying the fair-haired lovable brainiac, but her top-notch comic timing is wasted on the humorless dialogue.""[54] Meanwhile, Salon.com concluded that the sequel ""calcifies everything that was enjoyable about the first movie"".[55] Despite being panned by critics, the sequel took in over $39 million in its first five days in the U.S. box office charts and eventually grossed $90 million in the US.[56] Witherspoon received a $15 million paycheck for the role—a starting point to make her consistently one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses from 2002 until 2010.[16][57]  In 2004, Witherspoon starred in Vanity Fair, adapted from the 19th-century classic novel Vanity Fair and directed by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming she was pregnant with her second child.[58] This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: ""I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with"", she said.[59][60] The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness.""[61] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work ""an excellent performance that's soft around the edges"" and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is ""a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play"".[62][63] However, LA Weekly wrote ""[Witherspoon] ends up conveying so little of what's at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair"" and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, ""with an Oscar-less young star's need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the ""real"" Becky Sharp."".[64] Others have stated she was miscast.[65]  In late 2004, Witherspoon began working alongside Mark Ruffalo on the romantic comedy Just Like Heaven. Her character, Elizabeth Masterson, is an ambitious young doctor who gets into a car accident on her way to a blind date and is left in a coma; her spirit returns to her old apartment where she later finds true love.[66]  Earlier that year Witherspoon was chosen to portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never had the chance to meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time the singer died.[5] Witherspoon performed her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract.[67] ""That was the most challenging part of the role,"" she later recalled in an interview. ""I'd never sung professionally.""[68] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role.[67][69] Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added ""boundless energy"" to the movie.[70] She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for ""collaborative video of the year"" from the CMT Music Awards.[71][72] Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: ""I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems.""[73] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: ""I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman.""[73]  Witherspoon's first post-Oscar role came in the modern-day fairy tale Penelope, as Annie, the best friend of Penelope (Christina Ricci), a girl who has a curse in her family. The film was produced by her company Type A Films, with filming commencing in March 2006, immediately following Witherspoon's Oscar win for Walk the Line.[74] Although the movie premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival,[67][75] the final release date of Penelope was delayed twice before an eventual February 2008 release.[76][77]  2007–2012: Career downturn [ edit ]  Following her critical success with Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years ""kind of floundering career-wise"". Reflecting on this period of time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent ""a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs."" She claims that she ""wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there.""[78]  This period of Witherspoon's career began with the filming of the abduction thriller Rendition in November 2006. In the film, she plays Isabella El-Ibrahim, the pregnant wife of a bombing suspect. The film was released in October 2007 and marked Witherspoon's first appearance in theaters since the 2005 release of Walk the Line.[79] The movie received mostly mixed reviews and was generally considered a disappointment at the Toronto International Film Festival.[80] Witherspoon's performance was also criticized: ""Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly lifeless"", Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote. ""She customarily injects energy and spirit into her parts, but here, her performance feels tamped down.""[81]  Water for Elephants premiere in May 2011 Witherspoon at thepremiere in May 2011  In December 2007, Witherspoon began working with Vince Vaughn, filming the holiday comedy Four Christmases, a story about a couple who must spend their Christmas Day trying to visit all four of their divorced parents.[82] The film was released in November 2008. Despite being panned by critics, the movie became a box office success, earning more than $120 million domestically and $157 million worldwide.[83] In 2009, Witherspoon voiced Susan Murphy, lead character in DreamWorks' computer-animated film Monsters vs. Aliens, released in March 2009, becoming her biggest hit at the time.[84] She also co-produced the Legally Blonde spin-off Legally Blondes, starring Milly and Becky Rosso.[85]  However, Witherspoon did not appear in a live-action film for two years after the 2008 release of Four Christmases. She told Entertainment Weekly that the ""break"" was unplanned, stating that, ""I just didn't read anything I liked... There are a lot of really, really, really big movies about robots and things—and there's not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie.""[86] Witherspoon returned with three films released in 2010, 2011 and 2012, all centered on her as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men. In a 2012 interview with MTV, Witherspoon jokingly referred to this trio of films as her ""love triangle period"".[87]  The first film was James L. Brooks' romantic comedy How Do You Know[88][89][90] which starred Witherspoon as a former national softball player who struggles to choose between a baseball-star boyfriend (Owen Wilson) and a business executive being investigated for white-collar crime (Paul Rudd). The movie was filmed in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. during the summer and fall of 2009[91][92][93] and released on December 17, 2010. The movie was both a critical and box office failure. Despite a budget of more than $100 million the film earned only $7.6 million in its opening weekend, leading the Los Angeles Times to call it ""one of the year's biggest flops"".[94] The movie earned mainly negative reviews from critics, scoring 35% on Rotten Tomatoes with 111 reviews as of late December 2010.[95]  Witherspoon's second love-triangle movie was the film adaptation of the 1930s circus drama Water for Elephants. She began circus training in March 2010 for her role as Marlena, a glamorous performer stuck in a marriage to a volatile husband (Christoph Waltz) but intrigued by the circus's new veterinarian (Robert Pattinson).[96] The movie was filmed between late May and early August 2010[97][98] in various locations in Tennessee, Georgia, and California. It was released on April 22, 2011[99] and received mixed critical reviews.[100]  In September 2010, Witherspoon began principal photography in Vancouver for the third and final love-triangle film, This Means War, a 20th Century Fox spy comedy directed by McG in which Witherspoon's character is at the center of a battle between best friends (played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) who are both in love with her. The film had a ""sneak-peek"" release on Valentine's Day, before fully opening on February 17, 2012.[101][102][103][104][105] The film was panned by critics (with a 25% Rotten Tomatoes rating),[106] and fared poorly at the box office, taking fifth place on its opening weekend with sales of $17.6 million. The New York Times remarked that this ""extended the box office cold streak for the Oscar-winning Ms. Witherspoon.""[107]  2013–present: Comeback and professional expansion [ edit ]  Witherspoon's subsequent films signaled a departure from the love-triangle theme. In September 2011, a year after beginning work on This Means War, she filmed a small role in Jeff Nichols's coming-of-age drama Mud in Arkansas, playing Juniper, the former girlfriend of a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey), who enlists two local boys to help him evade capture and rekindle his romance with her.[108][109] Mud premiered in May 2012 in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, but did not win.[110][111] Following its American debut at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2013,[112] the film had a limited release in select North American theaters on April 26, 2013.[113][114]  Witherspoon next starred in Devil's Knot, which is based on Atom Egoyan's true crime book of the same name and examines the controversial case of the West Memphis Three. Like Mud, the film is set in Arkansas. Witherspoon played Pam Hobbs, the mother of one of three young murder victims. In an interview subsequent to her casting in the film, Egoyan noted that although the role requires ""an emotionally loaded journey"", he ""met with Reese, and... talked at length about the project, and she's eager to take on the challenge"".[115] The movie was shot in Georgia in June and July 2012.[116][117][118] Witherspoon was pregnant with her third child during filming.[119][120] The film's world premiere was held on September 8, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival.[121][122] It was then released in selected American theaters on May 9, 2014.[123]  In April 2013, Witherspoon began production in Atlanta on Canadian director Philippe Falardeau's film The Good Lie. It is based on real-life events, about a brash American woman assigned to help four young Sudanese refugees (known as Lost Boys of Sudan) who win a lottery for relocation to the U.S.[124][125] It was released on October 3, 2014.[126]  Witherspoon shot a small role in Inherent Vice (2014), an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel, in Pasadena, California in summer 2013.[127][128]  In 2012, Witherspoon, by herself, started the production company Pacific Standard. The goal of the company was to produce movies with strong female lead roles, as she said that she was tired of seeing only movies with a strictly male focus being produced. The mission of the production company is to focus more on stories about the trials and tribulations of women. Through the company, Witherspoon served as a producer in the film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl,[129] though she did not star.[130][131] Indeed, Witherspoon and her producing partner ""had little to do with the production of Gone Girl"",[132] leaving it to director David Fincher while focusing their efforts on another adaptation produced via Pacific Standard, that of Cheryl Strayed's memoir Wild, which began production in fall 2013 on the same day as Gone Girl.[133] Witherspoon starred in the project, portraying Strayed herself on her 1,000-mile (1,600 km) hike along the Pacific Crest Trail.[134] Wild was released in December 2014 to critical acclaim;[135] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune wrote in his review, ""Witherspoon does the least acting of her career, and it works. Calmly yet restlessly, she brings to life Strayed's longings, her states of grief and desire and her wary optimism.""[136] Wild was promoted as Witherspoon's primary ""comeback"" vehicle following her previous career slump,[137][138] and she earned her second Academy Award nomination for the role.[139]  In May 2014, Witherspoon began production in Louisiana on Hot Pursuit, a comedy in which she plays a police officer trying to protect a drug lord's widow (Sofía Vergara).[140] The movie was released on May 8, 2015.[141] In 2016, she had a voice role in the animated film Sing, as well as serving as a major performer on the film's soundtrack. The movie became Witherspoon's biggest hit, being the first to make over $200 million domestically and $600 million worldwide.[142]  In January 2016, Witherspoon began filming her first television project since Return To Lonesome Dove, the seven-part miniseries adaptation of the Liane Moriarty bestseller, Big Little Lies. She produced the miniseries, along with her co-star, Nicole Kidman, and the show's director, Jean-Marc Vallée, her second project under his direction. The series premiered on February 19, 2017 on HBO and finished on April 2.[143][144] Witherspoon has garnered critical acclaim for her performance, with TV Line proclaiming her as ""Performer of the Week"" of February 26 to March 4. The Washington Post compared her performance to her previous work in Election and Legally Blonde.[145][146]  In November 2016, Witherspoon began production on the romantic comedy Home Again, the directorial debut of filmmaker Nancy Meyers' daughter, Hallie Meyers-Shyer, which was released on September 8, 2017.[147] A few months later, she began filming Disney's A Wrinkle in Time, the film adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's classic novel of the same name, where she plays Mrs. Whatsit. The film was released in March 2018, co-stars Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling, and is directed by Ava DuVernay.[148]  In July 2018, Witherspoon began hosting the talk show Shine On With Reese on DirecTV. The show is a one-on-one interview between Witherspoon and a female guest focussing on how the guest achieved her dreams. Like Big Little Lies, the show is produced by her production company Hello Sunshine. The show marks Witherspoon's first unscripted role in television. [149]  Upcoming projects [ edit ]  In December 2017, HBO renewed Big Little Lies for a second season making the series a regular drama series series instead of a miniseries. The second season is expected to air in 2019. [150] Witherspoon has also signed on to produce and star in Untitled morning show drama series for Apple. [151] The series will also star Jennifer Aniston as a co-lead. Furthermore, Witherspoon will act and produce in the Hulu miniseries Little Fires Everywhere, the televised adaption of Celeste Ng's 2017 novel of the same name. [152] Witherspoon will also executive produce Are You Sleeping and an untitled comedy series, both set at Apple. All upcoming series will be produced through her production company Hello Sunshine. [153] [154]  Witherspoon also has two films in pre-production as a producer, A White Lie and an Untitled Martina Navratilova documentary. [155] [156]  Other ventures [ edit ]  Production work [ edit ]  Witherspoon owned a production company called Type A Films, which the media believed was a moniker honoring her childhood nickname ""Little Miss Type A.""[20][157] However, when asked about the company by Interview magazine, she clarified the name's origin: ""... people think I named it after myself... It was actually an in-joke with my family because at [age] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between type A and type B personalities. But I just wished I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life.""[5] In March 2012, Witherspoon merged Type A Films with producer Bruna Papandrea's Make Movies banner to create a new production company entitled Pacific Standard.[158] In 2016, Witherspoon and Papandrea split up, with Witherspoon gaining full control over the company.[159]  In November 2016, Witherspoon and Otter Media formed Hello Sunshine, a joint venture focused on telling female-driven stories on film, TV and digital platforms.[160] Pacific Standard has become a subsadiary of Hello Sunshine.  Other activities [ edit ]  In 2013, Witherspoon recorded a cover of the classic Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra duet, ""Somethin' Stupid"" with Michael Bublé for his 2013 album, To Be Loved.[161]  In May 2015, Witherspoon launched Draper James, a retail brand with a focus on fashion, accessories and home décor inspired by the American South. The brand is named after Witherspoon's grandparents, Dorothea Draper and William James Witherspoon, who are said to be her greatest influences. Some of the products are being manufactured and designed in-house, and the brand launched direct to consumers online before opening its first brick and mortar store in fall 2015 in Witherspoon's hometown of Nashville, Tennessee.[162]  In October 2016, Witherspoon announced that she would be writing her first book.[163] In April 2018, Witherspoon announced her first book Whiskey in a Teacup. The book is a lifestyle book inspired by Witherspoon's southern upbringing and will be released on September 18, 2018. [164]  In March 2017, Witherspoon became the storyteller-in-chief for Elizabeth Arden, Inc..

"President Donald Trump has broken his silence on the James Comey hearing, declaring that the nearly three hours of Senate testimony from the former FBI director on Thursday amounted to “total and complete vindication” of his actions after winning the election in November.  Trump sent a tweet at 6:10 a.m. ET that also criticized Comey for his admission that he leaked information to the media via an intermediary in an effort to force the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion during the 2016 election cycle between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. Comey’s gambit worked as another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, was named last month as a special counsel to the Justice Department to lead an independent probe.  There had been speculation that President Trump would offer his commentary on Comey’s testimony in real time on Twitter, but he waited until early Friday morning to weigh in.  “Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker!” the President wrote.  Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker! — Donald J.

Comey also asserted there was no doubt that the Russian government directed a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 election through hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s email system as well as through other cyber-malfeasance.  “There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever, the Russians interfered in our election,” Comey said.  The Comey has hearing generated a tidal wave of media coverage and analysis that will undoubtedly continue for many days.

"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom.

"John Cena and Nikki Bella had a lot of ups and downs in their six-year relationship, one of which was the time Bella revealed that she had been married before she met Cena.  The secret was one of the biggest plot points of Total Divas season 2, which aired in 2014.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  By that point, Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, had been dating for two years. She was even living with him, having signed his 75-page cohabitation agreement that forces her to move out all her belongings “as soon as possible” upon their separation.  But Bella was still hiding her past nuptials. And it turns out, it was not just from Cena.  During an emotional sit-down captured on camera, Bella told her family about her wedding for the first time — explaining to mom Kathy Colace, brother JJ Garcia and twin sister Brie (among others) that she was ashamed of her decision.  “I got married when I was 20. And got divorced at 23, to my high school sweetheart,” Bella said. “Basically we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it.”  The union was something Bella regretted from the beginning. “Even when I started walking down the aisle, I knew this was a huge mistake and how can I get out of it and I couldn’t,” she recalled. “I tried to forget about it but now it’s starting to come up, and I figured you guys have to hear from me before you hear from anyone else. It’s crazy ’cause John doesn’t even know and here we talk about marriage and we never bring it up.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Her family were not happy, especially Colace, who wondered why Bella didn’t think she could come to her.  But it was Garcia who showed the most anger, some of which was on behalf of Cena.  “John’s gonna be pissed. I’d be pissed for him if you hadn’t told him. ‘Cause you talk about marriage all the time with him, don’t expect it to be easy,” Garcia said. “[These things] really don’t just happen. You don’t just run off and get married and not tell your family for 10 years. That doesn’t just happen. You do what you got to do and I hope you figure it all out with John.”  It was Garcia who would accidentally spill the beans about the secret nuptial to Cena first, mentioning it at sister Brie’s 2014 wedding to her husband Daniel Bryan.  “I heard you’re handling everything awesome,” he told Cena. “For her to tell you that she’s been married before and you had no problem with it, I have to give you kudos man.  Cena look flabbergasted but kept the conversation moving.  Later, Bella finally got the courage to say something to Cena herself.  Luckily, having gone through a divorce (to ex-wife Elizabeth Huberdeau in 2012 after three years of marriage), Cena was more understanding than anything. Still, as the two had been fighting about marriage — with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again — he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him.  “When the focus of most of our problems has to do with that particular topic, maybe I should know that stuff,” he told Bella. “I know how you feel. You’re a human being, so I know you want certain things. But I would especially know how you feel about it because you had a bad experience.”  “I don’t care,” Cena added. “What you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don’t need to know everything about you. It’s just when you can tell other people and I kind of would like to be on that totem pole somewhere — I don’t have to be at the top … I just would like to be on it.”  Gary Miller/FilmMagic  Bella look relieved, though she said she did “feel bad” she didn’t tell Cena.  “I’ve realized that I need to start having confidence in my relationship with John and that he accepts me for all my faults,” she told the camera. “I am so relieved that John and I have made up and I’m just happy to be here with my family… honestly, nothing can go wrong now. Everything is perfect.”  RELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella End Engagement Weeks Before Destination Wedding  Cena and Nikki announced that they called off their engagement Sunday, a year after he proposed during WrestleMania 33.

"Hoda Kotb is a longtime news contributor and personality for NBC. In January 2018, she was named co-host of the opening hours of the network's flagship morning program, 'Today.'  Who Is Hoda Kotb?  Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot. Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show's opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, making this the first time two females have hosted together in Today's history.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Today' Co-Host  On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC’s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie.  Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today’s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Dateline' to Kathie Lee Cohort  Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008.  Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010.  Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing  Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who ""wanted us to be red, white and blue."" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt.  After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech University. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986.  Early Career  Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998.  Breast Cancer Survivor  Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram.  Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word ""forward"" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.

"That '70s Show is an American television period sitcom that originally aired on Fox from August 23, 1998 to May 18, 2006. The series focused on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in fictional Point Place, Wisconsin from May 17, 1976 to December 31, 1979.[1]  The main teenage cast members were Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon and Wilmer Valderrama. The main adult cast members were Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong and Tanya Roberts.  Cast [ edit ]  Teens [ edit ]  Topher Grace as Eric Forman (seasons 1–7; uncredited special guest season 8): Eric is a nice guy, geeky, physically slight and somewhat clumsy. He is a smart-aleck with a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. He convinces his parents to let his best friend Steven Hyde move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. His father, Red, is always hard on him. For seven seasons Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor Donna Pinciotti. He decides to become a teacher after high school and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa. Although mentioned in every episode, he does not appear during the final season until the end of the series finale.  Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart: The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, spoiled rich, selfish, often times annoying immature girl. She likes to give thoughtless and superficial advice, which occasionally turns out to be correct. As the series progresses she becomes more genuine, after her father, a crooked politician, goes to jail and her fortunes take a reversal. Partly as a result of these changes, Donna and she become better friends. By the end of the series, Jackie had dated three of the four males of the group: Kelso, Hyde and Fez.  Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso (seasons 1–7; special guest season 8): The dumb pretty boy of the group wants to coast through life on his good looks. Often referred to as ""The King"" in many episodes, he spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie, but their relationship comes to an end when Laurie (Eric's older sister) reveals their affairs to Jackie. He fathers a baby girl named Betsy from a librarian named Brooke during the seventh season. He becomes a police officer but gets kicked off the force because he does just about everything wrong. He gets a job as a security guard at a Playboy Club in Chicago and leaves the series during the eighth and final season. Kelso, along with Eric, returns for the series finale.  Danny Masterson as Steven Hyde: Eric's best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, the Formans allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother, making him a foster brother to Eric. Hyde has a witty, blunt and sarcastic sense of humor and a rebellious personality. He is also smart and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, in the final season he marries an exotic dancer named Samantha. Hyde later discovers Samantha was married to another man when she married him. As Donna points out in ""My Fairy King"", that means Hyde and Samantha are not legally married. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by Tim Reid), a wealthy black businessman (making Hyde, who was presumed white, biracial). Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first an office worker, then a manager and later the owner of the Point Place record store. He also previously worked for Leo in a Photo Hut earlier in the series.  Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti: Eric's longtime girlfriend (and briefly fiancée). Donna is tall, intelligent, good-looking. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends. Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Casey, Michael's brother and Randy during the final season and quickly ends it. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show's finale.  Wilmer Valderrama as Fez: The horny foreign exchange student of the group whose hormones are usually out of control. His country of origin is never named. He enjoys eating candy, drinking beer and looking at pornography. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes a ladies' man. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple.  Josh Meyers as Randy Pearson (season 8): Hyde's employee at the record store. He is introduced in the final season. Randy appears laid back, gentle, polite and a ladies' man, although many of his flaws surface later, encompassing parts of the departed Kelso and Eric's personalities and other attributes. Tall (like Kelso), he tends to spout witty one-liners (like Eric), and makes silly voices. He forms a friendship with Red after showing Red how good he is at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna and Kelso embrace him as a new member of their group, Fez initially does not, but soon warms up to him. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, but she later breaks up with him. The two end on good terms and remain friends. He makes a brief appearance in the series finale.  Adults [ edit ]  Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman: Red's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.  Kurtwood Smith as Red Forman: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. A conservative Navy combat veteran, he served in World War II and the Korean War. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing.  Lisa Robin Kelly (seasons 2–3; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and Christina Moore (recurring season 6) as Laurie Forman : Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often mock her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, ""bottomless dancing is legal"".  : Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often mock her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, ""bottomless dancing is legal"". Tanya Roberts as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1–3; special guest appearance seasons 6–7): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is the sexy neighborhood mom about whom Eric and his male friends fantasized when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after leaving Bob and moving to California. She returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a limited recurring role. She is temporarily replaced in Bob's heart by the aggressive, assertive Joanne (played by Mo Gaffney), tall like Midge but not as pretty. She and Bob meet in a supermarket. Red and Joanne almost immediately take a mutual dislike to each other.  Don Stark as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a veteran of foreign wars. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner.  Tommy Chong as Leo (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2–3 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four, but is later referenced in season five's ""The Battle of Evermore"" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.

The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address streaking, the sexual revolution, the Equal Rights Amendment, the 1973 oil crisis, and the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of the first Star Wars movie, which premiered in May 1977.  Throughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These, however, were largely abandoned after season 2, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, showing ""December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m."" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the registration tags on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. The final episode's closing credits showed an ""80"" year tag.  The show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, ""Grandma's Dead"", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach ""one"" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.  The show's unexpected longevity (it was the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation) combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series timeline sped up and slowed down with more rapidity near the series' climax, the timeline necessitated that several major events depicted as having occurred months apart would have in fact happened within weeks or even days of one another.  The timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, M*A*S*H aired for 11 seasons despite the Korean War only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters age faster than normal while other characters age naturally.  Eighth season and series finale [ edit ]  The character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[2] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[2] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an ""innocent character"", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[3] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers, was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[4] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle. Both Eric and Kelso returned for the series' final episode, although Topher Grace was uncredited.  The eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[5] and ""That '70s Finale"" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[6]  Production [ edit ]  Title [ edit ]  The working titles for the show were Teenage Wasteland (named after the lyric from ""Baba O'Riley"" by The Who), The Kids Are Alright (named after another song by The Who), Feelin' All Right, and Reeling in the Years (named after the song by Steely Dan). However, due to the denials of these three songs from the 1970s (including The Who's Pete Townshend's denial of using his two songs for each of the two titles), and Fox Network's decision that Feelin' All Right was not too memorable, co-creator Bonnie Turner suggested that the show should be titled That '70s Show, which ultimately became the official title for the show.[7]  Opening [ edit ]  Theme song [ edit ]  The show usually opens with the theme song, ""In the Street"", written by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell of the band Big Star. The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album #1 Record. In 2000, Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired, an amount he thought ironic, given the show's title.[8]  Big Star's original version of the song was not used on the show. Instead, a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick. Unlike previous versions of the song, Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase ""We're all alright!"" quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song ""Surrender"".[9]  Both versions of the song (Todd Griffin and Cheap Trick) used on the show end with somebody yelling ""Hello, Wisconsin!"" In Griffin's version, Masterson is the one yelling ""Hello, Wisconsin!""[10] while it is unknown who yells it in Cheap Trick's version during the opening. On the soundtrack, That '70s Album (Rockin'), Cheap Trick's lead singer Robin Zander yells ""Hello, Wisconsin!""[11] Alternate holiday versions of the theme song were arranged for Halloween and Christmas specials, using organ music and bells, respectively.  Opening credits [ edit ]  Opening credits for seasons 1–7 showed members of the cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together. At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).  After Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, Mila Kunis ""Hanging Out...;"" Danny Masterson ""Down the Street""). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were Kurtwood Smith and Tommy Chong, with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last ""We're all alright"". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears ""Hello, Wisconsin!"" The final episode omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.  Elements of the show [ edit ]  The 1970s [ edit ]  The show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as sexism, sexual attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking, including teenage drug use. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television remote (""the clicker""), reruns, VCR, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars.[12] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[13]  Beginning with the second season, the show focused less on the sociopolitical aspects of the story. For example, the dynamic of the relationship between Eric and Donna was altered in later seasons to more closely resemble the relationships of other ""power couples"" on teen dramas. Likewise, the first season of the show featured a recurring, more dramatic storyline in which the Formans were in danger of losing their home due to Red's hours being cut back at the auto parts plant where he worked. Storylines in later seasons were generally presented more comically and less dramatically.  The show also featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Betty White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Tom Poston and Jack Riley (The Bob Newhart Show), Pamela Sue Martin (The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries), Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati), Eve Plumb, Barry Williams and Christopher Knight (The Brady Bunch), Tom Bosley and Marion Ross (Happy Days), Monty Hall (Let's Make A Deal), Gavin MacLeod (The Love Boat and The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Don Knotts, Richard Kline and Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company), and Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family). Series recurring cast member Tanya Roberts also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (Charlie's Angels).  Beginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (Season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled ""That '70s Finale"").[14]  Split screens [ edit ]  One device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode ""Who Wants It More?"", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the ""caver"" will be owned by the other.  Dream sequences [ edit ]  The show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as Star Wars, Rocky, and Grease.  The character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode ""Stone Cold Crazy"", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in ""Eric's Birthday"" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in ""It's All Over Now"").  In the 100th episode, ""That '70s Musical"", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.  The circle [ edit ]  The circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in Eric's basement. The picture is of the final scene of the series.  In the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the ""drug-induced"" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word ""marijuana"" while in the circle (except in one episode ""Reefer Madness""), often referring to it as ""stuff"" or a ""stash"". In the episode ""Bye-Bye Basement"", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to ""weed""; in ""The Relapse"", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for ""smoking weed and beating up freshmen;"" in ""Ski Trip"" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in ""Eric's Burger Job"", Kelso blames his ""roach clip"" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (""That Wrestling Show"" and ""Hyde Moves In"") Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words ""Cannabis Sativa"" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in ""The Pill"" Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, ""That kid's on dope!"" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.  As the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are ""Class Picture"", ""I'm A Boy"", ""Substitute"", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.  The stupid helmet [ edit ]  The stupid helmet refers to a replica of a Green Bay Packers helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a ""dumbass"", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.  The water tower [ edit ]  In many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local water tower. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.  After Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was ""invincible"". In the ""Water Tower episode"", the gang painted a marijuana leaf on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving the finger. In the episode ""The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)"" Kelso paints Jackie and his names on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss on the tower in the show's finale.  Scene transitions [ edit ]  In the first season, scene transitions (also known as bumpers) consisted of animated smiley buttons[15] or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using Syncro-Vox, usually yelling, in a rock form, ""Yeahhh!"" or something similar (ex. Farrah Fawcett saying ""Yeah!"" or Richard Nixon saying ""Are you ready to rock and roll?"") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of lava lamps with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.  Beginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, lava lamp-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the episode usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.  By the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).  ""Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)"" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.  The Vista Cruiser [ edit ]  Many of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's ""Aztec Gold"" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.  The show's pronunciation of ""Vista Cruiser"", with emphasis on ""Cruiser"" conflicted with the pronunciation of author George Plimpton in the Oldsmobile television advertisement for the 1969 Vista Cruiser, where he pronounced the two words with the emphasis on ""Vista"".[16]  That particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for US$500.[17]  In August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.[18]  Running gags and catchphrases [ edit ]  In one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of catchphrase, ""kicking your ass"". For example, in ""Kitty and Eric's Night Out"", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, ""I swear I'll kick his ass!"" In ""Eric's Hot Cousin"", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, ""And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass"", and, in ""Prank Day"", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone ""horribly, horribly wrong"" Red says, ""Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!"" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.  Some other notable running gags and catchphrases are:  Red's favorite insult is ""dumbass"", the origin of which is revealed in ""Halloween"". Ironically, Eric is the first character to say ""dumbass"" in ""Eric's Burger Job"" (season 1 episode 5). The insult is adopted by the whole gang and even occasionally by Kitty. Red regularly comes up with new choice insults such as ""kettlehead"" (which refers to Kelso).  Fez's country of origin is never revealed. Sometimes, Fez is about to disclose where he is from, or at least hint at it, but something happens to prevent him from doing so, like someone entering the room as seen in ""Stolen Car"", or Fez rambling in ""Love of My Life"". [19]  Fez's real name was also never revealed. Even Fez stood for FES, Foreign Exchange Student. [20] [21] Red often calls Fez by some exotic foreign name when he is speaking directly to him.  Red often calls Fez by some exotic foreign name when he is speaking directly to him. Someone, usually Kelso, falls off the Water Tower. [22]  The word ""burn"", a term used by a character after something bad or offensive happens at another character's expense, although it is more often used by Kelso. According to Kelso in ""Dine and Dash"", a good burn consists of two elements: ""You didn't see it coming; parts of it really hurt.""  Hyde would usually give Kelso a punch in the arm for either his stupidity or bad behavior.  Kelso yells ""Ow, my eye!"" when Hyde rough-houses with him. For example, in the episode ""Class Picture"", a series of flashbacks feature Hyde beating up Kelso. While the two are out of the immediate sight of the audience, Kelso yells, ""Ow, my eye!"" and the scene cuts to the next flashback. This gag is repeated several times throughout the series, although the only time Kelso appears with an injured eye is in ""Jackie's Cheese Squeeze"" after he was punched by Todd, Jackie's manager. On that occasion, Kelso did not yell, ""Ow, my eye!""

"Kate Middleton wasn't always a royal — but she did some from a wealthy family. Eddie Mulholland - Pool/Getty Images  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn't always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton's net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here's everything we know about Middleton's net worth:  What is Kate Middleton's net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of two — who is expecting her third royal baby by the end of April— is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton's wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn't have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton's net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William's wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  What do we know about Kate Middleton's money?  Most of Middleton's net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew's. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton's net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn't need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family's royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million— as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.",1
"It's official: Pippa Middleton has confirmed she's pregnant with her and James Matthews's first child in a fitness column she wrote for Waitrose Weekend, a publication associated with the British grocer.

""I’m fanatical about sports and have looked at loads of books and websites on exercise during pregnancy but have been disappointed by the limited technical information on what you can and can’t do. I found that particularly so during the riskier first trimester. And this being my first pregnancy, I had so many questions I felt were all unanswered.""  Pippa wrote that she kept the news private when she first learned of her pregnancy and that unlike her sister Kate, she hasn't suffered from severe morning sickness. ""I was lucky to pass the 12-week [mark] without suffering from morning sickness,"" she wrote. ""That meant I was able to carry on as normal and continue most of my sports with better knowledge and, more importantly, professionals to learn from.""  ""I’ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it’s being strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth, and recovery,"" she added. Pippa will continue to write about her pregnancy experience for Waitrose Weekly, she ended her column.  So it's official: Princess Charlotte, Prince George, and Prince Louis are definitely getting at least one new cousin this year!",0

"Jennifer Garner has penned a heart touching message after visiting children affected by Hurricane Harvey in Huston, Texas, on Friday (8 September).

Children look for light,"" Garner wrote alongside photos of her with her fans that she shared on the photo-sharing application.  She added, ""Terrifying things have happened to these kids in the past couple of weeks, but they don't want to dwell on those stories. They want to tell you that their neighbor's puppy was found. That they saved their mother's life by throwing her a rope when the flood water overcame her and now she's ok. That they all celebrated when power came back on.

"Simmons has denied the claims.  KISS star Gene Simmons has reportedly settled a lawsuit that accused him of sexual assault.  The original case was filed by an unnamed radio personality last December. She accused Simmons of inappropriate touching her in an interview on November 1.  As she spoke to Simmons and bandmate Paul Stanley, the woman claims that Simmons touched her and “turned standard interview questions into sexual innuendos.”  Now, The Blast has secured court documents to confirm that Simmons has reached a settlement. The settlement amount is yet to be announced.  Simmons has denied the claims, and at the time insisted that he intented to “defend myself against any alleged charges you may have been reading about in the media.”  Earlier this year, Simmons spoke out on the MeToo movement.  The rock ‘n’ roll legend admits that the movements are generally forces for good, but has slammed the “collateral damage” of those he sees as falsely accused, as “there’s no presumption of innocence”.",1

"The road to Justin Bieber‘s upcoming album Purpose has been an apologetic one. In fact, saying that he’s sorry for his past has been one of the premiere promotional tools for his highly-anticipated follow-up to 2013 compilation Journals.  Even before he kicked off his notorious string of bad behavior in 2013 and 2014, however, Bieber has been offering mea culpas to fans for his actions, whether intentionally or accidentally terrible. Here are 22 of the 22-year-old’s best apologies.  1. Apology for ignoring British fans (2010)  “Wish I could have come out from the performance at the Mayfair but security wouldn’t let me. For those girls who cursed me out for it, I’m sorry, but sometimes I need to listen to security so no one gets hurt. But I like your attitude. The UK goes hard.”  2. Apology for ignoring Brazilian fans (2011)  “Love when the press think I’m annoyed because I look tired. I’m just tired. It’s normal. I’m not a machine. I’m in Brazil!! Not annoyed. I’m excited.”  3. Apology for ignoring French fans (2012)  “The other day in the airport I got surrounded by 20 paps. I don’t like small spaces, and I just wanted to get on the plane. I ran to get through the gate and there is a video of me running by fans and on the other side you don’t see the 20 paps. I would never run by my fans. For those that I did pass that day I AM SORRY. I know my fans are my everything. I know my responsibility to love them. I LOVE MY BELIEBERS.”  4. Apology for flipping off paparazzi (2011)  “Had a great bday and at the end of the night [Selena and I] got surrounded by paps and I reacted in a way I know better. I’m sorry. #killthemwithkindness. It’s not always easy but I know better than to react in anger.”  5. Apology for throwing up onstage (2012)  “I know that you guys don’t judge me, do you? You love me just the same, even though I’m throwing up all over the stage. You love me that much?”  6. Apology to Bill Clinton after cussing him out on video (2013)  “Thanks for taking the time to talk, Mr. President. Your words meant a lot. #greatguy”  7. Apology for canceled show (2015)  “I look forward to the opportunity to give my UK beliebers a great show in the near future and hope to honor my commitment to [the Prince’s] Trust at that time.”  8. Apology for canceled TV appearance (2010)  “Just want to let my people in Germany know I won’t be on Wetten Dass tonight as an accident has taken place and we all don’t think it is right to continue … I’m sorry we couldn’t perform tonight but some things are more important than putting on a show.”  9. Apology for smoking weed (2013)  “I also heard he got busted for smoking weed,” Bieber said in a Saturday Night Live sketch in reference to himself. “And he’s really sorry about it. And people make mistakes. And he’s never gonna do it again.”  10. Apology to China and Japan after visiting a controversial Tokyo shrine honoring fallen WWII soldiers, including war criminals (2014)  “While in Japan, I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine. I was misled to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. To anyone I have offended, I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan.”  11. Apology to Argentina for mishandling the country’s flag onstage (2013)  “People throw stuff on my stage all show and I get it to the stage hands to get off so no one got hurt. That video I saw a bra and thought it was a shirt. I’m being told by my team it was a shirt, but even if it was a flag I would never do anything to disrespect Argentina or the fans.”  12. Apology for walking off stage (2015)  “Sadly, it’s been a rough week for me, long days no sleep while having to be ‘on’ as they would say for cameras, fans, etc. In no way did I mean to come across mean but chose to end the show as the people in the front row would not listen … I don’t always handle things the right way but I’m human and I’m working on getting better at responding, not reacting.”  13. Apology for naked butt (2015)  “I deleted the photo of my butt on Instagram not because I thought it was bad but someone close to me’s daughter follows me and she was embarrassed that she saw my butt and I totally wasn’t thinking in that aspect. I felt awful that she felt bad. To anyone I may have offended I’m so sorry. It was completely pure-hearted as a joke but didn’t take in account there are littles following me!!!”  14. Apology to Love Live anime fans for a poorly worded tweet  “I’m really sorry for getting my otaku Beliebers’ hopes up, but I’m still not really sure which words in a sentence you need to capitalize so it ended up looking like I tweeted the title of the show.”  15. Apology for racist joke (2014)  “As a kid, I didn’t understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes but didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t funny and that in fact my actions were continuing ignorance.”  16. Apology for another racist joke (2014)  “Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever dealt with. But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger. I just hope that the next 14-year-old kid who doesn’t understand the power of these words does not make the same mistakes I made years ago. At the end of the day I just need to step down and own what I did.”  17. Apology to Ellen (2015)  “I think it’s just cool to be able to laugh at yourself. I’ve done some things. That might not of been the greatest. I just want to be able to own up to some of the things.”  18. Apology for appearance on Ellen (2015)  “It’s been a minute since I’ve done a public appearance, and I didn’t want to come off arrogant or conceited or basically how I’ve been acting the past year, year and a half.”  19. Apology for apologizing (2015)  “People often forget that [I’m human], even with their comments and stuff they think it doesn’t get to me, but it gets to me. Things that people say bother me, and I gotta be strong enough to keep it pushing. That’s why I wanted to make a video, just to let people know that I’m human … I’m passionate about being better and growing so I think that this is going to be an awesome chapter in my life.”  20. Apology at Comedy Central Roast (2015)  “There was really no preparing me for this life. I was thrown into this at 12-years-old and didn’t really know what I was getting into. There’s been moments I’m really proud of and moments I’m pretty disappointed in myself for.”  21. Apology to mom (2015)  “If it wasn’t for this woman, let’s just say I would have had a way LONGER stupid phase. I love you and thank you for not giving up on me!”  22. Apology for not apologizing (2015)  “Is it too late now to say sorry? Yeah I know that I let you down. Is it too late to say I’m sorry now?”",0

That’s not what she should be doing.”The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.",0
"Kylie Jenner attends the 2015 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)  Here are a selection of headlines People.com has posted over the past few days:  Pregnant Kylie Jenner Wants an ‘Easy Birth’, Says Source: She’s ‘Open to Pain Medicine’  Pregnant Kylie Jenner ‘Hasn’t Hired a Nanny’: She’s ‘Worried About New People Around the Baby’  Pregnant Kylie Jenner Has a Baby Name Picked Out for Her Daughter  Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as “We’re Expecting!” (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)

Khloe and her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, are also expecting a baby in March. Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie’s baby’s debut for quite some time.  “She very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can’t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,” a “source” told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. “She doesn’t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.”  Read more:  As Kim and Kanye welcome baby No. 3, the Kardashian deluge of 2018 has officially started  Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention  Perspective | Here’s why Chicago is actually a great name for Kimye’s baby",0
"© AP Image: Nicole Kidman, Keith Urban  Boy, is Keith Urban loved!  And that's exactly what the country star's wife, Nicole Kidman, told him in a sweet 51st birthday message Friday on Instagram.  The Oscar winner, also 51, shared a photo of herself giving her hubby a hug and kiss as they pose next to a gooey chocolate birthday cake from Rotier's Restaurant in Nashville.  ""You're so loved Keith Lionel. Happy birthday baby!"" Kidman gushed in the caption, adding the hashtag #keithsfavouritecake along with emojis of happy balloons, hearts, and, naturally, a cake with candles.  Kidman's ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Reese Witherspoon hopped into the comments to send her own sweet wishes to Urban.  ""Happy happy birthday KU! Sending you (love)!"" wrote Witherspoon.  Heartwarming displays of love between Kidman and her hubby are hardly unusual. After all, just months ago Urban encouraged the crowd at the Country USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kidman along with him.  Kidman, who wasn't at the concert, saw the sweet serenade on video — and then proudly shared it with fans. ""What a gift,"" she wrote.  What a gift indeed!  For more on Nicole, watch below:",1

But unfortunately for Kristen, life doesn’t have the ctrl+z option so she’s stuck with any mistakes she (might) have made – and embarrassing things she might have said.  Just one month before she was exposed as a cheat with Rupert Sanders, she revealed that she wants to have babies with her long-term boyfriend R-Pattz.  In an un-guarded moment, she told Vogue journalist Christa D’Souza: ""My God, I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I wish he were here now. I think I want to have his babies.""  Before adding: “I love the way he smells. And him me. Like, he loves to lick under my armpits.”  While it’s ultimately quite a gross thing to say, it proves that Rob found Kristen so amazing he was happy to lick her sweaty pits. But he’s not the only person to think his Twilight co-star is, er, flawless.  Rupert describes Kristen, 22, as ""amazing"" and ""flawless"" in the voiceover on the Snow White and the Huntsman DVD director's commentary.  It’s a fair assumption this was filmed before his fling with K-Stew became world (and wife Liberty Ross) knowledge.  (Image: Getty)  Before the affair, Rupert was asked whether Kristen and Liberty – who also featured in the movie – were friends.  He replied: ""She and Liberty didn't have very many scenes together, so they didn't get to know each other that well. But they definitely have similarities. There's a look they share.""  Yesterday, Kristen wore Rob's t-shirt which had the word IRIE printed on the front when she arrived in Toronto for the film festival.  And if you didn't know what that means, it stands for ‘the way you feel when you have no worries – to be at total peace with your current state of being’.  We feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes piecing together the hidden flirty messages.

"Strip That Down is the debut solo single by English singer and songwriter Liam Payne, featuring guest vocals from American rapper Quavo. It was released as the lead single for his forthcoming debut studio album on 19 May 2017, via Capitol Records in the UK and Republic Records in the US.[3] The song was written by Payne, Ed Sheeran—who contributes uncredited vocals to the song, Steve Mac and Quavo. It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 23 May 2017.[4] The song's accompanying music video was released on 2 June 2017. The lyrical content is supposed to reflect Payne's freedom to venture into raunchy musical elements after departing from the British-Irish boy band One Direction.  Background [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" features a guest appearance from Quavo (pictured), from the Atlanta-based hip hop group, Migos  After One Direction went on a hiatus, Payne, who co-wrote songs on each of the group's five albums, intended to focus only on songwriting. He told Billboard:  To be honest with you, I wasn't going to do a solo venture. I was just going to go into songwriting and carry on and do that. But then I was like, 'You've been trying to do this since you were 14 years old. You would be ridiculously stupid to turn down the option to have a deal.' Coming out of the band, we had some pretty good opportunities around us. I had to do something.[5]  The singer met Ed Sheeran in London in late summer of 2016, ""We went in, sat around and discussed a bunch of things about life, and [the song] basically just came together,"" said Payne. After working with Sheeran and producer Steve Mac, Payne decided to add Migos member Quavo into the mix as the song's featured artist.[5] While talking about how that collaboration came together in an interview with iHeartRadio, Payne said; ""I was thinking, like rapper time, it was going to take two or three weeks. But, we got it, played it straight away, and we were like, 'We absolutely love it.' He's a great man to have on the team.""[6]  Composition [ edit ]  Ed Sheeran (pictured) co-wrote the song and provided uncredited vocals to it. ) co-wrote the song and provided uncredited vocals to it.  ""Strip That Down"" is a trap and hip hop-influenced[7][8] pop and R&B track. Payne croons over ""pulsating"" synth-bass and chants with minimalist production style. Lyrically, the song contains themes of wealth, celebrity appeal and newfound career independence.[9] While talking about the song, Payne said; ""It just sets a few things straight, but then also the chorus is more about stripping back the music. I like to hear it loud sometimes, but sometimes you got to strip it back.""[6] For the concept of the song, Payne stated that they contemplated what Justin Timberlake would release as his debut solo single in 2017.[10]  ""Strip That Down"" contains an interpolation of 2000 single ""It Wasn't Me"",[11] written by Orville Burrell ""Shaggy"", Rikrok, Shaun Pizzonia, and Brian Thompson. ""It Wasn't Me"" interpolates War's ""Smile Happy"", composed by Sylvester Allen, Harold Ray Brown, Morris Dickerson, Lonnie Jordan, Charles William Miller, Lee Oskar, and Howard E. Scott. Therefore, they are also credited as songwriters.[12]  Critical reception [ edit ]  Rolling Stone staff called it a ""summer club banger"".[13] Writers from Billboard thought Payne ""seems to be aiming for a DJ Mustard/Tyga vibe,"" and concluded that ""the song's fun: The swaggering, Directioner-baiting pre-chorus especially, which is probably the JT-est thing any of the five members have done since going solo.""[14] Comparing it to One Direction's catalogue, Jordan Harris from Express and Star opined it ""is a lot more danceable, incredibly fun to listen to"" and added, ""Another similarity, and one which Liam would do well to use as a benchmark going forward, is the vocal style of Justin Timberlake.""[15] In Digital Spy, Laurence Mozafari wrote ""the song screams of trying to be grown up.""[16] Time magazine listed ""Strip That Down"" as one of the worst songs of 2017.[17]  Music video [ edit ]  On 18 May 2017, the lyric video for ""Strip That Down"" was uploaded to Payne's Vevo channel. The music video for the song was released on the same channel on 2 June 2017. The video was directed by Emil Nava.[18] It starts with a female dancer performing, followed by a black-and-white scene with Payne. As the video transitions from black and white to colour, it shows Payne in a neon world of bright lights, dancing, and an appearance from featured artist Quavo.[19]  Reviewing the ""sleek, colorful"" clip, Rolling Stone staff wrote: ""Payne rocks gently in what appears to be the inside of tanning bed.""[13] In Digital Spy, Justin Harp opined Payne ""sheds One Direction's wholesome image in the sexy music video,"" and added, ""The promo clip does exactly what it says on the tin, as the former boybander demonstrates his newfound hip-hop vibe while slinking around with twerking back-up dancers.""[20] Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the video is ""as awkward as the song"", saying: ""The Migos rapper appears completely at ease in his surroundings, while Liam looks like he accidentally wandered on to the set.""[21]  As of November 2018, the video has over 280 million views on YouTube, becoming Payne's first Vevo-certified music video outside of One Direction.  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" charted within the top 5 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single reached number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated 16 September 2017, becoming Payne's first top ten as a solo artist and Quavo's fourth. With his top ten, Payne became the third member of One Direction to achieve a solo top 10 single on the Hot 100, following Zayn and Harry Styles. In addition, One Direction joined The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and New Edition to have at least 3 members with solo Hot 100 songs reach the top 10.[22]  On Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, ""Strip That Down"" reached number one in its 4 November 2017 issue for both artists, marking a first for Payne as he became the first solo artist from an all-male vocal group to top this chart (as he has charted as a member of One Direction, whose ""What Makes You Beautiful"" peaked at number 13 in May 2012); he also eclipsed his fellow members, three of whom also had top tens on this chart (two from Zayn, one each from Horan and Tomlinson respectively; Styles' debut ""Sign of the Times"" peaked at 37 in June 2017). In the case of Quavo, it surpassed his featured collaboration (with Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) on DJ Khaled's ""I'm the One"", which peaked at number two in July 2017.[23]  Live performances [ edit ]  On 26 May 2017, Payne performed the song for the first time on The Graham Norton Show.[24] The singer also performed ""Strip That Down"" at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball on 10 June,[25] on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on 22 June[26] and at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on 12 November 2017.[27]  Track listing [ edit ]  Digital download[28]  ""Strip That Down"" – 3:24  Digital download – Acoustic[29]  ""Strip That Down"" (Acoustic) – 3:04  Digital download – Nevada Remix[30]  ""Strip That Down"" (Nevada Remix) – 3:44  Charts [ edit ]  Certifications [ edit ]  Release history [ edit ]",1
"Lindsay Lohan says she was “racially profiled” at London’s Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.  The Mean Girls actress, 30, said she was stopped by a woman who asked her to take her headscarf off. “She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘But please take off your headscarf,'” Lohan told U.K. television show Good Morning Britain. She added: “And I did, it’s okay. But what scared me was in that moment — how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”  Lohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds “solace” studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn’t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience “really jarring.” She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: “I’m from New York — I’m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.”  When Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was “out of respect” for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. “I was… leaving Turkey and… when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women — that’s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,” she said.  When Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. “I don’t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,” she said. “But at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what’s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they’re capable — or not capable — of.” However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away “or deleted.” Watch the clip below:",0

"Lil Wayne canceled his Sunday night concert at a Las Vegas nightclub after suffering multiple seizures in Chicago earlier in the day.  The rapper’s representatives confirmed to TMZ that Lil Wayne was again hospitalized following his continued struggle with epilepsy.  “Due to unforeseen circumstances Lil Wayne will be canceling his previously scheduled performance,” Las Vegas’ Drai’s nightclub said in a statement Sunday. “Our priority is the health and well-being of our artists. Everyone at Drai’s wishes Lil Wayne a speedy recovery during this time.”  Wayne was reportedly found unconscious at his Chicago hotel room Sunday after suffering a seizure. He was transported to the city’s Northwestern Memorial hospital, where he had another minor seizure, Reuters reports.  Despite efforts to get the rapper discharged in time for the Las Vegas show, doctors recommended that the rapper stay hospitalized for a few days, especially considering the multiple occurrences of Wayne suffering a seizure mid-flight.  In June 2016, Wayne’s private jet made an emergency landing in Omaha, Nebraska after the rapper had a seizure during a Milwaukee-to-California flight. The rapper spent at least one night at an Omaha hospital during that ordeal.  “I’m prone to seizures,” Wayne said in 2012, months after the rapper suffered a seizure aboard another private jet flight, which also forced an emergency landing and a Texas hospitalization. “This isn’t my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh seizure. I’ve had a bunch of seizures, y’all just never hear about them.”",1

"Khloé Kardashian sure likes dating athletes, but not all of them are the right fit for the Kardashian family. As many have learned, dating one of these sisters puts you under a microscope, leaving all your personal drama out for the world to scrutinize.  Just ask Tristan Thompson, Khloé’s current boyfriend. We all know a whole lot about how he’s allegedly neglecting his new kid to hang out with her. I suppose it takes a certain resilience to handle that level of attention. One of Khloé’s exes explained why he decided “thanks but no thanks” to joining the gossip mill.  Sports Illustrated interviewed Houston Rockets baller James Harden for their March 6 issue. Harden and Khloé dated for about 8 months in 2015 but broke it off. In the interview, Harden doesn’t say much about his relationship, but he does explain why living that tabloid life wasn’t for him.  “I didn’t like all the attention,” said Harden, “I feel like it was for no reason. I wasn’t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don’t need that. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t me. I don’t need pictures of myself when I’m driving my car. Who cares? What shoes am I wearing? Who cares? Where am I eating? Who cares? It was unnecessary stuff that I think trickled down to my teammates. I had to eliminate that.”  Oh my god! He doesn’t care what shoes he’s wearing? This guy is definitely not Mr. Kardashian material. Luckily, he seems to have quite a career going on and hopefully also some less public love in his life.  [Photos: Getty]",0
"Kimberly Noel Kardashian West[1] (born October 21, 1980) is an American reality television personality, entrepreneur and socialite.

That month, she also appeared on season ten of The Apprentice.[51][52] Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé wrote an autobiography titled Kardashian Konfidential, which was released in stores on November 23, and appeared on New York Times's Best Seller List.[53]  In December 2010, Kardashian filmed a music video for a song titled ""Jam (Turn It Up)"". The video was directed by Hype Williams; Kanye West makes a cameo in the video.[54] Kardashian premiered the song during a New Year's Eve party at TAO Las Vegas on December 31, 2010.[55] The song was produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, ""There's no album in the works or anything—just one song we did for Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's and one of my parents passed away from cancer. It's just all having fun—with a good cause"".[56] Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a ""dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature,"" and suggested that the single made Kardashian the ""worst singer in the reality TV universe.""[57]  That month, the International Business Times reported that Kardashian's 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, estimating them at $6 million.[58][59]  As of November 2016, as per CBC Marketplace and interviews with celebrity endorsement experts, Kim Kardashian was paid between $75,000 and $300,000 for each post that she posted on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter endorsing beauty products like waist trainers, teeth whiteners as well as Coca-Cola and well known charities. Experts think that celebrities offer fake glimpses into their lives to make viewers fall for their advertising pitches, curated to look as though the viewer is catching them in a spontaneous moment when they are mostly staged.[60]  2011–2015: Legal issues and focus on social media  Kardashian in Australia for the E! News: Red carpet and dinner in 2012  In April 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance ""Gold"".[40] Also in 2011, she filed a $20 million lawsuit against Old Navy and its parent company, Gap Inc. for right of publicity.[61] Old Navy used actress/model Melissa Molinaro in their Old Navy commercial featuring the actress singing and dancing. Kim Kardashian claimed that Old Navy used Molinaro as a look alike to Kim in order to promote their brand. Kim Kardashian was also seeking order to have the actress/model Molinaro banned from Old Navy commercials. The lawsuit never went to trial but a settlement was reached by use of a mediator in 2012; the exact settlement is unknown.[61]  In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled ""True Reflection"", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote.[62] That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse.[63] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim's manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[64] In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.[65][66] In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, ""Glam"", which ""draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle"", and was made available through Debenhams.[67] In summer of 2012, Kardashian and her family filmed a music video in the Dominican Republic to Notorious B.I.G's song ""Hypnotize"".[68]  Kardashian in September 2014  Kardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in Paper's winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude.[69] On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: ""Break the Internet"", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.[70][71] The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera.[72][73] A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and ""trying to tear down"" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was ""just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise.""[74] However, the stunt ""set a new benchmark"" in social media response,[75] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[76][77]  Kardashian voiced the role of an alien in an episode of the adult animated series American Dad!, in season 11 (2014–15) in the episode titled ""Blagsnarst, A Love Story"" on September 21, 2014. In the episode, her character crash-lands in the town of Langley Falls. The alien then develops an attraction to her fellow alien Roger.[78][79]  In June 2014, Kardashian released a mobile game for iPhone and Android called Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet.[80] The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in-game items.[81] The game was a hit, earning US$1.6 million in its first five days of release.[81] In July, the game's developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store.[81] In May 2015, Kardashian released a portfolio book called Selfish, a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself.[82] In December 2015, Kardashian released an emoji pack for iOS devices called Kimoji.[83] The app was a best-seller, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps that week.[83] In August 2015, Kardashian was the cover model for Vogue Spain.[84]  2016–present  On October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry.[85] The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag.[86] Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life.[87][88][89] She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped.[90] On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed ""on hold indefinitely"" after the robbery.[91] Production resumed on October 26.[92] Kardashian postponed a makeup demonstration in Dubai due to the incident.[93]  Kardashian made a cameo appearance in the heist film Ocean's 8, which was released on June 8, 2018.[94][95]  Fashion ventures  Kardashian is one of the many celebrity turned entrepreneurs who are able to leverage their television success by launching profitable side businesses. Kardashian is the founder of the television production company, Kimsaprincess Productions LLC, which produces workout DVDs, launched an eponymous fragrance line and the e-commerce shoe shopping website, ShoeDazzle. With her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, she also owns and is expanding D-A-S-H clothing boutiques, designed a clothing line for Bebe and nabbed diet (Quick Trim) and skincare (PerfectSkin) products endorsements.[96][97]  In 2006, Kardashian entered the business world with her two sisters and opened the boutique shop D-A-S-H in Calabasas, California.[34] In 2007, Kardashian and three partners Brian Lee, Robert Shapiro and MJ Eng founded ShoeDazzle, an online shoe and accessories website. The site now boasts more than 3 million customers, who pay a monthly fee for access to a personalized selection of shoes, jewelry and handbags every month. The site also landed a $40-million investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.[98] The company is valued at $280 million as of 2012.[99][100][101][102] In March 2009, she launched an endorsement with her company, ShoeDazzle shopping,[103] of which she is the co-founder and chief fashion stylist.[44] She then endorsed multiple other projects including a vanilla cupcake mix flavor called 'Va-Va-Va-Nilla' for the bakery, Famous Cupcakes.[44]  Beginning in early 2010, Kardashian and her sisters designed and developed clothing lines for Bebe stores and 'Virgins, Saints, and Angels'.[104][105][106] In April 2010, Kardashian and her sisters released a sunless tanner ""Kardashian Glamour Tan"", that month.[107] In October 2011, Kardashian and her sisters opened their Kardashian Khaos store in Las Vegas.[108] In November 2012, Kardashian and her sisters internationally launched the 'Kardashian Kollection' in England,[109][110] as well as launching a line of cosmetics, 'Khroma Beauty'.[111]  Personal life  Marriages  In 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[112] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later credited their separation to physical and emotional abuse on his part.[113] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[112]  In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[114] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[115] Earlier that month, she had released her ""wedding fragrance"" called ""Kim Kardashian Love"" which coincided with her own wedding.[40][116] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding.[117] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[118] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[119] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case which included an apology from Jaxson.[120] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[121] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[122]  Kardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[123] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[124] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[125] and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[126] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[127] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[128]  The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as ""a historic blizzard of celebrity.""[6]  Religion  Kim Kardashian is a Christian and has described herself as ""really religious"".[129] Each morning, she and her family partake in a group chat in which they discuss a daily verse from the Bible.[129] She was educated in Christian schools of both the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions.[129]  In April 2015, Kardashian and West traveled to the Armenian Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem to have their daughter, North, baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church. The ceremony took place at the Cathedral of St. James.[130] Khloe Kardashian was appointed the godmother of North.[131]  Health and pregnancies  Kardashian gave birth to her first child with West, daughter North West, on June 15, 2013.[132] She gave birth to her second child, son Saint West, on December 5, 2015.[133] Kardashian has been very open about her difficult pregnancies. With her first pregnancy, she suffered preeclampsia, which forced her to deliver at 34 weeks. She also suffered placenta accreta after delivery, eventually having to have surgery to remove the placenta and subsequent scar tissue.[134] After her second pregnancy, her doctors advised against trying to become pregnant again.[135] The couple's third child, a daughter, was born via surrogate on January 15, 2018.[136] On January 19, 2018, her name was announced as Chicago West.[137][138]  Wealth  As of May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45 million.[139] In 2015, Forbes reported she had ""made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million"", and reported that she ""has monetized fame better than any other"".[140] Much of her income include wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which raked in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored Instagram and Twitter posts which are collectively worth $10,000–25,000 per post.[141] As of July 2018, Kim is worth US$350 Million[142]  Advocacy  Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry.[143][144] She is not a citizen of either country and cannot speak Armenian.[145] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[146][147][148]  In April 2015, she traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khloé, and her daughter North and visited the Armenian Genocide memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan.[149] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[150] During an interview with GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Liberal Republican, fiscally conservative but socially progressive.[151]  Kardashian advocated for the commutation of the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense, which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018.[152]  Filmography  As herself  As actress  Music videos  Discography  List of singles, with selected chart positions Title Year Peak chart  positions Album US  [172] US  Heat.

"Amal Clooney is pregnant with twins who are due in June and with the help of husband, George, they are actively looking for nannies – not any nannies – ugly ones.  Mr. and Mrs. Clooney are very busy people, their respective careers take them all over the world and sometimes they are even forced to travel to dangerous and war-torn countries.  The pair also shares three mansions in California, Italy, and England, so it is not surprising that the parents-to-be have begun looking for an extra pair of hands to help them with their bundle of joys.  Anxious to play the biggest role in his life, the father-to-be was eager to start interviewing candidates who were qualified for the job when he learned that Amal’s primary concern is the nanny’s looks.  The actor’s wife does not want a beautiful woman to help her raise her twins because she has watched so many marriages destroyed by young, hot and fit help.  The international human rights lawyer, 39, is aware that her spouse is considered as one the most handsome men in the world and has dated half of the stunners in Hollywood, so she will go out of her way to make sure he is never tempted.  A source close to the respected attorney had the following to say: “Amal refuses to end up like Jennifer Garner or Gwen Stefani, and so she’ll hire dowdy helpers, so her spouse won’t be tempted to stray.”  The insider went on to explain: “She trusts George, but she’s seen way too many A-list men get sucked in by starstruck caregivers. She married the sexiest bachelor alive, and she intends to protect him from any potential honey trap.”  Advertisement  If the Oscar-winning actor wants to cheat, he will find a way to do it, Amal and her unattractive nannies can not stop him.",0
"So sweet! Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.  “OK, I know I’m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife’s new show – @thesinnerusa – is amazing,” the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. “It’s like nothing I’ve seen her in before, and she’s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. –JT.”  The actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a “whydunit” rather than a “whodunit,” follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. “I just did it. And I don’t know why,” a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.  Biel opened up about The Sinner, which is based on Petra Hammesfahr‘s 2008 novel of the same name, during a recent appearance on the Today show. “We are not looking for who, we are looking for why,” she said of the plot. “Why did this seemingly normal young woman who has a family and a child and husband, why did she do this horrific act? … We all as human beings have the possibility to snap and we don’t do it. But what makes us cross the line?”  The 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she’d react if her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. “It’s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it’s hard to say yes because it’s such an intense experience,” she said on Today. “It’s a tough business. It’s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.”  The Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.

"Destiny’s Child line up at one time consisted of LaTavia Roberson, LeToya Luckett, Kelly Rowland, and Beyonce Knowles (Picture: Everett/REX/Shutterstock)  Question: tell me what you think about…this.  A fan theory is doing the rounds online that we are so here for – we could have a Destiny’s Child reunion on our hands.  Original members LaToya and LaTavia could well be teaming up with Bey, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland, if this is all to be believed.  The theory goes that Destiny’s Child are reuniting for Coachella 2018 and it would appear they have each been dropping hints to suggest it.  AND WE ALL KNOW BEYONCE LOVES A HINT DROP.  Example one: the album hint.  Example two: The twins hint.  Beyoncé told us in Dec. she was having twins 😩. She was holding up two fingers. Lordt it's like when she was smelling the lemon. #Beyonce pic.twitter.com/tbbQ3gH02P — Damedashbk (@DameDashBEYk) February 2, 2017  So here is the fan theory, discovered by Buzzfeed, encapsulated in one handy tweet and a quick explanation.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Beyonce uploaded a snap of herself wearing an AC/DC top, but only showed the DC. DC = Destiny’s Child. Boom.  Michelle Williams uploaded a snap of the outfit she wore when she last performed with Destiny’s Child at the Super Bowl, you know, just to remind us she was once in the group.  Yes Yes Yes! (Picture: Kevin Mazur/WireImage)  Original DC member LaTavia has piped up too, telling her fans ‘I have so much to tell you guys’…  And lastly, other original LaToya shared a picture of the quartet together back in the day. What a strange time to suddenly do a flash back….or is it?  THEY. ARE. COMING. COACHELLA IS ABOUT TO BE LEGENDARY. pic.twitter.com/5RMCahlvAS — Getaway Car 🐍 (@DaKingKK) December 12, 2017  Now it’s Kelly’s move.  Coachella would be the ultimate place for a reunion, especially as Beyonce had to pull out last year, what with being pregnant with twins and all, and is now headlining for 2018.

"Kendall Jenner is now the only member of the Kardashian family who doesn't have a child. Kim and her husband Kanye West have three: North, Saint, and Chicago. Kourtney co-parents Mason, Penelope, and Reign with her ex partner Scott Disick. Rob Kardashian has a daughter, Dream, with his ex Blac Chyna. Kendall's younger sister, Kylie, welcomed her first baby (a daughter named Stormi Webster) with boyfriend Travis Scott in February. And just last month, Khloé Kardashian welcomed her first child (also a daughter, named True) with boyfriend Tristan Thompson.  In a new interview with Elle magazine, Kendall admits that even she can barely keep up with the amount of babies joining the Kardashian-Jenner group. ""[My family is] forever growing,” Jenner said while chatting with Lana Del Rey for the magazine. “Every time I think it’s eased up, someone’s popping out a baby.”  Kendall specifically talked about Kylie's birth during her interview. “It’s obviously a bit weird that your little sister is having a baby before you,” she said. “I didn’t expect it to happen like this. But it’s beautiful.” Not only has Kylie taken to motherhood well, Kendall says it's also made her a more loving sister in general. “It’s brought us closer together. We’ve always been very close, but we would butt heads all the time. This has made her a bit more loving toward me,"" she said.  Kendall and Kylie are often grouped together as the two youngest siblings—they have a joint clothing line, after all—but that doesn't mean they don't fight. One such spat, Kendall says, was over their mutual celebrity friend Hailey Baldwin. “She was actually best friends with Kylie, and I was good friends with her cousin Ireland [Alec Baldwin’s daughter],” Kendall says. “Hailey lived in New York, and whenever we were there, we would hang out with her.”  The two models soon became close during New York Fashion Week, as one does—which briefly irked Kylie. “From then on, [Hailey] was my homie,” Kendall said. “At first, Kylie was mad; I had to bring them back together and be like, ‘No, it’s okay, guys.’ But it’s all good; that’s our love story.” Love story, indeed.

"On November 27th last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement to the world.  Many were quite shocked as the Suits actress showed off her sparkling ring with diamonds that were once owned by his late mother, Princess Diana, as they had only been dating for 18 months.  Prince Harry told the BBC in their official engagement interview, ""She didn’t even let me finish (proposing). She said, ‘Can I say yes? Can I say yes?’ And then was hugs and I had the ring on my finger and I was like, can I give you the ring? She goes, ‘Oh yes, the ring.’ So no it was a really nice moment, it was just the two of us and I think managed to catch her by surprise as well."" If the couple are to marry, then she will become the first American in 81 years to marry into the Royal family since Wallis Simpson married King Edward VIII, forcing his abdication from the throne.  Although the couple appeared to be happy, as time has gone by there have been a few scandals and complications. These are all the reasons why this romance is becoming less of a fairytale and more like it's heading for the rocks.  advertising  15 Why Did Harry Really Push Meghan's Hand Away In This Video?  express.co.uk  When you're one of the most photographed couples in the world, the paparazzi will be sure to capture moments you don't quite want to be made public.  Like in this video when Harry and Meghan were in Brixton for charity work, she reaches out for her hand but he shuns her away with no explanation.  Was there a fight in the car before they arrived? Or has the couple just been spending too much time together carrying out their Royal duties?  Locals weren't overjoyed by the visit as one accused their charity work of being a 'stunt'. Local storeowner Mike Eweje told the Daily Express, ""It’s a stunt for the Royal family. People don’t care about the Royal wedding because they don’t care about people around here.""  14 Has Meghan Been Dishonest About The Royals Since The Very Beginning?  mix967.ca  advertising  According to Meghan, she didn't know anything about the Royal family before she met her Prince but a high school friend has revealed that's not true. Ninaki Priddy, who has known the former actress since she was 11, told the Daily Mail, ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating.""  ""She had one of Princess Diana’s books (Diana: Her True Story) on her bookshelf, and even when she was with (her ex-husband) she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  The ex-BFF also added that fame had completely changed Meghan, she said, ""Maybe she had started to change before then, but I was refusing to see it. The tone of her voice, her mannerisms, the way she laughed didn’t seem real to me anymore.""  13 Marriage Of Royalty And Hollywood Is Too Risky For House Windsor  businessinsider.com  For many commentators, the marriage of Hollywood and Royalty simply doesn't work and could even be the end of House Windsor.  One anonymous staffer who works inside the palace told the Daily Star, ""I know Her Majesty and the Prince of Wales are not happy with her. It is very serious.""  The monarchy is already fragile as the public has less patience with the Royal ways, so could this marriage be the final nail in the coffin?  Max Hastings from the Daily Mail revealed, ""Now that Ms. Markle has gushed all over Vanity Fair about her relationship with Harry for no better purpose than to satisfy a yearning for fame, she cannot at some future date reinvent herself as a princess. The monarchy is sustained by a web of delightful illusions and fantasies that are based on the concealment from the eyes of us commoners, the humdrum ordinariness of the Royal Family’s individual members.""  12 Harry Is The Ultimate Commitment-Phobe  vanityfair.com  advertising  It's fair to say that Prince Harry isn't the type of guy who likes commitment. He is well known for his on-and-off relationship with Chelsea Davey that lasted for a bumpy seven years and she was even his date at his brother's wedding. He also dated TV presenter Natalie Pinkham, he enjoyed drink dates with Kate's good friend Astrid Harbord and he was hooking up with presenter Caroline Flack as well.  Flack recalls, ""Once the story got out, that was it. We had to stop seeing each other. I was no longer Caroline Flack, TV presenter, I was Caroline Flack, Prince Harry's bit of rough.""  It's been tough for any woman to try and get him to commit for good and there is always the chance he will get cold feet before the big day. One source told The Daily Beast, ""There is always room for doubt because he is a serial commitment-phobe. He is said to be a ‘love addict’ and his parents’ example is far from encouraging.""  11 Meghan Forced To Erase Her Whole Social Media History  usanetwork.com  Meghan, just like the rest of us, loved her social media and would regularly update her accounts with pictures of her on a holiday or relaxing at home. However, there is no place for Instagram or Twitter in the Royal family, so those accounts had to go for good.  She also had to shut down her own lifestyle blog, The Tig, after she started dating Harry.  The official statement from the palace said she was ""grateful to everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years"" but had closed them ""as she has not used these accounts for some time."" Meghan will likely be devastated that she no longer has social media, as she loves the attention. Her former BFF revealed, ""She just loved to be the center of attention. We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practice announcing herself.""  10 They Have Only Known Each Other For 18 months  abcnews.go.com  advertising  When Harry popped the question he had only known Meghan for 18 months, but he was clearly in a rush to get her down the aisle.  Things didn't go so well in the beginning as Harry issued a statement to the press asking for the ""abuse and harassment"" of his girlfriend to end.  Then on November 27th last year, Clarence House and Kensington Palace both announced that Harry and Meghan were engaged, but was it all happening too fast?  The couple hasn't spent that much time together as they have both been busy, Harry in the UK and Meghan in the USA. According to many studies, those who waited for three years before getting married had decreased the likelihood of divorce by 50%. Rushing into things might spell doom for the couple before they even know it.  9 Meghan's Half-Sister's Book Could Destroy Everything  usmagazine.com  One thing the Royal family won't be looking forward to is the release of Meghan's half-sister's tell-all book. Samantha Grant who lives in Florida claims she raised Meghan herself as the two were growing up.  She also revealed that her half-sister is a ""social climber"" and has always had a ""soft spot for gingers"".  The current working title for the book is 'The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister' so it's pretty clear what kind of book this going to be.  She also revealed that their father is bankrupt, but Meghan hasn't reached out to help. When Meghan wore a $75,000 designer dress for her engagement photo, her sister said, ""If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad."" He filed for bankruptcy last year with just $200 to his name.  advertising  8 Meghan Won't Be Able To Cope With The Terrifying Publicity  via: Pinterest.com  advertising  20 years ago, Harry's late mother Princess Diana was chased by the paparazzi and crashed in a Paris tunnel, which resulted in her death. The cameras were still flashing even as they struggled to pull her body from the wreck. Now, you would think the media learned from the incident and they would be less intrusive, but it appears they have just become worse.  Last year, she was the most searched woman on Google and her name dominates the headlines almost every day.  Top bodyguard Garry Curtis who once looked after the Beckham family told the Mirror online, ""I can only imagine that at the start she will find it extremely claustrophobic. Any family that has financial wealth around them is going to be a potential target of intimidation, possible kidnap, these days computer theft and hacking and people looking for family photos for blackmail."" Sounds terrifying to us.  7 Meghan's Ex-Husband Is Making A Comedy About Their Divorce  radaronline.com  Another person who was once close to Meghan and also wants to sell her out is the ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, who was married to the Suits star from 2011 to 2013.  Now it's been revealed that he plans to make a tell-all comedy about their divorce and the pilot has been ordered by Fox network.  The show is about a divorced dad who has to work with his ex-wife to share custody of their kids, according to Deadline. The situation is complicated as the woman moves on from the split by marrying a British prince and although they never had children together, it's going to be quite obviously about Meghan and Harry.  So far, Modern Family's executive producer Danny Zuker has joined the project as producer and writer. It's yet another embarrassing blow for the Royals who will already see Meghan's divorce as a setback.  6 The Queen Will Refuse To Attend The Big Day  vanityfair.com  advertising  It's very likely that the Queen will snub the Royal wedding even though she would be a crucial and celebrated guest. According to speculation, the Queen won't witness the nuptials first-hand because Meghan has been married before. In 2005, her majesty didn't attend the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla for the exact same reason - choosing to skip her son's big day.  A senior Royal official told the Daily Express, ""The Queen takes her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England incredibly seriously. She also has great personal faith.""  Her former best friend told the Daily Mail that Meghan's husband did not see the divorce coming, she revealed, ""I think everybody who knew them both was in shock. All I can say now is that I think Meghan was calculated, very calculated, in the way she handled people and relationships.""  5 She Has Already Failed A Mock British Citizenship Test  mirror.co.uk  Maybe British history isn't Meghan's strong point, but if she wants to make a permanent move to the UK then she'll have to brush up for the citizenship test.  She sat down with comedy channel Dave who quizzed her on all things British but she failed to name local ales or where places were.  It's believed that she will leave her Toronto apartment behind and relocate to London with Harry and her dogs at Kensington Palace. They will then become the next-door neighbors of Prince William and Kate.  She told the host, ""Because I'm from the States, you don't grow up with the same understanding of the Royal family. While I now understand very clearly there's a global interest there, I didn't know much about (Prince Harry).""  4 Meghan Has Too Many Skeletons In Her Closet  via: YouTube.com  advertising  Meghan's family history comes with quite a dark past; her half-brother, Tom, has spent a few nights in a jail cell following boozy fights and he also pointed a gun at her sister-in-law's head. One source told The Sun, ""He’s a loose cannon. It puts Meghan’s family in a bad light again. The last time he said he would get help. Everyone hopes they both do so now.""  Meghan's father also has his own demons as he is struggling with bankruptcy.  Meghan's half-sister said Harry would be ""appalled by what she's done"" and that Meghan was a ""narcissist"" and ""selfish"".  She told the Daily Mail, ""The Royal Family would be appalled by what she's done to her own family. The truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry, he wouldn't want to date her anymore because it puts her in a bad public light."" We're sure her pending tell-all book will go into much more detail...  3 The Big Day Is Too Much Of A Clash With The Next Royal Baby  via: YouTube.com  The big day might have to be put on hold, as it's too much of a clash with the next Royal baby. William and Kate are expecting their third child, who will be fifth in line to the throne. The newborn is expected early April, however, if things become overdue it will clash with the Royal wedding.  William is expected to be the best man on the big day, so this could put the brakes on the occasion.  The website Mumsnet was flooded with complaints by angry parents about the clash in dates. One wrote, ""It'll be a dilemma for William as he'll want to celebrate the day, as will Catherine. If she's heavily pregnant or postpartum, he can't really get overly drunk."" If things are going to get complicated, the couple might be better off calling the whole thing off.  2 Meghan Is Still Breaking Protocol By Talking To The Press  via: YouTube.com  advertising  After Harry and Meghan first announced their engagement, they both made a public outing in London to greet the crowds of well-wishers. Harry, walking ahead of Meghan, was shaking hands with the public and taking gifts, but when ITV’s Alison Hammond tried to talk to him, he quickly swerved her microphone. Something Harry isn't keen to do is talk to the press. However, the same couldn't be said for Meghan who walked right up to the reporter for a chat.  Meghan's Vanity Fair interview, where she discussed in detail about her relationship with the Prince, would have ruffled a few feathers at the palace.  She landed the cover and the title screamed, ""She just mad about Harry!"" It's this kind of 'vulgar Hollywood' publicity the Royals have tried to keep away from for many decades.  1 Even Psychics Say It's Doomed  AOL.com  Unfortunately for this couple, it's written in the stars that it just wasn't meant to be. Psychic Kerrie Erwin appeared on Australian morning show Sunrise and claimed the couple would 'struggle' with marriage. She revealed, ""I do get (feelings of) a pregnancy for her next year.""  ""But actually, I don't think it's going to last. I'd probably give it five years. I feel there is a lot of personal things going on between them because they're two very strong individuals.""  She added, ""Which is a sad thing. I wish them all the best. But it doesn't look good."" The pair hasn't spent that much time together since they first started dating 18 months ago, so even they must not truly know how things will go. We'll just have to wait and see, but if the history of the Royal family is anything to by, this could be another rocky relationship.

"Carrie Fisher had cocaine, methadone, heroin and ecstasy in her system when she died in December, according to an autopsy report released Monday.  The coroner’s report listed sleep apnea as the primary cause of death, with drug intake as a contributing factor. The report stated that Fisher’s family objected to a full autopsy, and coroner’s investigators had access to limited toxicology specimens. The conclusions were based on toxicology results and an external examination of Fisher’s body.  Fisher died on Dec. 27, four days after going into cardiac arrest on an airplane arriving at LAX from London. The report states that Fisher’s assistant was on the plane with her. The assistant reported that she was awake and normal at the beginning of the flight, but had “multiple apneic episodes, which was her baseline” during the flight. At the end of the flight, she could not be awoken.  “Based on the available toxicological information, we cannot establish the significance of the multiple substances that were detected in Ms. Fisher’s blood and tissue, with regard to the cause of death,” the report states.  According to the report, Fisher may have ingested the cocaine as early as three days before the flight, adding to the uncertainty about the cause of death. The report also notes a likely exposure to heroin, which could have suppressed her breathing as she went into cardiac arrest.  In addition to the illegal drugs, Fisher was also taking Prozac, Abilify and Lamictal under prescription. She was also taking oxycodone without a prescription.  The report also notes that Fisher had a history of bipolar disorder and a long history of drug use.  Carrie Fisher Autopsy Report by gmaddaus on Scribd",1

"Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day. May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  In case you need a reminder of the striking Givenchy design Markle wore earlier in the day, here it is in all its royal-wedding glory:  Getty Images  Anyway, here's hoping the newlywed couple has a happy reception party at Frogmore House, the name of which I cannot stop saying in my head.  Be sure to follow along with all our royal wedding coverage for more details of this historic day.

"The pair gleefully rocked up to early press interviews hand-in-hand and waxed lyrical about one another.  An HBO source confirmed that during filming the duo were 'inseparable on the set.'  'The two of them were always joking around and having fun together.'  However over time this friendship has eroded. Once the show went to air in February, the pair’s relationship started to become competitive.  A source told LIFE & STYLE that things turned from that point onwards.  'The success of Big Little Lies has gone to both of their heads and there’s now a power struggle between the two stars,' the source revealed.  'Behind closed doors, their egos are clashing and they bicker over the smallest thing.'  The public were given a glimpse into the ongoing feud at the Emmy Awards in September when Big Little Lies won the Outstanding Limited Series category.  On stage, Reese grabbed the statue and refused to let it go – even when Nicole tried to have a turn holding it.  Tensions were further fuelled after Nicole beat out Reese for the Emmy award in the category of Best Actress In A Limited Series.  'There seemed to be some tension between Nicole and Reese at the Emmys afterparty,’ says the Insider.  'There were some icy stares back and forth, kind of checking who was getting most of the attention, which was clearly Nicole.'  For now the stars are continuing to play nice for the cameras when fulfilling their publicity duties. But the insider says this is all just for show.  'The bottom line is that Nicole and Reese really don’t like each other.'",0
"NBC anchor Megyn Kelly opened the top of her show on Today Wednesday by addressing the termination of her colleague Matt Lauer for sexual misconduct allegations, acknowledging the shock of the announcement but highlighting the bravery of those who came forward.  Before Kelly spoke about her personal experience with Lauer, she read the official statement from the network and showed the comments from Lauer’s former co-host Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, who was hosting in place of Lauer on Wednesday.  “This one does hit close to home,” Kelly said, referring to Lauer’s firing. “I too have known Matt for a long time, and he has been a friend, and kind and supportive to me in my transition to NBC News and I see the anguish on my colleague’s faces.”  “But when this happens,” Kelly continued, “What we don’t see is the pain on the faces of the women who found the courage to come forward. And it is a terrifying thing to do. We don’t see the career opportunities women lose because of sexual harassment or the intense stress it causes a woman dealing with it when she comes to work each day. I am thinking of those women this morning and hoping they are okay. The days to come will not be easy.”  NBC News announced Wednesday morning that Lauer, who had anchored the Today Show for more than two decades, had been fired following accusations of sexual misconduct. “While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he’s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,” NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in a statement.  Kelly, who was at Fox when sexual harassment allegations against now deceased chairman Roger Ailes emerged, said she is confident NBC will weather the storm.  “The good [news organizations] stay standing and forge forward, fulfilling their core mission: Journalism,” she said.",0
"Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree-lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home. Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate-chip cookies and a bowl of M&Ms.  The world’s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit-down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind-the-scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill.  “I don’t do a lot of media. I don’t want to be seen everywhere,” the 68-year-old Jenner says on a recent afternoon, her bare feet up on a lounge chair. “Today, I’m very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don’t stick my nose into everything publicly.”  Jenner’s low-key lifestyle and muted public profile stand in sharp contrast to the days when her much-talked-about 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer, in which she revealed plans to transition from a man to a woman, attracted a staggering 17 million viewers. Next came the cover of Vanity Fair and her own reality TV show, “I Am Cait.”  Her newfound fame put enormous pressure on Jenner — who had lived the first 65 years of her life as Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner — to be the perfect transgender role model. She had difficulty living up to those expectations, especially after coming out as something more controversial than being transgender: a Republican in Hollywood. On her reality show, Jenner expressed support for Ted Cruz and sparred with activists, who were as experienced in trans-politics as she was unversed. She voted for Trump in the 2016 election (but is no longer a fan).  Her conservatism made her a pariah in the left-leaning entertainment industry, where she’s been criticized for not doing enough to help the transgender community. Jenner spoke candidly with Variety about the pain of that rejection.  “No matter what you say or do, they think you don’t get it because you’re this kind of white, privileged person,” says Jenner. She disputes the notion that she hasn’t worked hard, or that her wealth disqualifies her from being an advocate. “I haven’t turned my back on anybody,” she says. But Jenner has received a cold shoulder from some of her peers: “I’ve felt it big time, and it hurts. Sometimes this community can be really tough.”  Jenner, who briefly considered running for senator, decided she could be more useful fighting for trans rights as a Republican liaison on Capitol Hill. She likens the civil rights battle to what the gay community faced 40 years ago on the road to marriage equality.  Every few weeks, Jenner travels to Washington to tell her story. She’s held long meetings with members of Trump’s White House and roughly 50 members of the House and Senate — to personally make the case for equality.  She’s patiently endured invasive questions about her body and genitalia, all in an effort to change people’s minds.  She says that these meetings are conducted away from the cameras. “I met with Paul Ryan,” she says. “I’ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren’t supportive of transgender rights.” What do they say to her? “I’ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,” says Jenner, who did not want to elaborate on conversations that were confidential.  Margaret Hoover, the president of the American Unity Fund, a Republican-funded group that advocates for LGBTQ rights, says that Jenner is uniquely positioned to educate. “Think of your average Republican in Washington,” Hoover says, noting that the party is getting older and less diverse. “It’s basically like every white friend of your 70-year-old dad. At the 1976 Olympic Games, they were all in the prime of their life, and Bruce Jenner was their hero. They idolized Bruce.” As a result, Jenner has been an effective ambassador. When they hear the word “transgender,” they might imagine a man in a dress. But when they see Caitlyn, they agree that she should use the women’s bathroom.  Jenner was originally hopeful about Trump, given that he promised to make LGBTQ rights part of his platform. But since taking office, he’s stoked fears by rolling back protections in schools and vowing to ban transgender people from the military. Jenner says her message to Trump, whom she met during the campaign but hasn’t spoken with as president, is simple. “Get over it! I honestly don’t know what happened when he got in there. It was extraordinarily disappointing,” she says.  In February 2017, Jenner lashed out against Trump on Twitter for withdrawing federal guidelines that allowed transgender youths to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. “From one Republican to another, this is a disaster,” she tweeted. “You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.”  Jenner says Trump never reached out. (A source with knowledge of her thinking says Jenner would like to meet with the president after the midterm elections, but not in front of the press.) “He’s not been doing a very good job, but it’s not over yet,” she says.  Jenner believes that the United States should pass a law that allows transgender citizens to enlist in the armed forces. “We need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality,” she says, pointing to measures passed by other countries, from Israel to England. “It’s going to take some time, but we’re working on it.”  Jenner wants everyone to know that she’s found happiness. “My life is so simple,” she says. “It’s just to be myself all day. I think people think when you transition, it is this tremendous thing, and now you’re a totally different person. I’m still the same person. Caitlyn lived inside me all my life.”  As a member of America’s most notorious reality TV family (“Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” for those of you living under a rock), Jenner gets asked to be photographed a lot in public. “If I’m out, I take a minimum of 30 selfies with people,” she says. “It drives everyone around me crazy.” This isn’t done out of vanity. She’s trying to prove a point. “That may be the first time they’ve met anybody who’s trans,” Jenner says about her interactions with her fans. “I want that to be a pleasurable experience. I want to be nice to people. I want to have a smile on my face. And they walk away and say, ‘Oh, my God! Caitlyn was so nice.’ That’s the way I want them to think of trans people. That we’re nice.”  CREDIT: victoria stevens for Variety  She’s disappointed that “I Am Cait” got canceled in 2016. “I wish we could’ve done more,” she says. She regrets talking about politics on the show. “Reality TV loves drama.” She’s certainly dealt with her share of that. The tabloids are reporting that she’s dating a 22-year-old transgender woman named Sophia Hutchins, whom she took to the ESPYs a few weeks ago. Hutchins is at her house on the day of our interview, and she follows us into Jenner’s office to listen to our conversation. Although they sound like a couple — Jenner asks Hutchins for the name of the last great movie they saw together (Hutchins suggests “I, Tonya”) — they deny that they are. “We are not going to get into that,” Jenner says. “But we are very close. We do a lot of things together. We’re kind of inseparable. We’re the best of friends.”  Regardless of the nature of their personal relationship, Hutchins is the executive director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation, which was formed last year to advance transgender rights. Jenner auctioned off a Porsche that she owned to raise funds. But her efforts there, too, have been kept under the radar. “Coming from a reality show, where every detail of your life is documented, to not seeking any press is kind of a big change,” Hutchins says. “Caitlyn is not working on these issues for press attention. She’s doing it because she genuinely wants to help the community.”  Jenner hasn’t found it easy to parse the PC rules of transgender politics. For example, she talks about how much she loved “The Danish Girl,” the 2015 biopic starring cisgender actor Eddie Redmayne as the artist Lili Elbe. “I thought it was good to have it out there,” Jenner says. “GLAAD talked to me and said, ‘Don’t mention you even saw the movie!’ And then all the flak came down about Eddie Redmayne doing it. I went to the Vanity Fair Oscar party, and I’m thinking, ‘What if he’s there? I can’t even be seen with him.’ That’s horrible!”  (“GLAAD shared concerns that transgender community members voiced about the film as a courtesy so that Caitlyn would be aware of them,” said a GLAAD rep.)  Before transitioning, she once auditioned for “Superman” and co-starred on TV’s “CHiPs.” She’s open to acting again. She says she’s working on something that would employ an all-transgender cast and crew. “You have to wait and see,” says Jenner, declining to give specifics. She reveals that her fantasy role would be as a comic-book villainess. “In a Marvel movie, I want to play the baddest-ass lady you’ve ever seen in your life. They got the wicked queen or the wicked lady. Just do the makeup and the outfit. And I got the deep voice.”  Jenner, whose autobiography, “The Secrets of My Life,” was published in 2017, sees her 10 kids as often as she can. She concedes that some of them are closer to her than others. She beams at Kylie being on the cover of Forbes as the youngest “self-made” almost billionaire. Although she didn’t attend her son Brody’s June wedding in Indonesia, she’ll see him soon. She’s supportive of her stepdaughter Kim’s recent visit with Trump, in which she convinced him to commute the sentence of a woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. “I thought they did the right thing,” Jenner says. “I was very proud of her.” As for her ex-wife Kris, they aren’t as friendly. “We haven’t talked in a long time.”  Jenner could see herself doing another reality TV show — maybe one where she parachutes into parts of the world as a transgender rights explorer. She doesn’t think she’ll appear in future episodes of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” “At this point, no,” she says. “But you never know.”  Watch more from Variety‘s interview with Caitlyn Jenner below.",0

"(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, which aired Tuesday.)  While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans Tuesday, the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, called “The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,” finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale’s shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the “her” is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit.  The answer: Randall’s mother, Rebecca Pearson (played by Mandy Moore).  Yes, just as “This Is Us” wrapped up the first half of its third season tonight, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall and his adult daughter — along with Toby and now Beth — are going to see “Randall’s mother,” as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she’s running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Midseason Finale Reveals Nicky's Fate - And It's Probably Not What You Were Expecting  Though this “her” revelation didn’t come until the episode’s closing moments — which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack’s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War — we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.  The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won’t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.  That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Melanie Liburd Is 'Really Excited' for Beth-Centric Episode - and What It Means for Zoe's Backstory (Video)  Because fans now have to wait until midseason to find out more about the future — and present — TheWrap has rounded up all the facts we’ve previously gathered about “This Is Us”s now-not-so-mysterious character, so you can theorize over the next piece of the puzzle — what are the circumstances surrounding this foreboding reunion? — for the next couple months.  See below for everything we knew — before tonight — about “her.”  Also Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers  She’s close to Tess, Randall and Toby  In the third season premiere, the final scene gives a few more clues as to who the unnamed woman might be. Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he’s “coming down.” Toby says he doesn’t know, but Randall tells him the “she” would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed — alone — which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes!  “You thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate — I would say that’s open to interpretation,” co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show’s Season 3 finally in September.  Alright, now we know it’s not Kate, but “Randall’s mother” — a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting For  “Toby is part of our family now,” Brown said. “So anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That’s my brother.”  Tess hasn’t seen “her” in awhile  Back on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. “It’s time to go see her, Tess,” Randall says. Tess responds that she’s “not ready,” and Randall says he’s not either.  The scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights.  Brown also told TheWrap that there’s a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see “her” — which of course we’ll find out in due time.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date  “There’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,” Brown said. “Yes, there’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn’t seen the ‘her’ for some time. And so there’s a reason why it’s time to go and she’s like, ‘I can’t.’ There’s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.”  This is as far in the future as we’ll go  “This future timeline is sort of the furthest that we’ll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,” Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about.  “I don’t imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,” Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. “But we may have other past timelines we’re going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'  “Well we’re going to give answers in that timeline, but it doesn’t mean it’s a timeline we can’t revisit and sort of push the story forward in that timeline,” co-showrunner Elizabeth Berger told TheWrap. “We’re going to give a lot of satisfying answers regarding that timeline this season — so they’re quickly in store.”  Answers were promised to be coming soon  “I think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,” Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. “The story is not about where it ends up, it’s about how you kind of get there… we’re not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.”  Moore said Fogelman has, “talked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues  “I think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,” Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. “It’s not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it’s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan’s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we’re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.”  Brown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.  “It is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won’t be something that comes out of nowhere,” Brown said. “Dan has already spoken to the fact that we’ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that’s dealing with that particular ‘her’ as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.”  “This Is Us” Season 3 will return Jan. 15 on NBC.",1

"Meanwhile, he didn't exactly take the news that Kourtney had a boyfriend well. ""I get a little jealous,"" he admitted early on. And as recently as February he was ""still insanely jealous,"" a source told E! News—though, having started dating Richie last September, he doesn't have any more legs to stand on there.  Kris Jenner, who has tirelessly embraced Scott as if he were one of her own kids, noticed right away that he was having issues with Kourtney's new relationship, especially after he put on a robe and got in bed during a trip to Williams Sonoma with her.  ""The situation is extremely hard and complicated, but I do have my own priorities and things that I need to focus on. He's just not my biggest concern anymore,"" Kourtney mused after telling her mom to ask Scott herself if she was so worried about him.

But it took literally years before anyone, Kourtney included, knew what was really going on with her and Scott, since the two of them still went on cozy-looking trips and spent as much time with the kids together as possible.

The ""Wolves"" singer debuted a platinum blonde hairstyle on Sunday night, pairing the look with a rocking black leather mini dress, and fans on Twitter have a lot of opinions.  Gomez will perform for the first time in over a year during the award show, her first performance since her kidney transplant earlier this year.  While most fans agree that she looks hotter than ever, the look has also drawn comparisons to on-again boyfriend Justin Bieber.

"Halftime shows are a tradition during American football games at all levels of competition. Entertainment during the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), represents a fundamental link to pop culture, which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest. As the Super Bowl itself is typically the most-watched event on television in the United States annually, the halftime show has been equally-viewed in recent years: the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIX featuring Katy Perry was viewed by 118.5 million, as part of an overall telecast that peaked at 120.3 million at its conclusion—the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. history.[1][2][3] The NFL claims that the Super Bowl LI halftime show, with Lady Gaga was the ""most-watched musical event of all-time,"" citing a figure of 150 million viewers based on the television audience, as well as unique viewership of video postings of the halftime show on the league's platforms, and social media interactions (a metric that was never calculated prior to 2017).[4][5] However, the show was seen by 117.5 million television viewers, making it the second-highest-rated halftime show.[6]  Prior to the early 1990s, the halftime show was based around a theme, and featured university marching bands (the Grambling State University Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to the 1990s), drill teams, and other performance ensembles such as Up with People. Beginning in 1991, the halftime show began to feature pop music acts such as New Kids on the Block and Gloria Estefan. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, Super Bowl XXVII featured a headlining performance by Michael Jackson. After Super Bowl XXXVIII, whose halftime show featured an incident where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts, the halftime show began to feature classic rock acts until the return of headlining pop musicians in 2011.  Background [ edit ]  During most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college marching band. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring drill teams and other performance ensembles; the group Up with People produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to counterprogram the game,[7] saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block, Gloria Estefan, Michael Jackson, Clint Black, Patti LaBelle, and Tony Bennett. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme—begun with Super Bowl III—ended, replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts in an alleged ""wardrobe malfunction"", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These shows were considered ""family friendly"" and the time in which they took place has been described as ""the age of reactionary halftime shows.[8] Since Super Bowl XLV, the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.  The NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends.[9] Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation.[10][11][12][11] According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure.[13] For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the Journal, received a ""chilly"" response from those involved.[14][15]  History [ edit ]  The following is a list of the performers, producers, themes, and sponsors for each Super Bowl game's show.  1960s [ edit ]  1970s [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  1990s [ edit ]  2000s [ edit ]  2010s [ edit ]  Details on specific shows [ edit ]  U2 performed 3 songs: ""Beautiful Day,"" ""MLK,"" and ""Where the Streets Have No Name."" During the beginning of ""MLK"" and continuing until the end of ""Where The Streets Have No Name,"" a large banner behind the band displayed the names of all the people who lost their lives on the September 11 attacks. Bono ended the song by opening up his jacket, the inside of which displayed the American flag.  For The Rolling Stones, the stage was in the form of the group's iconic tongue logo (John Pasche's ""Cunning Linguist"" first used in 1971 on their Sticky Fingers album). It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: ""Start Me Up,"" ""Rough Justice,"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."" The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined.[54] In the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, ABC and the NFL imposed a five-second delay and censored lyrics considered too sexually explicit in the first two songs by briefly turning off Mick Jagger's microphone—censoring to which the group had previously agreed.[55] However, the choice of The Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the traditional Detroit ""Motown Sound,"" and no artists from the area were included.[56]  See also [ edit ]",0
"Zoila Chavez has spent 18 years working for house-flipper extraordinaire and design guru Jeff Lewis — putting up with his hot temper and goofy antics on Bravo’s Flipping Out.  But after nearly two decades as Lewis’ housekeeper, the 68-year-old reality star has finally retired.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It’s been kind of rough,” Lewis told PEOPLE in a phone interview on Thursday. “I’m happy for her new life, but of course we were sad over here and we miss her.”  Kelsey McNeal/Bravo/Getty  If Chavez’s absence is felt even more right now, it’s because there’s a lot going on in the Lewis household. Not only are the reality star’s house-flipping and design businesses thriving, but he and his partner of eight years Gage Edward are also busy raising their 9-month old daughter, Monroe Christine.  Lewis explains: “Zoila retired about three months ago. She stayed the first six months we had the baby, which is amazing. You know, she’s wanted to retire for two years now, and she’s been with me for 18 years. I just begged her, begged her, begged her — ‘Please stay. I need help with the baby. I need help with this transition.’ And she stayed as long as she could.”  “Physically, after doing that kind of work for all of these years, it really takes its toll,” Lewis continued. “She’s 68 years old. She looks 10 years younger, because I gave her all that plastic surgery. But she’s tired and she’s ready to go.”  He and Chavez have certainly had their ups and downs over Flipping Out‘s 10 seasons. Not afraid to push back from time to time, Chavez’s sassy and stubborn attitude often landed her on the receiving end of Lewis’ famously short temper. In a season 9 episode, she was almost fired after walking out and refusing to return right as Lewis was preparing to leave for an important business trip.  “You better think real carefully about what you’re doing right now because there’ll be no going back,” Lewis warned her in a tense voicemail. “And I promise you—there’ll be no going back.”  Of course, the duo made up and Chavez is back in the Lewis household for season 10, working part-time two days a week. Viewers will get to see her road to retirement throughout the milestone season.  So what exactly has Chavez been doing since leaving? “Most of her family is in Nicaragua, so the first thing she did when she retired is she went to Nicaragua for five, six weeks,” Lewis explained. “Now she’s back and we’re texting — she has a daughter who lives in Koreatown, so she’s staying with her.”  RELATED VIDEO: Jeff Lewis Introduces His New Intern: His Daughter Monroe!  And in case there was any doubt, Lewis was quick to stress that Chavez is not out of his life — though Flipping Out viewers might see a whole new life for Lewis this season.  “When the baby came, everything changed. Everything changed. Our home life, our business life — everything has been shaken up in a good way,” he said. “It forces you to kind of grow and assess what’s working in your life and what’s not working in your life. Also, it’s not about my life anymore, it’s about the baby’s life. All these decisions we make are about what’s good for the baby. And I’m used to making decisions about what’s good for Jeff. So it’s kind of a new life.”  Flipping Out‘s 10th season premieres Aug. 17 (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.",1
"If, on Wednesday morning, you had risen early enough and rejoined the torrid, infinite march that is Twitter, you might have first learned of NBC’s termination of its morning-news lodestar, Matt Lauer, through neutral channels. At 6:52 A.M., the Times’s media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, tweeted, “BREAK: NBC Matt Lauer fired, inappropriate workplace behavior . . . story to come.” But, at 7 A.M., the “Today in New York” warmup ended, the friendly corporate bells chimed, and the “Today” show, as it has since 1952, started. The minutes in between were a chasm.  Stills of Lauer—bespectacled and reviewing notes in one, professorially inquisitive in another—crossed the screen as the voice of his co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, announced the breaking news that Lauer’s employment had been terminated overnight, after an employee had come forward on Monday “reporting behavior in violation of our company’s standards.” Guthrie’s voice trembled as the camera captured the tableau—Guthrie and her guest co-anchor, Hoda Kotb, palpably sombre, the Popsicle-orange “Today” show logo floating between them. Guthrie clasped Kotb’s hand. She read the entirety of a statement from the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, which was composed in the corporate “we”: “we” had reason to believe that the employee’s complaint wasn’t an isolated incident; “we were deeply saddened by this turn of events”; “we will face it together as a news organization—and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.” Then Guthrie and Kotb offered their personal expressions of shock and dismay. Lauer had been loved by so many; “we” loved him. “As I’m sure you can imagine, we are devastated,” Guthrie said. “We’re trying to process it and make sense of it, and it’ll take some time for that,” Kotb said. Expressions of disorientation not dissimilar from expressions of mourning continued for the rest of the show. As Rebecca Traister wrote earlier this month, a “powerful white man losing a job is a death.”  We have witnessed a theatre of accountability insidiously refine itself, quite quickly, in the past few months. Louis C.K.’s statement, for example, following the exposé in the Times of his sexual harassment of female comics, was not as passionate as, but was more coherent than, Harvey Weinstein’s ramblings about Jay-Z and the gun lobby. The opportunistic finesse of Kevin Spacey’s coming-out certainly tripped some social alarms, but he nonetheless garnered some sympathy. Power brokers like the Pixar animation baron John Lasseter have even scooped long-labored-over articles by preëmpting them altogether. (Lasseter is taking a six-month leave of absence.) No display was savvier than NBC’s orchestration on Wednesday.  The “Today” show’s artful transposition of grief where there would naturally be scrutiny continued into the 10 A.M. slot, in which the veteran host Kathie Lee Gifford spoke of how much she, too, loved Lauer and how sad she was. It continued on this morning’s program, with Guthrie and Kotb again at the helm. Not since Bill Cosby—or Bill O’Reilly, depending on one’s television diet—has the scourge of sexual assault so acutely infiltrated the righteous perimeter of the American home. (President Trump, also affiliated with NBC and accused of assaulting women, never quite depended on a family-man image.) The influence of a behind-the-scenes figure like Weinstein can feel diffuse, removed from our everyday cultural consumption; Lauer was, and is, synonymous with the family feel of “Today.” Part of this comes from the network’s bloated investment in Lauer—he reportedly earns between twenty million and twenty-five million dollars a year. (In 2014, a source told Page Six that the company chartered helicopter rides for Lauer from his Hamptons compound to its Rockefeller Center studios at his request.) When, in 1996, Lauer wrested the anchor chair from Bryant Gumbel, gossip magazines swooned over his geometric jaw and feathery hair; twenty years later, he was transforming comfortably into a smug but wise paternal figure. His tenure at the “Today” show was the longest in its history. Now instances of Lauer’s public pettiness toward women seem like the exertions of a holistically awful campaign. In 2012, he admonished the actress Anne Hathaway for photographs that the paparazzi had taken of her exiting a car. “Seen a lot of you lately,” he said. And, famously, Lauer was an architect of “Operation Bambi,” a plan that succeeded in getting his former co-anchor Ann Curry fired from the show that same year. (“ ‘Chemistry,’ in television history, generally means the man does not want to work with the woman,” Curry said, according to Brian Stelter’s insider anatomy, “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.”) On her final show, Curry wept and Lauer pretended to soothe her. His interview of Hillary Clinton last year was intrusive and aggressive when compared with his handling of Trump. How a man thinks of women dictates how he works with them.  The stakes with Lauer, as with Charlie Rose, who was fired from both CBS and PBS last week, for sexual harassment, threaten the geniality and social integrity that are the trade of the morning-show apparatus. And so it is no surprise that, to convey something like moral mooring to a vastly female audience, the networks rely on women anchors to break the public fall. An ether of remorse already fogs the perception of Lauer’s ousting, though Lauer waited a day to issue a statement and in it said, “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.” It seems likely that, at least when it comes to the fact of Lauer’s firing, Guthrie had truly been caught off guard. The company, however, wasn’t; reporters at Variety and the Times had spent months investigating claims against Lauer. Guthrie’s vulnerable pose conferred an unearned armament to a company that had employed a reckless man for two decades. The woman anchor’s surprise becomes the network’s surprise; her sorrow, its sorrow. “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they behaved badly?” Guthrie asked, her eyes glassy. For her, and for Gayle King, who asked a similar question when reporting on her co-host Rose’s transgressions last week, on CBS, the question of loyalty may be relevant. (It was Lauer who lobbied for Guthrie’s co-anchorship, in 2012, following the success of “Operation Bambi.”) But neither love nor loyalty nor sadness excuses NBC, the company that passed on its own employee’s reportage of Weinstein’s abuse of women. The Variety report on Lauer, published on Wednesday afternoon, included accounts of harassment from three unnamed women. It showed an emboldened player whose harmful wiles were accommodated by the network around him. The news mediates the news.  One detail from Ramin Setoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister’s reporting in Variety mentions a contraption, apparently common in the offices of executives of his stature, that in this context sounds like something used by a villain from a Bond film. The installation of a button under Lauer’s desk made it possible for him to lock himself, and anyone else who might have been invited into his office, inside, without getting up from his seat. The Times reported that NBC on Wednesday had received at least two more complaints from employees about Lauer’s behavior. One woman told the Times that Lauer locked her in his office in 2001: “She said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her.” She passed out and was taken to a nurse by Lauer’s assistant. Reading the article, I wondered who had seen that commotion, and I thought about the lock, an instrument of security turned into an instrument of violence.",0

"[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]  XXXTentacion had been a rising star in hip-hop, landing a No. 1 album in March despite existing largely outside of the mainstream music business. He first gained popularity on the streaming platform SoundCloud and became something of a poster child for the digital age, with millions of young fans tracking his every utterance. But XXXTentacion was also mired in controversy and legal troubles, and was awaiting trial on charges including aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, false imprisonment and witness tampering at the time of his death.  Image Michael Boatwright was served an arrest warrant for first-degree murder in the killing of XXXTentacion. Credit Broward Sheriff's Office  On the day he was killed, the rapper visited Riva Motorsports with a friend. The police said two men followed XXXTentacion into the store and later, as he was leaving the dealership, blocked his vehicle and exited a dark-colored S.U.V. brandishing guns and demanding property. After a brief struggle, at least one of the suspects fired at the rapper, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital.  “The investigation continues,” the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said in its news release on Wednesday.  Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward said that his department was withholding additional information about the arrest of Mr. Boatwright, and sealed the arrest report, as it continued to pursue the case, the Sun-Sentinel reported.  “We’re not releasing any information about it because we’re still looking for two other suspects, including Robert Allen,” Mr. Israel said. “If we release more information about the case, it may hamper detectives’ ability or impede their progress to make those other arrests and take those two individuals into custody.”  Since XXXTentacion’s death, his music has surged on streaming platforms, sending both of his official albums into the Top 5 on the Billboard chart; the single “Sad!” also reached No. 1 last month. According to his associates, XXXTentacion had been close to finishing a new album, and had signed a $10 million deal for its release just weeks before he was killed.",1
"Prior to her hospitalization for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday, the singer had revealed she broke her sobriety in new single ""Sober.""  Demi Lovato was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday. Hours later, the pop star's representative confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that she was ""awake and with her family"" following the health scare.  ""Demi is awake and with her family, who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support,"" the statement read. ""Some of the information being reported is incorrect, and they respectfully ask for privacy and not speculation, as her health and recovery is the most important thing right now.""  Los Angeles police said, earlier on Tuesday, that they responded to a call at 11:39 a.m. to a home on the 8000 block of Laurel View Drive in the Hollywood Hills, where Lovato lives, for a female victim of a possible overdose. The 25-year-old was reportedly administered Narcan, which is used to treat narcotic overdoses in emergency situations.  The incident occurred just weeks after the former Disney Channel star and reformed addict wrote about breaking her sobriety in her latest track, ""Sober."" In the song, Lovato details her experience with withdrawals and the emotional aftermath of a relapse. The singer had been sober for six years.  ""Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore/ And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor,"" she sings. ""To the ones who never left me/ We've been down this road before/ I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore.""  Lovato posted a video of an early performance of the song on Twitter with the message, ""Tonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. It will never be forgotten.""  She most recently performed the song live at the California Mid-State Fair in Paso Robles on July 22. Lovato reportedly got emotional onstage and forgot some of the lyrics at the end of the song. ""Fuck, I forgot the words,"" Lovato said before walking offstage, an eyewitness recalled to Us Weekly, adding that the entertainer also ""had tears in her eyes.""  Years before the release of ""Sober,"" Lovato — who first checked in to rehab at the age of 18 in 2010 and then entered a sober house for approximately a year in 2013 — had been open about facing her demons. In 2011, Lovato was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of struggling with an eating disorder and self harm, in addition to her drug addiction.  During a 2013 interview with Access Hollywood, Lovato revealed the moment of reckoning she had at age 19. ""I was going to the airport and I had a Sprite bottle just filled with vodka, and it was just 9 in the morning. And I was throwing up in the car, and this was just to get on a plane to go back to L.A. to the sober living house that I was staying at,"" she recounted. ""I had all the help in the world, but I didn't want it.""  In 2015, Lovato — who co-owns the L.A. treatment facility CAST Centers — explained to Women's Health why she decided to speak openly about her experience in rehab and become a mental health advocate. According to the Camp Rock actress, she had hoped her honesty would help others going through similar situations.  ""I remember sitting with my manager and my family and talking to them about whether or not to speak out about the issues that I was dealing with,"" she said about using her platform to raise awareness. ""I knew that there were two options: I could either not talk about my stint in rehab and hope that it went away, or I could talk about it and inspire people to get help for their issues, as well, so that's exactly what I did.""  She also discussed her diagnosis and the work she has put in to maintain a healthy mind: ""For years, people said I was depressed, and I actually didn't know myself why I was so upset and why I would have these episodes of mania — what I now know is mania.""  While appearing on the U.K.'s The Jonathan Ross Show in 2017, the ""Sorry Not Sorry"" singer said that her parents' tough love had helped her stay on track in recent years. ""I knew that I had a lot of life ahead of me, but one of the main reasons of getting sober was so that I could be around my little sister because my mom and dad [said I couldn't be around her] if I was doing stuff,"" she said, adding that she was also thankful for the support from her fans and inner circle.  ""I had family and really close friends and my manager — they all were by my side through everything,"" Lovato continued. ""I wouldn't be here without them. My fans too. I feel they gave me a reason to live and I'm forever grateful.""  Last year, the Grammy nominee was the recipient of the Spirit of Sobriety Award at the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular. In her acceptance speech, Lovato admitted that ""every day is a battle.""  ""You just have to take it one day at a time; some days are easier than others and some days you forget about drinking and using, but for me, I work on my physical health, which is important, but my mental health as well,"" she said. ""I make sure I stay on my medications. I go to AA meetings. I do what I can physically in the gym. I make it a priority.""  In her 2017 documentary, Simply Complicated, Lovato offered insight into her initial attraction to drugs and alcohol. ""I felt out of control the first time I did it,"" she said. ""My dad was an addict and an alcoholic. Guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol, because it fulfilled him, and he chose that over a family.""  Elsewhere in the film, Lovato said that she ""wasn't ready to get sober"" during her first rehab stint as a teen: ""I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night.""  In the wake of her apparent overdose on Tuesday, a multitude of stars — including Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande — have taken to Twitter to express their well wishes for Lovato and have urged the public to be kind as she recovers.  ""We should all wrap our arms of love around Demi Lovato. I am so happy you're alive. Thank God,"" wrote Gaga. ""If I know my monsters as well as I believe I do, we all wish you self-compassion and inner peace. And may you receive the love so many have for you. #ImConfidentinDemi Demi, I love you.""",1
"Felicity Jones married her movie director boyfriend of three years Charles Guard on Saturday.  The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England, with the star opting to wear a 'budget' dress.  The couple's big day celebration had an impressive guest list, with A-list celebs including the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61.  Finally hitched: Felicity Jones, 34, married her boyfriend of three years Charles Guard, 45, on Saturday in their native England in a secret ceremony (pictured in 2017)  According to The Sun, the bride wore an elegant full-sleeved white gown with sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck.  Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.  The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives.  It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding.  The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago.  Historic: The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives  Special day: It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding  Spellbinding venue: It is being said that Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony  The movie director popped the question in May 2017 after just two years of dating.  He is best known for the 2009 horror film The Uninvited, which he co-directed with his brother, Thomas Guard.

The British beauty admitted that when she was invited to the British Academy Film & Television Awards for the first time shortly after winning a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her work in indie movie Like Crazy, she was totally unprepared for the glamorous event.

"While the terms ""natural"" and ""organic"" aren't FDA-regulated when it comes to sunscreen, Dr. Joshua Zeichner, a board-certified dermatologist, says most experts agree that natural and organic formulas should come from natural, sustainably-sourced ingredients that are also free of fragrances, dyes, sulfates, parabens, and phthalates. But just because an SPF's label reads ""natural"" or ""organic,"" doesn't mean it's chemical-free, adds board-certified dermatologist Shereene Idriss, M.D. ""So when looking for a 'natural' or 'organic' sunscreen, look for products that are labeled mineral or physical, since they typically contain purely titanium oxide or zinc.""

"There was 'one last chapter to tell' in the Sex and the City saga, Sarah Jessica Parker said. And this dream of die-hard fans desperate for a third film to redeem the widely panned sequel almost came true in 2014. Then one of the leading actresses dropped out of the production.  But it wasn't Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis or Cynthia Nixon.  Court documents obtained by the DailyMail.com reveal the production fell apart when Michelle Pfeiffer, who never appeared in the six seasons of the HBO show or the two films, decided to opt out of the movie.  Scroll down for video  Filming for Sex and the City 3 was set to take place in New York City in 2014, but then one of the project's 'leading actresses' Michelle Pfeiffer, 59, dropped out of the film. She never appeared on the 6 seasons of the HBO show or the two films  Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall starred in the first and second Sex and the City films which together grossed more than $700million worldwide  Sex and the City executive producer Cindy Chupack filed suit over a Greenwich Village townhouse in 2014.  The house on East Ninth Street is only a few blocks away from the facade of Carrie Bradshaw's iconic apartment on Perry Street in West Village.  Sex and the City producer Cindy Chupack (pictured) said production on the film halted when Michelle Pfeiffer dropped out  Chupack, who has also produced episodes of Modern Family and Divorce, explained in the court documents she put down a $15,000 deposit to rent a home owned by Rebecca Flores.  The producer attempted to cancel the booking the next day after 'one of the lead actresses for the movie, Michelle Pfeiffer' opted out of the film.  Documents state there was no replacement lined up for the 'Scarface' actress.  By the time Chupack asked for her money back, Flores had already cashed the check and refused to refund her.  Chupack sued for $28,500 in damages and Flores fired back, counter-suing for $100,000.  Like Carrie and Mr Big's on-again, off-again relationship, the legal battle dragged on for years until the judge came back with an decision in May.  The order states, 'As a backdrop, plaintiff, a noted screenwriter and movie producer, sought to rent an apartment in Manhattan for three months so she can work on the movie, Sex and the City, that was to be filmed in New York City.  'Plaintiff expressed her interest in renting the apartment listed for $20,000 per month for a three month period, and remitted a non refundable hold fee of $15,000. The filming of the movie did not commence as planned.'  The townhouse is located on East Ninth Street and is just a few blocks away from the home used for the facade of Carrie Bradshaw's apartment on Perry Street  Earlier this month, the judge threw out the producer's lawsuit entirely stating it was not the defendant's fault the movie was cancelled and the contract was clear about the deposit.  It ordered Chupack's husband, plaintiff and attorney Ian Wallach to pay $5,000 on the defendant's first counterclaim in damages and another $5,000 in sanctions.  The court filings detail email communication between the producer and renter which show in early January she wrote to Flores saying she would know if the film was for sure going to happen by February 8.  Though Pfeiffer never starred on Sex and the City during its six season run, she did appear in the fim New Year's Eve in 2011 with Sarah Jessica Parker. The actresses also both have starring roles in HBO shows, Parker in Divorce and Pfeiffer in the upcoming film The Wizard of Lies.  Filming for Sex and the City Three was supposed to start in 2014. Since then, Sarah Jessica Parker has hinted several times another film could be in the works  The pair recently taped an episode of Variety Studio: Actors on Actors where they interviewed each other.  The first Sex and the City movie was released in 2008, and grossed a whopping $415 million at the box office worldwide. The sequel, which was primarily set in Abu Dhabi, generated $288 million worldwide.  Fans have been speculating about a third film for years, emboldened by Sarah Jessica Parker's hints.  In January 2014, she told InStyle magazine, 'A part of me thinks there is one last chapter to tell.'  In 2015 she posted a teasing Instagram of her leaving Bloomingdale's dressed in designer clothes.  Fans couldn't help but wonder, why would Sarah Jessica Parker keep hinting there would be a Sex and the City movie if there wasn't a possibility of another film?  She captioned the photo: 'Well. I guess the cat's out of the (little brown) bag. As usual, we will keep you posted on every detail as we are able. I'm under a strict gag order until then.'  In 2016 while promoting her new show Divorce, SJP reiterated the line about another chapter, 'I will say that the idea, it rests in the butler's pantry. Not on the table, but somebody is holding it fairly nearby.'  Much like her character Miranda, Cynthia Nixon was more pragmatic about her answer when she was asked by the Hollywood Reporter if there would be a third film in 2012.  She said: 'I think we had a wonderful ride. I think it's fine to let it go.'",0
"Brad Pitt is 'absolutely smitten by' Neri Oxman, the acclaimed architect and MIT professor who he's been linked with last fall, as 'their chemistry is off the charts.'  The 54-year-old actor and 42-year-old award-winning academic 'got romantically involved almost right away' after they initially crossed paths when he took in a presentation of 3D-printed chaise lounges she produced, a source told US.  The Oklahoma-born star and Oxman, who was born in Haifa, Israel appears to be Pitt's first major relationship since parting ways with Angelina Jolie in the fall of 2016.  Scroll below for video  Strong start: Brad Pitt, 54, is 'absolutely smitten by' Neri Oxman, 42, (R), the architect and MIT professor who he's been linked with last autumn  And the Fight Club star has fought hard to avoid the unending media attention he endured in his previous relationship with the mother of his six kids - Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine - Jolie.  'He’s been going to great length to make sure he’s not spotted by prying eyes,' the source told the publication, noting that it hasn't kept them from enjoying the world in their newfound romance.  The Seven star and Oxman 'have traveled together internationally on several occasions,' including February's Design Indaba conference in South Africa, where Oxman delivered a speech, the source said. 'They are very much a couple,' said a source.  A separate source told the publication that Pitt's relationship with Oxman 'is solely a professional' one.  Out and about: Oxman was snapped in Italy last year for Milan Design Week with Luigi Luca (L)  Taking things slow: 'Their friendship has not turned into romance … as both are cautious and this is, again, more of a professional friendship' a source told Page Six of Pitt and Oxman's relationship  Pitt was snapped visiting the media lab where she works in a duo of posts from November 28, 2017 on Instagram. A previously unseen image of the star saw him posing with the academic in a group image - the second of him seen at the location.  The War Machine star was also snapped posing with six women when he visited Oxman at the educational institution, in a shot student Kathy Camenzind uploaded to her Instagram post with the caption: 'Ocean’s six? #whatjusthappened #bradpitt #medialab.' (Oxman, however, was not featured in the social media snap.)  In the shots, the Allied star wore an all-black ensemble of a hooded sweatshirt with pants and shoes, sporting a bit of stubble. He posed alongside Oxman in a shot that was subsequently removed from social media, according to People.  Group shot: Brad Pitt's relationship with acclaimed architect and MIT professor Neri Oxman seems to date back to last autumn, as the perennial A-lister, 54, was snapped visiting the media lab where Oxman works on November 28  Happy days: Brad also posed with other staff at the laboratory (Oxman not pictured)  Quick connection: 'Brad and Neri instantly hit it off because they share the same passion for architecture, design and art,' a source revealed  A colleague of Oxman described the academic architect as 'genius and gorgeous' to the magazine. Pitt was referred to Oxman to collaborate on an architectural project he was working on, Page Six reported last week.  'Brad and Neri instantly hit it off because they share the same passion for architecture, design and art,' a source told the outlet, 'This is best described as a professional friendship.'  The source added that the friendship hasn't blossomed into a romance just yet - but there is potential.  'Their friendship has not turned into romance … as both are cautious and this is, again, more of a professional friendship, but Brad is very interested in spending more time with Neri, she is fascinating,' the source said.  Talented: Oxman is also an artist with her works featured in collections at MoMA, Paris’ Centre Georges Pompidou, Vienna’s Museum of Applied Arts and Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts and Museum of Science. Pictured is her The Silk Pavilion installation  Acclaimed: Oxman was named in the list of 25 Most Stylish Bostonians in 2012 by The Boston Globe  Oxman is a professor at the MIT Media Lab, where she founded and directs the Mediated Matter group. She was previously married to Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov.  The beautiful brunette is also an artist with her works featured in collections at MoMA, Paris’s Centre Georges Pompidou, Vienna’s Museum of Applied Arts and Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts and Museum of Science.  Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston is said to be heartbroken again after reportedly being blindsided by news that ex-husband Brad, whom she was rumored to be getting back with following her recent separation, has a new girlfriend.  WHO IS NERI OXMAN? Who is the woman who finally helped Brad Pitt get over his ex Angelina Jolie? The matinee idol is said to be dating a brilliant and beautiful university professor named Neri Oxman. Oxman, an acclaimed MIT architect, appears to have a special blueprint for the emotional complexities of the enigmatic Hollywood star - at least enough working knowledge to capture his attention for the past six months. But until recently she was only known among elite academic and architectural circles before blazing a trail through social echelons normally reserved for only A-list stars. The 42-year-old American-Israeli has been romantically linked to Brad, 54, after they worked together on a project according to Page Six. Perfectly paired: Brad Pitt is said to have moved on from ex-wife Angelina Jolie with acclaimed MIT architect Neri Oxman Oxman, who is a leader at the MIT Media Lab, where she founded and directs the Mediated Matter group, was previously married to Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov. The beautiful brunette is also an artist with her works featured in collections at MoMA, Paris’ Centre Georges Pompidou, Vienna’s Museum of Applied Arts and Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts and Museum of Science. Her accolades are many as she was chosen as one of ICON’s 'top most influential designers and architects to shape our future' and Esquire’s 'best and brightest' in 2009. In 2014, Oxman was even named to Carnegie’s Pride of America. Background: She was born and raised in Haifa, Israel, to architect parents She was born and raised in Haifa, Israel, to her parents Robert and Rivka Oxman, who are both architects themselves. She has previously said she spent her youth straddling the worlds presented to her by her grandmother and her cosmopolitan and artistic parents. Neri has said her grandmother's garden represented nature for her while her parent's architectural studio was a special space where she immersed herself in culture. She moved to Jerusalem to Hebrew University's Hadassah Medical School in 1997 but within two years she had shifted her focus from medicine to architecture which took her to Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. She later attended the London Architectural Association School of Architecture and graduated in 2004. One year later she was in Boston to earn her PhD at MIT and by 2010 she was already an associate professor at the world renowned institution. Oman's ex-husband is a Grammy Award winning composer from Argentina named Osvaldo Golijov. She currently runs her own program at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where her team 'conducts research at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology' according to the university's website. 'Oxman coined the term, and pioneered the research area, of Material Ecology, which considers computation, fabrication, and the material itself as inseparable dimensions of design,' the description reads. Educated: Oxman later attended the London Architectural Association School of Architecture and graduated in 2004. One year later she was in Boston to earn her PhD at MIT  According to Hollywood Life, the 49-year-old actress and Brad reportedly began speaking again after she and Justin Theroux went public about their decision to end their marriage in February 2018.  An insider told Hollywood Life: 'Jen is crushed after hearing the rumors that Brad has been talking to a beautiful, Angelina Jolie lookalike, MIT professor. Jen had her hopes up of a possible reconciliation with Brad since she and her ex started talking again.  'When the both became recently single, Jen thought the timing couldn't be better, and she might have her fairy tale, happy ending with Brad after all. Jen never stopped loving him.'  Former flames: , Jennifer Aniston is said to be heartbroken again after reportedly being blindsided by news that ex-husband Brad has a new girlfriend  Star magazine previously reported that Jennifer and Brad 'have been secretly getting together for late-night hookups, and it's all because of George [Clooney].'  These reports come amid conflicting claims from other publications. After Jennifer and Justin's separation bombshell, some claimed that she and Brad hadn't spoken in years, while other said she leaned on him during her separation.  Jennifer, who is notoriously private about her love life, likely will not comment on the matter.  Split: Jennifer and Brad reportedly began speaking again after she and Justin Theroux went public about their decision to end their marriage in February 2018  Meanwhile Pitt heads up the Make It Right Foundation, which builds affordable, solar-powered homes and communities for people in need. The Troy star has been working with architects from all over the world to build homes in New Orleans - which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina - as well as neighborhoods in need in New Jersey and Kansas City, Missouri.  It comes as it was revealed that the Fight Club actor is expected to finalize his divorce from Angelina Jolie within weeks.  A new report, published last weekend, hints that proceedings are imminent, following news that both have moved on with new love interests.  'The terms of the divorce are now agreed,' a source informed The Sun on Sunday. 'They are being finalised by both legal teams, but will be filed within weeks.  'It’s a huge turnaround from where the marriage ended, especially given the claims Angelina made against Brad, but they are now on pretty good terms.  'Both decided it was crucial for the children that they had a respectful relationship.'  Brad and Angelina are parents to Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  Angelina, 42, is rumored to be dating a 'handsome and older looking' real estate agent. The stars split in September 2016 after two years of marriage and a nine-year romance prior to that.",0
"Whenever an awards show takes place in the midst of a charged political climate, it’s always the topical speeches that define the night.  This year’s Emmy Awards honored TV’s current politicized landscape, so naturally winners from The Crown’s John Lithgow to Master of None’s Lena Waithe embraced the opportunity to make a statement on Sunday night. The most common target was, unsurprisingly, the president, who has had a troubled relationship with celebrities and awards shows — including the Emmys. Some went hard against the Trump administration, while others skipped the takedowns, and instead highlighted causes and marginalized groups.  Here are all the moments when honorees and presenters got topical:  Stephen Colbert was right at home  The evening’s host had a prescription for those struggling with the tumultuous news cycle: watch TV! He opened the ceremony with the musical number “Everything Is Better on TV,” running through this year’s sizable roster of options for escapism with cameos from the likes of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Chance the Rapper. Of course there were digs about how House of Cards is beginning to feel like real life. The big finish: a battalion of Handmaid’s Tale showgirls topped off the spectacle.  Colbert even looked at the camera and addressed President Trump directly. “Hello sir. Thank you for joining us. Looking forward to the tweets,” he said. The hits only got more pointed from there.  “However you feel about the president, every show was influenced by Trump in some way. All the late night shows, obviously. House of Cards, the new season of American Horror Story, and of course next year’s Latin Grammys hosted by Sheriff Joe Arpaio.”  Predictably, Colbert made a meal out of Trump complaining about his failure to snag an Emmy for his reality TV series Celebrity Apprentice.  “If he had won an Emmy I bet he wouldn’t have run for president. So in a way, this was all your fault,” Colbert said. “I thought you people loved morally compromised anti-heroes. You loved Walter White. He’s just Walter much whiter.”  Colbert hit Trump’s “The Emmys are rigged” gripe hard by playing actual footage from the presidential debate when Trump peppered in his remark that “I should have gotten it,” while Hillary Clinton was attacking Trump about his Emmy snub complaints.  But Trump doesn’t have an Emmy, because as the host explained to huge applause, “Unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Sean Spicer rolled onstage  Colbert then segued into the cameo of the night. “Of course what really matters to Trump is ratings. You got to have the big numbers. We have no way of knowing how big our audience is. Sean, do you know?”  The audience lost it as Trump’s former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer came out to assess the crowd size. When asked about how many eyeballs were on the show, Spicer delivered: “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys period — both in person and around the world,” referencing his own controversial responses to contested reports about Trump’s inauguration crowd size.  Targets who weren’t Trump  Colbert also went after Senator Ted Cruz’s recent Twitter debacle. “Everyone loves streaming video. Just ask Ted Cruz,” he said, referencing the fact that Cruz’s Twitter account recently “liked” a tweet from a porn account. “But knock first. You don’t want to just walk in.”  It wasn’t all about politicians, though. Colbert also blasted Real Time host and Emmy nominee Bill Maher for his controversial use of the N-word.  John Lithgow nods to history  The Crown’s Lithgow praised his character Winston Churchill’s leadership in his supporting actor acceptance speech. “In these crazy times, his life reminds us what courage and leadership in government looks like.”  Saturday Night Live players address their political counterparts  A tearful Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton, the main subject of her own political satire on Saturday Night Live, for her “grace and grit.”  Alec Baldwin opened his acceptance speech, for his SNL performance as Trump, with a dig about POTUS: “At long last I suppose I should say, here, Mr. President, is your Emmy.”  9 to 5 Reunion  The cast of the 1980 movie 9 to 5 — Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda — used their platform as presenters to take a stab at Trump, too. “In 1980, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss,” Fonda opened. “And in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss,” Tomlin added.  Lena Waithe’s emotional speech  After a standing ovation, Master of None’s Lena Waithe accepted the award for Outstanding Writing of a Comedy Series with a message for her “LGBTQIA family:” “I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers — every day when you walk out the door and put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren’t in it. And for everybody out there that showed so much love for this episode, thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the South Side of Chicago.”  Donald Glover actually thanked POTUS in his second speech  Atlanta auteur Glover gave Trump a shout-out for activating him. “I wanna thank Trump for making black people the number one most oppressed group. He’s the reason I’m probably up here.”  Veep‘s political moment  Emmy darling Julia Louis-Dreyfus won for her leading role on Veep, the HBO comedy about incompetence in the White House, and included a reference to POTUS. “We did have a whole storyline about impeachment but we abandoned that because we were worried someone else might get to it first.”  Riz Ahmed gave his causes a powerful dose of publicity  When Ahmed won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie for The Night Of, he used his speech to drive home a point. “If this show has shone a light on some of the prejudice in our societies, Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, maybe that’s something. I will shout out South Asian Youth Action for helping me prepare for this, and the Innocence Project.”  Nicole Kidman propelled domestic violence to the top of the agenda  After winning an Emmy for her powerful portrayal of a domestic abuse survivor on Big Little Lies, Kidman closed her acceptance speech with a call to action. “We shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know, it is filled with shame and secrecy and by you acknowledging me with this award it shines a light on it even more.”",0
"Chris Rock reportedly upset a significant group of his fan base as he allegedly made comments joking about sexual harassment in one of his recent stand-up performances.  According to Page Six, during his performance at the Comedy Cellar, Rock explained that he refused to hire women because ""they cry rape because they want money.""  One patron who attended the gig spoke with the publication and added more context to the reports, saying that Rock joked that he would need a crew of witnesses surrounding him at all times to prevent him from falling victim to false rape allegations.  His comments didn't sit well with a few of his fans as another attendee added, ""I've seen him before and he was hysterical, but this wasn't funny at all... Nobody was laughing. There were many boos and many women who were telling him he was a sexist pig. Two people got kicked out.""

"(Spoilers ahead for the final season of Netflix’s “House of Cards”)  “House of Cards'” final season is here and now we know how the show wrote out Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood.  The short story is: He’s dead, which we’ve known for a while without knowing any other meaningful details. When the season begins, its mentioned that he died in his sleep and we see photos of Robin Wright’s Claire Underwood, now president, looking at her dead husband’s casket. But here’s what happened, as far as we know:  After Claire declined Frank’s phone call in the Oval Office (when Season 5 ended, she was supposed to pardon him for, well, all that stuff he did over the course of the series), she mentions to the camera it was the last time they spoke. Two months later, Frank storms into the White House, furious at Claire for not giving him the pardon she promises she would. Scared, Claire locked herself in her room and found Frank dead in his bed the next morning. She told the public they were both in that bed. And, privately, she believes he was murdered.  Also Read: Here's Everything Coming to and Leaving Netflix in November  An autopsy revealed he died from an overdose from his liver medication, which Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) claims is something he wouldn’t do by accident.  And, of course, it wasn’t an accident, though what exactly happened isn’t revealed until the very last scene of the series. It turned out that Frank was murdered by Doug, who mixed up the medication. Doug says that he killed Frank because Frank was going to murder Claire for not following through on her promise. As Doug explains it, “I had to protect the legacy from the man.”  The idea here throughout the season is that Doug Stamper is obsessed with protecting Frank’s reputation above all else. While everybody else is scheming nonstop and jockeying for power, Doug is constantly switching sides as he tries to figure out which side will actually prevent Frank’s name from being dragged through the mud.  Also Read: 'Sabrina': Biggest Differences Between Netflix Series' Premiere and Comics Issue #1  And he murdered Frank for exactly that reason. If Frank were to murder Claire there’s almost no way he would have been able to get away with it, and would thus would be remembered almost entirely for having done that. So Doug had to kill him.  Spacey was fired from the Netflix series last December, following multiple accusations of sexual assault. Netflix also dropped Spacey’s film “Gore,” on famous writer Gore Vidal, in the wake of the accusations. Though he’s obviously never seen — even the photos of Clair looking at his casket don’t show his face, and Frank made audio diaries that are mentioned often but never heard — Frank Underwood’s presence as the show’s lead for the first five seasons is felt throughout the final season.  In fact, much of what Claire has to deal with as president is weathering the fallout from all the political deals Frank made while president. This is especially apparent with the Shepherds (Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane), who serve as the season’s main antagonists after Claire won’t honor deals they made with Frank.  The sixth and final season of “House of Cards” is now available on Netflix.",1
"Before he equivocated about a white supremacist murder, before he threatened war with North Korea, before he advocated a Muslim ban, before he drove a big truck, Donald Trump had more quotidian concerns bouncing back and forth across his tiny little brain. It was an apocalyptic year: 2012, end of the Mayan calendar and of the Twilight film franchise. Breaking Dawn — Part 2 hit theaters on November 16. Two days before, the future president of the United States tweeted this:  After Friday’s Twilight release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen–she will cheat on him again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2012  And four days before that, he tweeted this:  Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart…I hope! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2012  Two weeks before that, he tweeted this:  Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say ""Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!"" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012  And the day before that, he tweeted this:  Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2012  Four days before that, he tweeted this:  Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2012  And this!  Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again–100 certain–am I ever wrong? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2012  And the day before that, he tweeted this.  Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again–just watch. He can do much better! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2012  Thanks to the magic of social media and his own obsession with press coverage, the American people have access to a rich archive of our president’s unseemly fixations. Trump’s brief obsession with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ranks alongside his diatribe about his predecessor’s gum-chewing habit as the strangest of these. What drove him to tweet seven times about the breakup of America’s sweethearts? Why did he seem so desperate for Pattinson’s friendship? And what did the subjects of his sweaty speculation think of all this?  Until now, like the great philosophical inquiries, all of these questions were virtually unanswerable. Today, those of us who care about these things got some long-awaited insight into one of them, at least. That’s because a noble reporter at Entertainment Weekly had the good sense to ask Pattinson about it. Unfortunately, Pattinson’s answer wasn’t particularly revealing:  Does it seem somewhat surreal that the current president of the United States once wrote a bunch of tweets about you?  [Laughs] I think there’s so many different levels of it. Your identity exists on many different planes at the same time and they all can be quite different from each other. When he said that, it didn’t really mean anything. But I guess now I’m sort of thinking, like, “Well, I guess that is related to me.” But how does that fit in with all the other things going on in my life? And sometimes you think, “Can I use this in my acting? Or should I be putting it away.” It’s kind of interesting, I guess. I don’t know — this could be why people get annoyed with me.  Now all we need to do is pick the brain of MEAT BALL’S GHOST, the guy who used the RPatz/KStew tweets to predict Trump’s presidency.",0

"On Tuesday, Jennifer Lawrence wore a black Versace gown to a photo-call in London promoting her latest film, Red Sparrow. Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley’s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.  “I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,” she wrote on Wednesday. “That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”  She continued to call the discussions “sexist,” saying they were “creating silly distractions from real issues.”  “Get a grip people,” she finished. “Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT’S MY CHOICE TOO!”  Lawrence has since shifted the focus away from her bare limbs and to the crush she shares with most of the Oscar movie-watching planet, Timothée Chalamet. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both “hot” and “talented.”  “Timothée, I’m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?” she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. “[I’m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I’m going to swing right in there as soon as he’s, like, 30.”",0

"CLOSE Prince Harry and fiancée Meghan Markle share the romantic details of their proposal! They detailed everything from how Harry got down on one knee to why Meghan didn't let him finish the big question. USA TODAY  In this photo taken from video Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle talk about their engagement during an interview in London, Monday, Nov. 27, 2017. It was announced Monday that Prince Harry, fifth in line for the British throne, will marry American actress Meghan Markle in the spring, confirming months of rumors. (Photo: AP)  LONDON — People around the world — from celebrity Kim Kardashian to regular folks — rushed to congratulate Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle on their engagement Monday. But many here, where the royal family resides, reacted in British ho-hum fashion.  ""I'm happy for the geezer, but I don't care,"" John Hedge, 42, said on a street in Streatham, a mixed-income neighborhood in south London.  That low-key response, expressed by others in the British capital, matched the way Harry said he popped the big question: while they were cooking a roast chicken during a ""standard, typical night"" at their cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.  ""Not interested,"" said Tony Jones, a commuter rushing to a train at London's Victoria station Monday evening.  Other Britons took to social media to ask whether the engagement would mean an extra day off — it won't. ""Give us the bank holiday or else,"" wrote Owen Jones, a left-wing newspaper columnist who believes the monarchy should be abolished.  Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the wedding day — sometime in the spring — will not be a national holiday, in contrast to the 2011 nuptials of Harry's older brother and future king, Prince William and Duchess Kate.  More: Palace: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announce engagement  More: Prince Harry: Princess Diana 'would be over the moon'  ""Me thinking about the monarchy on a normal day V me realising we might get a bank holiday for the Royal Wedding,"" said a Twitter user with the handle @Gamble1878. Posted with the tweet was a picture of a protester holding a sign that said ""down with the monarchy"" next to a separate image of a man dressed in a suit emblazoned with the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom.  Me thinking about the monarchy on a normal day V me realising we might get a bank holiday for the Royal Wedding pic.twitter.com/tLIb0WlLC9 — Gamble (@Gamble1878) November 27, 2017  Others were more upbeat, despite what some described as ""royal wedding and baby fatigue,"" referring to William and Kate's marriage and their two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, with a third on the way.  ""I love Harry,"" said carpenter Jerry Walsh, 61, outside a pub in south London. ""He's the most natural of them (the royal family). They can do their own thing — let them live their lives. She's a beautiful girl — good luck to them. When his mum (Princess Diana) died, I felt for them.""  More: See Meghan Markle's engagement ring with diamonds from Princess Diana  More: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: 10 things to know about the royal engagement  Marie Elleston, a housewife in her 60s, described the news as ""lovely."" ""I heard it on the news today,"" she said. ""She's very nice — she's a beautiful woman,"" she added about Markle, 36, a Los Angeles native who met Harry, 33, last year when he launched the Invictus Games in Toronto, where her TV show Suits is filmed.  ""I'm happy,"" said Kathleen Connell, 78, adding that Markle is ""different from everyone else.""  ""It's fantastic,"" she added.  CLOSE Tourists react to Prince Harry’s engagement Video provided by AFP Newslook  Reaction outside Buckingham Palace, a top draw for tourists worldwide, was also relatively low-key.  ""I think it's perfectly fine for her to marry into the royal family,"" said Kieran Verseim, a medical lab technician from Denver. ""Anybody should be able to chose who they want to marry regardless of background,"" she said.  Markle, who is biracial, will be the first non-white person to marry into the royal family in modern history, a fact that sparked debate about interracial marriages in the United Kingdom. About 1 in every 10 people are in racially mixed relationships in the U.K., according to the latest census data.  ""We don't know too much about the royal family in Turkey,"" said Tarik Dogan, 42, an engineer from Istanbul as he marveled at the queen's official residence.  ""The little ones, the children, they are sweet,"" he added, referring to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  Unlike some locals, the tourism industry reacted with glee about the next royal wedding. Visit London, the official city guide, congratulated Harry and Meghan and said the royal family are ""so important for tourism in London.""  Tourism across the U.K. linked to the royal family generates more than $666 million a year and attracts more than 2.7 million visitors, according to Visit London.  Last year saw a record for international visitors to London, the tourism group said. ""And royal heritage was a big part of driving that.""      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2iYjJ3m",0

Someone's looking hawt after their post-break-up make-over!  Gone are the bad jeans and the 'Mummy tops'. Newly-single Katie Holmes had a whole new look when she went out for dinner last night.  And we like it!    Wearing a sexy black leather jacket and an elegant green maxi-dress, all glammed up with a boxy clutch-bag, Katie looked the best we've seen her for ages.  Single life obviously suits her.  Katie met her mystery friend for dinner at trendy restaurant Nomad in New York.  And even gave him a peck on the cheek as he put her in a taxi at the end of the night.  He was wearing a wedding ring though, so we're guessing they're just mates.  But still, it's nice to get taken out for dinner and stuff.  (Image: Splash)  (Image: Splash)  (Image: Splash)  It looks like an episode of Sex and The City - and Katie would SO be Charlotte.  Katie was due to make her first red-carpet appearance post-divorce tonight at the Dizzy Feet Foundation gala in LA, but she decided to pull out.  Probably so she could go on more fun date nights in New York.  But if Katie's had a glam-over, six-year-old Suri is taking a back-seat in the fashion stakes.  She took a break from the designer frocks and heels and went out in, um, a blanket the other day.  You can read about that here if you so wish.",0

"“The Bachelorette” star Rachel Lindsay is engaged to Bryan Abasolo.  Interested in The Bachelorette? Add The Bachelorette as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Bachelorette news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  After weeks of narrowing down her suitors from 31 men, the 32-year-old trial attorney from Dallas chose the 37-year-old Colombian chiropractor living in Miami.  Abasolo had sparks with Lindsay from the very first episode of the show’s latest season, even passionately kissing her before the competition. The bold move not only helped him secure the first impression rose, but also, it seems, solidified a permanent place in Lindsay's heart.  Lindsay chose her fiancé over finalists Peter Kraus, the 31-year-old business owner from Madison, Wisconsin, and Eric Bigger, the 29-year-old Baltimore native.  Big thanks to @therachlindsay for taking me on one of the greatest dates of my life! #thebachelorette A post shared by Dr. Bryan Abasolo (@thebryanabasolo) on Jun 26, 2017 at 7:26pm PDT  The bride-to-be chose Abasolo after a romantic date on a hot air ballon in Spain. It was also after Lindsay had a tearful goodbye with Kraus because he just wasn't ready to propose.  The bachelorette admitted that because of her emotional goodbye to Kraus, who was emphatic about only proposing if he was absolutely sure and not because the show's season finale was set to air, she wasn't as prepared as she could've been at the final rose ceremony.  ""I’ve never been more confused than I have this week,"" she told Abasolo. ""I was trying to find cracks in what seemed like the perfect foundation.""  But Lindsay said she couldn't find any. ""I see my forever,"" she told him. ""I see my future.""  That meant Abasolo was left to do one thing: propose.  ""I am the best version of myself when I'm with you,"" he said. ""You are so easy and effortless to love and I just want to love you for the rest of your life. Will you be my cariña [sweetheart] forever?""  Lindsay jumped up and down, saying yes.  It was clear from the very first episode that Lindsay, the first African-American bachelorette in the 13-season history of the franchise, was serious about finding love.  On the season premiere, she explained why she turned to the reality show to help her find a life partner and husband.  ""I have neglected other areas of my life,"" Lindsay explained. ""It's hard to take off that lawyer hat and put on the other one [to find love].""  Lindsay and Abasolo said they're not rushing to plan a wedding. Right now, ""we just want to bring our lives together,"" the future groom said.  But the two have agreed on one thing: a winter wedding.  “I’m from Texas ... obviously,"" Lindsay said explaining her preference,"" but we’re not rushing anything.""",1
"Looks like Margot Robbie is going to need some aloe for this burn! At the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday, Nov. 5 in LA, Margot, 27, excitedly approached Angelina Jolie to introduce herself. But instead of a warm reply, Angie “curtly replied, ‘I know who you are’ and turned her back on Margot,” an insider exclusively tells In Touch.  According to the source, the Australian-born beauty “looked shocked.” Jealousy may be to blame. When Margot starred in 2015’s The Big Short alongside Angelina’s ex Brad Pitt, “rumors swirled about Brad crushing on Margot and that Angelina had tried to stop Brad from casting Margot in the film,” says the insider.  (Photo Credit: Splash)  The source says that the mom-of-six — who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9, and Knox, 9, with Brad, 53 — can’t shake her resentment toward the Suicide Squad actress. “It was clear from Angelina’s reaction to Margot that she still holds a grudge,” the source says.  Back in November 2016, not long after Angelina, 42, filed for divorce from Brad, OK! Magazine reported that the Fight Club hunk was “ready to move on” with Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now,” a source said at the time. “This was a sore subject with [Angelina] who blocked them from working together a few times. Now that he’s single again, you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.”  While a romance between Brad and Margot never flourished, the eternal heartthrob has recently fell for 21-year-old British actress Ella Purnell — who, in an ironic twist, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent. He’s so enchanted, a source previously told In Touch, that he cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.  “Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,” said the source. “Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she’s getting from Brad.

Heidi, 44, looks like a fountain of youth but it obviously takes more of an effort than we knew. But her loved one are over her ramming her perfection down their throats.  Adds the insider, “What also really annoys people is how Heidi fakes being normal. She even pretends to eat junk food when the cameras are on her but she hasn’t actually swallowed a bite of a burger in years.”  Just last month, she and her boyfriend spent time in Italy, so we really have no idea how she avoided the pasta and pizza!  “All she talks about is working out and what she’s eaten that day – which is usually not much more than a handful of nuts and steamed kale.” That doesn’t sound like fun.",0
"The couple once inspired a Taylor Swift track  Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have confirmed that they have split up.  The Girls actor and writer and the Bleachers singer/songwriter had been a couple since 2012, but it has now been revealed that they separated last month.  “It was mutual,” a source told E! News. “Jack and Lena were growing apart and it just made sense for them to end their relationship where it was.”  They added: “They want the best for each other no matter what. They are both moving on.”  Representatives from the couple then confirmed that they were no longer together.  Bleachers, whose recent album ‘Gone Now‘ was named as one of NME’s best albums of 2017, last year had Dunham direct the video for ‘Don’t Take The Money‘.  Recent years have seen Antonoff act as producer and co-writer with the likes of St Vincent, Lorde and Taylor Swift – the latter once said that his relationship with Dunham inspired the ‘1989’ album track ‘You Are In Love‘.  “I’ve never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena [Dunham] has told me about her and Jack [Antonoff],” she said. “That’s just basically stuff she’s told me. And I think that that kind of relationship — God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful — would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times.”",0
"Adam West, the actor who brought deadpan comedy and a hero’s jutting jaw to the title character of TV’s landmark ’60s superhero series Batman, died yesterday at the age of 88. A spokesperson for the family said West died of leukemia, surrounded by family.  A cultural phenomenon from the moment it debuted on January 12, 1966 on ABC, Batman was a twice-weekly treat for children – with its comic book-style POW!s and BAM!s highlighting the climactic fight scenes – and, with its campy humor and pop-art visuals, adults as well.  Rex Features via AP  A parade of weekly villains – from Cesar Romero’s Joker, Frank Gorshin’s Riddler, Burgess Meredith’s Penguin and, impeccably, Julie Newmar’s Catwoman – passed through 120 episodes from beginning to the March 14, 1968 end, but it was West and Burt Ward as his sidekick (and ward) Robin that anchored the happenings with a note-perfect send-up of stoicism.  “Our dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight,” West’s family said in a statement, “and aspired to make a positive impact on his fans’ lives. He was and always will be our hero.”  West is survived by his wife Marcelle, six children, five grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. His career spanned six decades during which he appeared in more than 50 films and television shows, most recently as the voice of Mayor Adam West on Family Guy, and as a guest star on The Big Bang Theory.  West, a Seattle native born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928, began working in local radio while still in college, served as an announcer on American Forces Network television during an Army stint, then worked at various local TV stations, at one point landing a gig in Hawaii co-hosting a weekday show with Peaches the chimp.  A Warner Brothers contract brought a steady stream of bit roles, guest shots and series regular spots on episodic television as the ’50s eased into the ’60s: Lawman, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bronco, Colt .45, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, The Detectives, Bonanza, Petticoat Junction, Bewitched, and films like Tammy and the Doctor and, with the Three Stooges, The Outlaws Is Coming.  Oddly enough, it was West’s appearance in a spy-themed Nestle’s Quik commercial that got noticed by producer William Dozier, and West was soon cast, along with newcomer Ward, in the arch series about arch-villains and the Caped Crusaders who, week after week, tracked them, fought them and finally handed them over to Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) and Police Chief O’Hara (Stafford Repp).  Though the series quickly attained an odd combo of mass popularity and cult fervor, the joke – and the budget – began wearing thin just as fast, and a third season crept along without as much assistance from Yvonne Craig’s new Batgirl as might have been necessary.  Associated Press  West, like Ward and others who populated the California-sunny Gotham City, would never overcome the typecasting, and by 1980 was eking out a career in embarrassments like The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. After semi-retirement in Idaho, he’d eventually embrace his past by voicing animated programs from 1984’s Superfriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show to 2004’s The Batman (not, alas, in the title role). He became familiar to 21st Century generations via Family Guy (as Mayor Adam West), Comic-Con and other nostalgia appearances and the 2014 release of Batman on DVD.  West received a star on The Hollywood Hall of Fame star in 2012, a moment captured in James E. Tooley’s 2013 doc Starring Adam West.",1
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense.  “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ‘DEPLORABLES,'” he wrote on on Tuesday night, two days after Sunday’s Primetime Emmy Awards telecast. The President is in New York, staying at Trump Tower, during the United Nations General Assembly.  I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ""DEPLORABLES."" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017  The Emmys, broadcast by CBS, were about on par with last year’s ceremony in terms of total viewers. Sunday’s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016’s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year’s low point of a 2.8.  Host Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump’s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for “The Apprentice.” In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.  According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2013  Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, criticized the “politicized” show for the “sameness” of the attacks on Trump.  Related Rachel Brosnahan on Emmy Win and 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 Trump Names Patrick Shanahan Acting Secretary of Defense, Moves Up Mattis' Departure  “It looks like Americans are tuning out,” she said on “Fox & Friends.”  Then she addressed stars who appeared on the stage. “They want you to stick to your knitting. They want you to stick to the stuff that other people write for you.”  She did, however, praise Sean Spicer for his Emmy cameo, in which he made fun of his own post-inauguration press conference in which he chided the media never its reporting on Trump’s inaugural crowd size. Spicer’s appearance has drawn a backlash from Trump detractors who criticized Colbert and Emmy producers for milking laughs out of a political operative who had been a champion of Trump’s polarizing agenda.  “This is something that folks in Hollywood often lack — which is introspection and good humor,” Conway said of Spicer.  Trump spoke at the UN earlier on Tuesday in a speech in which he said that the U.S. would “totally destroy” North Korea if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies.”",1
"Preliminary polling showed that there was high interest among women in an Oprah Winfrey presidential candidacy in 2020. According to a Quinnipiac poll in January, women would back the former talk-show host 58 percent to 33 percent against President Trump. Men were evenly divided, with 45 percent supporting each.  But Winfrey shared that some influential men have encouraged her to consider a run for the White House.  “I had a lot of wealthy men calling, telling me that they would run my campaign and raise $1 billion for me. I think that when you have that many people whose opinions you value coming at you, it's worthy of thinking about,” she told ""60 Minutes Overtime” correspondent Ann Silvio.  Despite the offers, Winfrey said the lack of spiritual confirmation is what has kept her from seriously weighing a run.  “If God actually wanted me to run, wouldn't God kind of tell me? And I haven't heard that,” she said.  So for now, it seems as though we can count Winfrey out of a presidential race.  “I am actually humbled by the fact that people think that I could be a leader of the free world, but it's just not in my spirit,” she told Silvio. “It's not in my DNA.”  Much of the interest in the political aspirations of the mogul was rooted in her stirring Golden Globes speech on the sexual abuse and harassment of women by men in power. Winfrey, who in the past has talked about her own sexual abuse, has historically made respect for women part of her identity.  “I was just trying to give a good speech. I was looking for a way to express what was going on in this moment in terms of gender and class and race. I cared about landing that speech in the room,” Winfrey said.  Despite her past declarations of disinterest in running for president, many Americans rallied behind the moment. Overall, the Quinnipiac poll had Winfrey winning 52 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent if she ran against him in 2020.  Trump's overall approval rating has inched up since Winfrey's speech, but he is in the midst of a scandal about the White House's handling of allegations against now-former staff secretary Rob Porter, who was accused of abuse by two ex-wives. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by almost 20 women, has regularly stood up for men on his side who have been accused of sexual abuse or harassment, including Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama, Fox News Channel's Roger Ailes and former talk-show host Bill O'Reilly.  And Saturday, in the middle of the Porter scandal, he did it again.  “Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused — life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?” Trump tweeted.  A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that more than 8 in 10 men view sexual harassment of women in the workplace as a problem. And only 35 percent of men think that the amount of national attention given to the issue has been sufficient.  It is clear from recent polling, Winfrey’s claims about male political donors as well as criticism against Trump that men also are looking for a leader who can respond effectively to the crisis of the abuse of women.  But it won’t be Winfrey, apparently.  However, the men who would back her in a presidential contest need not worry about her disengaging.  “I do feel that I have a responsibility, as a person who has a big voice in this country, to use it to promote justice and kindness and goodwill in the world. But it has never felt to me that that was supposed to be political,” Winfrey said.",1
"(CNN) Singer Demi Lovato is awake and with her family after being hospitalized earlier Tuesday, according to a statement from the singer's representative.

""Demi is awake and with her family, who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support,"" said the statement from Lovato's representative.

"She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family.  ""There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,"" said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to ""be masculine"" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a ""tyranny by the minority.""  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the ""new director"" of the Academy's ""minority outreach program.""  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her ""goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.""  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state's 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California's 43rd District.  ""After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" Dash said in her statement. ""I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.""  She added that she knows her ""political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable.""",1
"Halle Berry is not pregnant at 50, despite a slew of inaccurate reports. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this fake news. We’re told it’s “simply untrue.”  According to a slew of speculative and incorrect stories, Berry is expecting her third child and debuted a “baby bump” at the 16th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in Los Angeles. The Mirror, for example, wrote that the actress appeared on the “red carpet proudly cradling a ‘baby bump.'” The British tabloid further claimed Berry “has yet to publicly announce her pregnancy.” “When she stood to the side, the bump was even more apparent, and Halle made no effort to conceal her new curves,” added the misguided newspaper.  Similarly, the fake news manufacturers at HollywoodLife maintained Berry is going to “be a mama for the third time around!” They also cut-and-pasted the phrase that wrongfully alleged the actress was “cradling a baby bump on the carpet.” Since HollywoodLies often speculates rather than actually reports, the repeatedly discredited outlet asserted that that Berry had “quite a glow about her as she rested her hands on the apparent bump with a huge smile on her face.”",0
"He reportedly hasn't seen her in over four years.  Tom Cruise supposedly hasn't seen his daughter in over four years — and that didn't change when she turned 12 last week.  Suri Cruise is now apparently desperate to connect with her dad and is tired of her mom Katie Holmes' excuses.  Tom, 55, has missed ""one milestone after another.""  “Like any little girl, her greatest wish is for her father to be there, and now she’s been disappointed again,” an insider told Star magazine. ""That would be painful for any child, and you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it’s taking on Suri.""  Though a recent report from Hollywood Life revealed that Tom did send Suri a birthday gift, he didn't show up for her birthday party on April 18.  And this isn't the first time.  “Tom hasn’t been there to watch Suri blow out the candles since she turned 7,” another source said. “It’s so sad!”  As Suri gets older, she's questioning Holmes, 39, more and more why her father doesn't come around. They haven't been photographed together since 2012.  ""Suri has to be wondering why Tom doesn’t come and visit. It seems like the older she gets, the more desperate she must be to see him,” the insider said. “Now that Suri’s older, [the excuses] may not fly anymore.”  Want to feel old? Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's daughter Suri Cruise is 12 today. — Alexis Benveniste (@apbenven) April 18, 2018  Reports suggest that the reason for Tom's absence from his daughter's life is his religion, Scientology.  When family members leave the church, people related to them who decide to stay are known for distancing themselves. So when Holmes decided to leave the church, Tom was expected by his fellow church members to stop talking to Suri as well.  Though he doesn't see her in person, supposedly, he does come through with a gift for every birthday and holiday.  Suri gets a gift from Tom on her birthday every year and this year was no exception,” a source claimed. “It’s not something Katie talks about though, beyond saying that Tom does always come through with gifts for things like birthdays and Christmas, she’s very tight-lipped.”  Emily Blackwood is an editor at YourTango who covers pop culture, true crime, dating, relationships and everything in between.

"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",0
"A shocking new report claims Kourtney Kardashian’s pregnant again — and they have a theory as to who the father may be! Is it her ex, Younes Bendjima?    Here’s another plot twist in Kourtney Kardashian’s love life. The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with “what appeared to be a bump” in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! “It was strange to see because she’s usually so perfectly svelte,” a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, “Everyone is whispering that she’s pregnant with her fourth child.” If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it’s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney’s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney’s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim — it’s more than likely Scott!  “They’ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,” the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 – but reportedly, that was not on Scott’s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a “recent” trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! “They made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,” the source said before adding, “Everyone is buzzing that she’s carrying Scott’s baby.” As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven’t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn’t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because “all of their kids came out beautifully.”  And apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren’t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney’s alleged baby bump wasn’t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone’s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly “isn’t sure how to handle this situation.” The friend added that Kourtney “isn’t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she’s been spending time with…it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner’s] management skills to straighten out this mess!”  Maybe this report isn’t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum – it’s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? “[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,” our source told us. “So if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.”  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima’s and Scott Disick’s reps for a comment.",0

A source told E! News: ""Scott had at least 15 women crowded around at his booth. While smiling and laughing, he placed a hand on the shoulders of two of them, pulled them towards him and made out with both of them at the same time.""  Meanwhile, it was recently reported that 34-year-old Scott's former partner Kourtney Kardashian hopes their children Mason, seven, Penelope, four, and Reign, two, can help him to curb his partying lifestyle.  An insider said: ""She wants her kids to have a relationship with him.  ""She hopes that by allowing him to see the kids, it will motivate him.  ""The kids are the best possible influence on Scott.

The 38-year-old reality star believes allowing the children to spend time with their father is the ""right thing to do"".  The source said: ""[Kourtney feels it is] the right thing to do is to help foster their relationship with him and not stand in the way.

Clarkson went on to gush over Pink's latest album Beautiful Trauma, ""I love her because she has done the whole singer-songwriter record she recently did, she does pop, she loves rock."" Clarkson also added that she loves Pink's unapologetic nature, that, “She is who she is, and that’s cool if you like her, and it’s cool if you don’t.

Hello Billy, Mr. Buress was arrested for disorderly intoxication, on December 9, 2017, at approximately 10:30 p.m. — Miami PD (@MiamiPD) December 10, 2017  According to Miami Herald, Buress was booked in the Wynwood Arts District, which is hosting numerous Art Basel-related events, on a disorderly intoxication charge at 1:57 a.m. and posted bail around 6 a.m. The Herald reports that the incident began when Buress asked a nearby police officer to call him an Uber.

"Chris Cornell‘s widow, Vicky, has published an emotional open letter to her late husband. “I’m sorry you were alone, and I know that was not you, my sweet Christopher,” she wrote to in the note, issued via Billboard. “Your children know that too, so you can rest in peace.”  Elsewhere in the soul-bearing letter, she wrote that she thinks of the Soundgarden, Audioslave and Temple of the Dog frontman “every minute of every day,” adding, “I will fight for you” and that she still felt connected to him. “It has been said that paths that have crossed will cross again, and I know that you will come find me, and I will be here waiting,” she wrote.  Chris died of suicide by hanging last Thursday at the age of 52. Shortly after his death, Vicky issued a statement speculating that her husband had suffered an adverse side effect of Ativan, an anxiety medication he took. “When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different,” she wrote then. “When he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him. What happened is inexplicable and I am hopeful that further medical reports will provide additional details. I know that he loved our children and he would not hurt them by intentionally taking his own life.”  A note from Vicky’s lawyer, Kirk Pasich, accompanied her statement then, saying that: “Chris, a recovering addict, had a prescription for Ativan and may have taken more Ativan than recommended dosages.” Moreover, he said that if Chris had taken his own life, he’d done so unknowingly.  Cornell’s family will hold a funeral for the singer on Friday at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever cemetery. It is also planning on holding a public memorial, though details for that are not yet public.  Read Vicky Cornell’s full open letter:  To My Sweet Christopher,  You were the best father, husband and son-in-law. Your patience, empathy and love always showed through.

"Rosanna Arquette is spilling the beans on the one who got away.  The actress, 58, was on Thursday’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen where she was asked by a fan if she’d ever turned down a Hollywood star when her own was rising in the ’80s thanks to films like Desperately Seeking Susan and The Big Blue.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Warren Beatty,” she answered, to a surprised-looking Cohen.

"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love.""  Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation’s favorite couples — but it didn't always look that way.  Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say “I do” in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.  But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.  Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.  ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn’t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.”  Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.  Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise — and they now have their first child on the way.  When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. “We were sort of in that wedding glow,” Bass explains. “It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.”  Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass’ face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. “His jaw was on the floor.”  Bass added, “It felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.” The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings.  Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass’ groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: “Wells was like, ‘I don’t care man. I’m there.’”  The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.  Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show — and potentially the series — would ever resume. “I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.""  In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set — something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. “No one drank that much. It wasn’t like a crazy affair,” Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding.  ""Paradise is a great parody of life,"" says Bass. ""I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It’s very American. We’re ridiculous, but it’s awesome.”  And he still disagrees that Paradise is ""a drunk hookup show,"" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. ""There’s sexuality on the show,"" Bass says. ""The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there’s so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don’t really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.”  Waddell adds, “We’re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.”  Waddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach. The pair, who are due around Valentine's Day, are calling it a ""love child"" and will find out the sex of the baby in a week or so.  ""We’re out of our minds with excitement,"" she says.  ""The Bachelor producers are some of our greatest friends now,"" she adds. ""We were texting them pictures of our ultrasound, that’s how close we’ve become.""  During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He’s an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says.  As for the rest of the Paradise season — which returns to ""being Paradise"" after addressing the shutdown in the first two weeks — Bass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch.  ""There’s going to be another couple this season that takes our place,"" says Bass, whose advice to making it as a couple is to ignore the negativity. ""You can’t let the haters affect your relationship,"" he adds. ""There’s no way it doesn’t affect you, but you have to work through that together. It’s crazy how one person’s tweet affects you.""  Waddell adds, ""Just be real and be honest.""",1
"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",0
"Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.",1
"Abby Lee Miller is ""on the mend"" following another spinal surgery.  The former Dance Moms star, who was preliminarily diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma in April before undergoing emergency back surgery, took to Instagram on Saturday to give her fans an update after undergoing a second operation.  In a graphic photo of her back, Miller shows her stitches and scars and reveals she got 52 staples.  ""After the 2nd surgery, My back is finally on the mend. I just wish the top section & bottom would hurry along too!"" she captioned the shot. ""I had 52 staples perfectly aligned and now a bunch of crazy stitches are holding my neck & lumbar region together! #abbyleemiller #abbylee #dancemoms @hoomanmelamedmd #aldc #aldcla #spjne #disc.""  Earlier this month, the 51-year-old reality star revealed on her social media that she underwent another ""quick little emergency surgery.""  ""After another 2 hour MRI this morning, the pros thought I needed one more quick little emergency surgery!"" Miller captioned a picture of her arm in a hospital bed, complete with admission bracelets and an IV port. ""Ugh! I’m in recovery now and texting so everything must be ok, just hiccups in my plans!""  She's also been documenting her chemotherapy treatment with her fans, yet staying as positive as she can.  Burkitt Lymphoma, which is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is a form of cancer that affects the lymphatic system and starts in antibody-producing B cells, which are part of the immune system. Miller's orthopedic spine surgeon, Dr. Hooman Melamed, previously told ET that “people who have been diagnosed with this have a good prognosis.""",1
"Like those holographic snakes that periodically go viral on Twitter, eye shadow palettes are simultaneously beautiful and terrifying things. The myriad of matte and metallic shades look stunning, but the thought of getting a selection of them onto lids without looking like a child's art project gone wrong can scare people away from them entirely. Without the right blending, the shadows could end up looking muddy, splotchy, patchy, or harsh. Cringe. The word ""blending"" in and of itself freaks some people out. Trust and believe that there's nothing to be afraid of. Unlike those holographic snakes, eye shadow doesn't have fangs.  I asked a handful of professional makeup artists to demystify eye shadow blending, and I swear blending is easier than it looks with their tips. You don't have to be giving celebrities perfectly diffused smoky eyes all day and all night to master the technique.  Before you do anything, though, don't do anything at all. If you ask Patrick Ta, a professional makeup artist who's worked with Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, your eye makeup should be applied before the rest of your makeup. ""I always say to do your eyes first to avoid fall-out from your eye shadows,"" Ta tells Allure. ""If you prefer to do your face first, you can use Shadow Shields to avoid this as well.""  OK, now that we have that out of the way, here are five steps to eye shadow blending.  1. Prime for success.  If you're going to take the time out of your busy day to blend your shadow to perfection, you might as well smooth some eye shadow primer onto your lids to keep everything in place. Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, tells Allure, ""I keep it closer to the lash line and fade it as I go upward so I have more flexibility to blend in the crease area."" Then let it dry for at least 10 seconds before moving on to the main event.  Need a primer rec? Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion is always a good choice. Allure editors also love Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  Primer isn't required for pro blending, though. Many makeup artists, like Mario Dedivanovic, would rather skip it. Instead, he prefers to tap leftover foundation or concealer onto lids to give the shadows some grip.  2. Pick your tools.  Depending on which makeup artist you ask, you're going to get a different answer for what the best blending brush is. Regardless, ""flawless eye shadow blending is all about brushes,"" says Giselle Ali, who's worked with SZA and Cynthia Erivo. ""You have to have the right tools for the job. You can never have enough blending brushes, but two is good to start with."" The key is to keep both of these clean. Don't dip these into your eye shadow pans. Instead, use a denser brush like the Best of Beauty Award–winning E.L.F. Beautifully Precise Eyeshadow Brush No. 201 to lay down pigments before blending.  Ta swears by the Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush. Ali prefers the Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush.  Strozzi, on the other hand, has a completely different list of essentials. For blending powders all over the lid, the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush is her ride-or-die. When focusing on the creases, she prefers the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush. For cream shadows and powders that are on the denser side, she reaches for M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush because ""one side is synthetic, which helps apply the product, and the other natural side is great for blending it out,"" she explains.",1

"(CNN) Actor Charlie Sheen told NBC's ""Today"" show Tuesday that he was diagnosed as HIV-positive about four years ago, and that a few people who knew it demanded money from him to keep the secret.  ""I'm here to admit that I am in fact HIV-positive,"" Sheen told NBC's Matt Lauer. ""And I have to put a stop to this onslaught, this barrage of attacks and of sub-truths and very harmful and mercurial stories that are about the [alleged] threatening the health of so many others, which couldn't be farther from the truth.""  Sheen, 50, said he is not sure how he contracted the virus. Since his diagnosis, he said, he has informed every sexual partner of his condition. He called it ""impossible"" that he had transferred the virus to others.  He said the diagnosis came after he suffered a series of cluster headaches and night sweats.  ""After a battery of tests ... they walked in the room and said, 'Boom, here's what's going on,'"" Sheen said.  ""It's a hard three letters to absorb,"" he said. ""It's a turning point in one's life.""  Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Charlie Sheen has been in the public eye almost as long as the 50 years he's been alive. The actor, seen here in 2013, has appeared in dozens of films, headlined a hit TV show, battled substance abuse, dated porn stars and made numerous headlines for his bad-boy behavior. Here's a look at Sheen's turbulent life and career. Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years As the son of actor Martin Sheen, he had small parts in some of his father's films. The public may have first become aware of him as a thuggish visitor in a police station making conversation with Jennifer Grey in 1986's ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" That same year, Sheen starred in Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning film ""Platoon,"" playing Chris, a soldier in Vietnam caught in a battle between Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen and Stone teamed up again in 1987 with ""Wall Street,"" in which Sheen played an up-and-coming broker seduced by Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko. Douglas' performance won an Oscar, and Sheen's own stock went up. Hide Caption 3 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen played relief pitcher Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn in the 1989 baseball comedy ""Major League."" The box office hit led to a 1994 sequel, ""Major League II,"" also featuring Sheen. Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years After becoming one of the hottest young actors of the '80s, Sheen saw his star dim in the '90s. Here he is in a poster for ""Men at Work,"" a minor comedy that starred him and brother Emilio Estevez as garbagemen who stumble on a nefarious plot. Hide Caption 5 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years ""Terminal Velocity,"" a 1994 film in which he played a skydiving instructor, fared even worse. Critics wondered whether the film was a goof, comparable to Sheen's ""Hot Shots!"" parody series. It made just $17 million at the box office on a $50 million budget. Hide Caption 6 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years By the mid-'90s, Sheen was as famous for being a ladies' man as he was for being a leading man. Known as ""the Machine,"" he dated porn stars, and though Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss kept the names of her clients secret, Sheen testified during her tax-evasion trial that he'd used her services. He also spent time in rehab and was hospitalized for a drug overdose . ""Pray for my boy,"" said his father. ""He has appetites that get him into trouble."" Hide Caption 7 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years But after a well-received turn in 1999's ""Being John Malkovich"" -- in which he played, well, Charlie Sheen -- Sheen was cast as Michael J. Fox's replacement in the hit ABC show ""Spin City."" Show creator Gary David Goldberg praised him. ""He's the first one on the set every morning and the last to leave at night,"" he said. The show ran until 2002. Hide Caption 8 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen rose to the top again with ""Two and a Half Man,"" playing free-spirited jingle writer Charlie Harper. The show was one of the highest-rated on television, and Sheen soon became the highest-paid actor on TV, eventually making close to $2 million an episode. But a rehab stint shut down production in 2010, and he and show creator Chuck Lorre were soon at loggerheads. Sheen was fired after the eighth season. Hide Caption 9 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen occasionally popped up in movies in the 2000s, though not of the level of his '80s work. Among them were ""Scary Movie 3,"" seen here with Denise Richards, ""Scary Movie 4"" and ""Scary Movie 5."" Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years In 2002, Sheen married Richards. The marriage produced two daughters but was rocky; Richards filed a restraining order against him in 2006 and filed for divorce while pregnant with their second child. Sheen later tried to block the appearance of their children on Richards' reality show and insulted her in the media, a habit he's continued to the present day Hide Caption 11 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen's third marriage, to actress Brooke Mueller, was also contentious. The two married in 2008 and divorced three years later, time that included Sheen's arrest on suspicion of domestic abuse and rehab stints for both. A custody battle ensued after the divorce, but the two are getting along for now. Hide Caption 12 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years The end of Sheen's marriage to Mueller and his firing from ""Two and a Half Men"" came in the midst of increasingly erratic behavior. He allegedly trashed a New York hotel room; he went on a radio show and criticized Lorre and Thomas Jefferson, among others; and he filed a lawsuit against Lorre and ""Two and a Half Men's"" studio, Warner Bros. Television. He joined Twitter and racked up a million followers in just over 24 hours -- a record, said Guinness . His tweets included the hashtags #winning and #tigerblood, both of which became catchphrases. He's shown here with publicist Stan Rosenfield, who resigned from that job in early 2011. Hide Caption 13 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years In April 2011, he embarked on tour of his one-man show, ""My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option."" The first show, in Detroit, went off the rails quickly. ""Early in the evening, before the crowd turned sour, there was a creepy atmosphere that suggested group indoctrination into a cult,"" said a Hollywood Reporter review . And that was before the booing and shouts of ""You suck"" started. He changed the style to a Q&A for the second show, but the tour never really caught fire. Hide Caption 14 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Still, Sheen had enough buzz that he was announced as the lead in ""Anger Management,"" a TV version of the 2003 movie. The series lasted two years on FX. Meanwhile, ""Two and a Half Men"" ended its run in 2015 with Sheen's character -- who had been assumed dead -- crushed by a piano Hide Caption 15 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Since ""Anger,"" Sheen has had a guest spot on ""The Goldbergs"" and has popped up occasionally on TMZ . In November 2015 he announced to ""Today's"" Matt Lauer that he is HIV-positive. The actor said the diagnosis had inspired him to retire his hard-partying ways. ""It's a turning point in one's life,"" he said. Hide Caption 16 of 16  He said he revealed the diagnosis to people he thought he trusted, but some of them demanded money to keep the information to themselves. He paid those people ""in the millions,"" he said. Later in the show, Lauer said that Sheen told him it was more than $10 million.  ""We're talking about shakedowns,"" Sheen said. ""I've paid those people.""  One of those people, he said, was a prostitute who entered his bathroom, took a cellphone picture of his medication and threatened to sell the image.  Asked if he would continue to pay the people he'd been paying, he said: ""Not after today, I'm not.""  'Charlie does not have AIDS'  Sheen was joined on the show by his doctor, Robert Huizenga, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at UCLA ,and was asked directly if he had AIDS.  ""Charlie does not have AIDS,"" Huizenga said. ""AIDS is a condition where the HIV virus markedly suppresses the immune system and you are susceptible to rare, difficult cancers and infections. Charlie has none of those. He is healthy; he does not have AIDS.""  HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus , attacks the immune system by destroying white blood cells, which are vital to fighting infection. Once enough of these cells have been destroyed and the person has another ""opportunistic"" infection like pneumonia or tuberculosis, the diagnosis moves to the final stage of the infection, called AIDS.  There are two main ways HIV is spread in the United States -- by sex and by sharing needles, syringes or any of the equipment used to prepare and inject drugs. Anal sex carries the highest risk, followed by vaginal sex and having multiple partners.  In the ""Today"" interview, Sheen denied any possibility that he got the disease via drug use. ""No needles,"" Sheen said. He also said he was no longer on drugs, but did continue to drink and seek the company of prostitutes.  Photos: Photos: The PrEP Heroes campaign aims to increase awareness of drugs that prevent HIV from establishing itself if a person is exposed. ""Being a part of the PrEP Hero campaign was important because it was an opportunity to show diversity in communities where HIV and LGBT intersect,"" Franco De Marco said. Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: Models featured in the campaign all use the drug. ""As a community that's already dealt with hardship, hatred and discrimination, we don't need to turn on ourselves,"" Peter William Dunn said about breaking stigma around HIV and AIDS. ""Treat everyone with respect and empathy, and treat those who are HIV-positive as real human beings not defined by a disease.""

""Unlike many medical breakthroughs and preventive strategies, PrEP, and its users, faced criticism from the beginning,"" he said. ""People who used the medication are stigmatized and stereotyped, rather than supported for taking steps to protect the health of themselves and their communities."" Hide Caption 9 of 9  In the past, Sheen has admitted to frequent visits to prostitutes at various times in his life. In July 1995, he testified in the tax evasion trial of ""Hollywood madam"" Heidi Fleiss that he had spent $53,000 in one 15-month period on ""sexual services.""  Two cases of 'unprotected sex'  Sheen told Lauer that he had unprotected sex ""under the care of my doctor"" with two women since his diagnosis, but that it was ""impossible"" that he had transferred the virus to them. While Huizenga did not agree that it's ""impossible,"" he did say it was highly unlikely.  ""He was immediately put on treatment, strong antiviral drugs, which has suppressed the virus, to the point that he is absolutely healthy from that vantage,"" Huizenga said. ""Individuals who are optimally treated with undetectable viral loads, (the risk is) incredibly low to transmit the virus. We can't say it's zero, but it's an incredibly low number.""  Staying on daily medication is important to keep the HIV virus from developing resistance and spreading, experts said.  ""Resistance occurs when the virus replicates in the presence of the drugs,"" said Dr. Stephen Boswell, president and CEO of Boston's Fenway Health, a healthcare organization that works with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. ""Missed dosages lead to lower concentrations in the bloodstream and in the body, so the virus can become resistant and spread. So staying on your medications and not missing dosages is absolutely critical.""  Photos: Are we on the road to an HIV vaccine? Photos: Are we on the road to an HIV vaccine?

"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.”Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.“What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.”All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was “encouraged” by their first post-election meeting.Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS’ John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.“He was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,” Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was “inappropriate.”As Barack Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about President Donald Trump. | AP PhotoHistorically speaking, Trump’s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors’ had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. “That one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,” she saidAnd Trump hasn’t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a “bad (or sick) guy!” as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush “not nice” during the campaign, said the Bush administration “lied” about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton “the WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.”George H.W. Bush and Carter weren’t excluded from Trump’s slights. “Enough is Enough- No More Bushses!” Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.And Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and — while revealing that he voted for Sanders — Carter said the ""downturn"" of human rights ""preceded 2016.""“President Carter, I think he hopes that he won’t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,” Hochman said. “Actually, I’m sure he would.”Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He’s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.“They may have personal opinions, but they’re not going to express them,” Skinner said. “Both 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they’ve been both very cautious about what they say.”McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. “I wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,” he said.Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today’s events in Washington.“I think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,” he said.",0

"Longtime Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek told fans on Thursday he’s recovering from brain surgery to correct a “slight medical problem” he suffered during the show’s holiday break: a subdural hematoma, or blood clots on the brain.  The 77-year-old host, who had a mild heart attack in 2012 and a knee replacement in 2015, thanked and reassured the show’s fanbase in a video posted to its YouTube page. “The prognosis is excellent, and I expect to be back in the studio taping more Jeopardy! programs very, very soon,” he said. “And I want to thank all of you for your concern.”  Here’s what you should know about Trebek’s diagnosis.  What is a subdural hematoma?  A subdural hematoma is a pooling of blood between the dura — the sturdy, protective layer of tissue encasing the brain — and the surface of the brain itself, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Subdural hematomas happen when blood vessels, often veins, burst in this area, forming a collection of blood that presses on the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic.  What causes a subdural hematoma?  While this type of brain bleed is occasionally random, a subdural hematoma most often follows a traumatic head injury, such as a fall, collision or accident, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Trebek told fans that his was the result of a fall that occurred a couple months ago.  What are the symptoms of a subdural hematoma?  Subdural hematoma symptoms typically include headache, vomiting, drowsiness and eventual loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, differing pupil size and slurred speech, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms may appear immediately, but in some cases, they can take weeks or even months to manifest.  How serious is a subdural hematoma?  They can be fatal, but a person’s prognosis depends on multiple factors, from the size and severity of the bleed to how quickly treatment is sought, the U.S. National Library of Medicine says. Some subdural hematomas are reversed by drilling a hole in the skull to drain blood and relieve pressure on the brain, while others require more invasive brain surgery. Trebek did not comment on the severity of his case or his treatment plan.  Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com.",1

"Kylie Jenner loves a giant holiday centerpiece — and this year, her approach is solid gold.  The cosmetics maven, 21, showed off her glittering metallic Christmas tree standing tall in the entryway of her home on Instagram. The towering conifer features gold branches, a variety of gold ball ornaments, countless glowing lights and even a gold-wrapped stand.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  RELATED: Merry and Bright! See How Celebrities Are Decking Their Halls for the Holidays  “Gold is the theme this year,” she captions a video of the tree, with Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” serving as the soundtrack.  “Thank you @jeffleatham and team for never failing to make Christmas magic happen,” she adds, calling out the celebrity floral designer and artistic director. Leatham, who split from ex husband Colton Haynes in May, is notably also responsible for the over-the-top holiday decor at Kylie’s mom Kris’s mansion and the glam seasonal installations at Four Seasons hotels around the world.  This year’s sparkly model at Kylie’s Hidden Hills home replaces last year’s slightly more realistic one, which she called “20 feet of magic” (the gold version appears to be the same size) and featured a faux-snow covering known as flocking.  The treatment turns up on another of Kylie’s forest of trees for 2018: “I have a neon pink flocked in my bedroom. I literally have trees everywhere this year,” she says in a video documenting a particularly girly one on her Instagram Stories.  This Christmas will no doubt be extra special for Kylie and boyfriend Travis Scott as they celebrate with their 10-month-old daughter Stormi for the first time. In one video documenting the sparkly tree, the new mom zooms in on a gold ball ornament to capture a selfie in the reflection, with Stormi balanced on her hip.  RELATED: Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Buy $13.5 Million L.A. Mansion (and Split the Cost!): Source  Kylie has always gone big on holiday decor. Last year’s ceiling-scraping flocked tree — also by Leatham — was ornamented with massive balls in shades of pink. In 2016, she documented the elaborate process of getting her enormous real tree into her home. It involved a flatbed truck and took several lumberjack-like wranglers to install. That year, she also displayed a massive gingerbread house customized with her name, as well as those of her then-boyfriend, Tyga and his son, King. Her beloved dogs, Bambi, Norman, Ernesto and Penny, were even immortalized in icing.",1
"Trace Lysette, who plays yoga instructor Shea on the series, is the second accuser to allege misconduct by the show's star; Amazon says the new information ""will be added to our ongoing investigation.""  In the second season of Transparent, the groundbreaking Amazon series that traces one father's journey to womanhood, Maura Pfefferman — played by Jeffrey Tambor, in a role that has won him two Emmys — struggles to find the right inflection for the popular queer catchphrase, ""Yas queen.""  Her teacher is Shea — played by Trace Lysette — a yoga teacher and sometimes stripper, who steps in to show her fellow transgender, a newbie, the ropes.  The moment, which went viral shortly after the season debuted in November 2015, plays out as sweet, hilarious and authentic. But Lysette now says the circumstances around its filming were anything but.  According to Lysette, when she emerged from wardrobe in her costume — a salmon-colored lingerie top and matching short-shorts — Tambor remarked, ""My God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually."" Alexandra Billings, the third actor in the scene, was present to hear the remark, she confirms. Both ""laughed it off because it was so absurd,"" Lysette says.  A few minutes later, while waiting for a camera setup between takes, Lysette was standing in a corner of the soundstage set. That's when she says Tambor, dressed as Maura, wearing a green satin kimono and gray wig, approached her.  ""He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrust back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas,"" Lysette says.  Lysette pushed Tambor away and ""rolled my eyes."" Billings was not present for this alleged incident, and several crewmembers were nearby ""but they were focused on their jobs. It was discreet. If you were behind Jeffrey you might have thought he was giving me a hug.""  The actress, who is transgender, is the second on the Transparent payroll to come forward with allegations that Tambor, 73, has subjected them to sexual harassment, sexual assault and generally abusive behavior on the set of the critically adored series.  The first accuser, Van Barnes, is a trans woman who worked as Tambor's personal assistant, and whose allegations have led to an internal investigation by Amazon Studios. She has previously appeared on E!'s I Am Cait.  According to Barnes' lawyer Alana Chazan, her client signed a nondisclosure agreement while working for Tambor and therefore could not comment on Lysette's claims. Nor would Barnes detail what workplace abuses she allegedly suffered at Tambor's hands — accusations which were made in a private Facebook post that had leaked and circulated within Hollywood transgender circles.  A copy of that Facebook post was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. In it, Barnes, without directly naming Tambor, vents about an employer who made comments like ""I should be sleeping with him if I want a Hollywood industry appropriate pay grade"" and ""it wouldn't take long, he pops quick."" She says the employer subjected her to ""butt pats,"" pornography played at loud volumes, and complaints that she ""was useless, could do nothing right.""  ""Despite having made no public statements to date, the disclosure of Van Barnes' identity by the press has already led to Ms. Barnes receiving numerous threats and harassment online,"" Chazan says. ""Ms. Barnes is cooperating with the investigation being conducted by Amazon and will not be making a statement while the investigation is pending.""  Lysette shared a house with Barnes while Barnes worked as Tambor's assistant. ""She would pick him up in the morning and bring him home at night and everything in between,"" Lysette recalls. ""She would come home wrecked and stressed. I saw him break her down. She for the most part kept it to herself. She was just like, 'Girl, he is a piece of work. If you only knew what I’m going through.' But I knew.""  For Lysette, an acting neophyte who came to Hollywood directly from New York City, where she worked as a dancer, Tambor's attentions began early and innocently enough.  She describes a moment in her first season on the show, a scene set in a yoga studio, when she had trouble finding her mark. ""Jeffrey stepped in and said, 'Come on, that’s hard. I couldn’t even do that.' And then he and the [director of photography] had a little back and forth. He was sticking up for me.""  When the exchange was over, Tambor approached Lysette and ""kissed me on the forehead and was like, 'Are you good?' I said, 'Yeah, I’m fine.' It started with things like that. Telling me I looked great, things like that.""  As Lysette began to step into the spotlight and enjoy her first tastes of fame, she recalls running into Tambor at red carpet events, where she ""would go to hug him and kiss him on the cheek — and it would land on my lips. And I was like, 'OK. What was that about?'""  She says it wasn't until the filming of the ""yas queen"" scene and the alleged physical assault that she was certain she was being targeted and sexually harassed by Tambor. From that moment on, she says life on the set with the actor ""has been a roller coaster. One minute Jeffrey is lovely, the next it's a temper tantrum or flirtation.""  Lysette describes another moment ""that sticks in my brain"" from later in production of season two: Tambor had set up a meeting between Lysette and his manager for potential representation.  Lysette thanked Tambor for the gesture, she says, ""and he said, 'Well, yeah Trace. I really believe in you. And you know what? I don't even want to have sex with you.' And then he just looked at me as if he very much indeed wanted to have sex with me. It was an up-and-down look. I rolled my eyes and went to my trailer and thought, 'This man is something else.'""  Both Lysette and Barnes say they approached Transparent producers with their complaints about Tambor, but no action was taken.  Tambor issued this statement to THR in response to Lysette's allegations:  For the past four years, I’ve had the huge privilege — and huge responsibility — of playing Maura Pfefferman, a transgender woman, in a show that I know has had an enormous, positive impact on a community that has been too long dismissed and misunderstood. Now I find myself accused of behavior that any civilized person would condemn unreservedly. I know I haven’t always been the easiest person to work with. I can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact. But I have never been a predator — ever. I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone. But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express.  An Amazon spokesperson says, ""This information will be added to our ongoing conversation.""  Lysette issued this statement to THR:  Last week, it was reported in the media that Van Barnes, who previously worked as Jeffrey Tambor's assistant while shooting Transparent, had privately spoken out on her social media about her experiences of abuse. Sadly, I must add my voice to the chorus. Jeffrey has acted inappropriate to me too.  Jeffrey has made many sexual advances and comments at me, but one time it got physical.  One day on set during Season 2, Jeffrey, Alexandra Billings and I were all outfitted in pajamas. I was in a flimsy top and matching short shorts. Upon seeing my in my costume, Jeffrey sexualized me with an over the top comment. Alexandra and I laughed it off because it was so absurd and we thought surely it had to be a bad joke. I shook it off. Then later, in between takes, I stood in a corner on the set as the crew reset for a wide shot. My back was against the wall in a corner as Jeffrey approached me. He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrusts back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas and I pushed him off of me. Again, I laughed it off and rolled my eyes. I had a job to do and I had to do it with Jeffrey, the lead of our show. When they called action, I put that moment in the corner into its own corner of my mind. Compartmentalizing has always been part of my survival took kit, long before I came to Hollywood. It's shitty to admit out loud — and I don't say it to justify what I went through — but given the journey and circumstances of my life, I was used to being treated as a sexual object by men — this one just happened to be famous.  Despite multiple uncomfortable experiences with Jeffrey, it has been an incredible, career-solidifying honor to bring life to my character Shea on Amazon's Transparent. Working on the award-winning series as a low-income trans woman with active roots in New York's ball culture is a rare opportunity most of my sisters are not given.  My hope is that Amazon can find the good in this, and use this as an opportunity, a teachable moment to re-center the other trans characters in this show with the family members instead of just pulling it. Let our brilliant writers continue to craft something that is entertaining and creates a social change the way they know how. Don't let the trans community suffer for the actions of one cis male actor. Transparent has been a guiding light in the industry, by employing more trans people in Hollywood than any other production in history, which made it even more difficult to speak out. As trans-women and survivors we have often felt we never had the power of the voice to speak out on our personal and collective pain. I am so proud of my work on Transparent and its ""trans-affirmative action"" mission, as coined by its creator Jill Soloway. And I call on Amazon to make another bold affirmative move to our communities: Remove the problem and let the show go on. It's vital that the show's creator, showrunner and its studio re-center the narrative of Transparent on the experiences of the other trans characters and family members audiences have grown to love on the series.",1
"Stormi has stopped the world from turning, and here's what the name actually means.  Kylie Jenner has officially announced the name of her daughter as Stormi, and the internet can’t get enough.  From references to the weather (“There’s expected to be Stormi weather and Reign over Chicago this weekend,” read one tweet) and questions over any hidden meanings (a link to butterflies, perhaps?), fans are pouring over the name for every possible meaning.  Here, we’ve rounded up five things to know about the name Stormi—because we know you want to know everything, naturally.  The name Stormi (as you may have guessed) has an Old English origin and stems from the word ‘Storm’—describing temperament or a weather pattern. It’s often associated with moody and mysterious characters. The name peaked in popularity in the early 1990s, with data on Think Baby Names showing an increase in popularity for the name around 1992, before dropping off closer to the millennium. No doubt baby Stormi will revisit the public conscious now that it’s got the Jenner stamp of approval. There are a number of famous celebrities called Stormi, including Stormi Bree Henley, an American model and partner of Lucky Blue Smith, but most are spelt Stormy (with the y). A number of references to storms can be seen throughout music history, including Stormy Monday by TB Walker and Stormy, by Classics IV. Although none mention any Kardashian/Jenner babies, we’ve got no doubt Travis Scott will be dropping a song (or two) about stormy weather very soon. Baby Stormi’s full name isn’t yet confirmed, but as Travis Scott’s real name is actually Jacques Webster, fans are deciding she will be named Stormi Webster. Others are saying Stormi is just it—no last name—and others are saying Jenner will hyphenate for what might be the most famous double-barreled name of the 2020s.  A fan of the name of not, there’s no doubt Kylie Jenner gets us all talking.",1

"Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump’s daughter, is closing her namesake fashion brand and planning a longer-term focus on policy in Washington.  Ms. Trump, who formally separated herself from the business more than a year ago, holds an undefined policy portfolio as a senior adviser in the White House, most recently centered on workforce development. Her decision to concentrate on the White House comes after months of speculation about whether she and her husband, fellow White House adviser Jared Kushner, would remain in the administration for the rest of Mr. Trump’s term.  Apparel sales at the brand, which Ms. Trump launched in its current form in 2014, soared in the year of the 2016 presidential election. But the company also became a lightning rod for critics of her father’s policies, with one anti-Trump group last year urging shoppers to boycott stores selling Trump-branded goods. Retailers including Nordstrom Inc. and Hudson’s Bay have stopped selling Ivanka Trump products in the past 18 months, citing poor sales.  Abigail Klem, who took over as president of the New York-based brand in the spring of 2017, told its 18 employees Tuesday the company would be shutting down. Ms. Trump addressed the staff in person later in the day.  Ms. Trump said she had contemplated the move in recent months as she grew frustrated by the restrictions she placed on the company, IT Collection LLC, to avoid possible conflicts of interest while serving in the White House.  Visitors at the Ivanka Trump Collection store at Trump Tower in New York in 2017. Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News  Ms. Trump said Tuesday she was uncertain whether she would return to the retail industry once she leaves Washington.  “After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington,” she said. “So making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.”  When Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner moved to Washington from New York in late 2016 to join the administration, it was unclear how long they would stay. Mr. Kushner initially took on an expansive portfolio that included China relations, Middle East peace and improving the federal government’s efficiency. Ms. Trump made an early focus pushing to include a child-care tax credit in a federal tax overhaul.  Since then, the couple has faced questions about their roles at the White House and their companies’ financial dealings. Mr. Kushner was drawn into the special-counsel investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Kushner and the president have denied collusion, and Moscow has denied election meddling.  Ms. Trump also drew rebukes for at times appearing to hawk her brand in her official capacity, including by wearing the merchandise in Instagram posts about official appearances.  Mr. Trump has often privately expressed concern about the couple and has suggested they would be happier in New York, according to people familiar with the discussions.  Ms. Trump has focused in recent months on promoting the White House’s infrastructure plan, which the administration has since declared dead, and workforce development, holding an event last week with lawmakers and corporate executives at the White House and making a presentation at a cabinet meeting.  There are signs the couple are easing into their lives in Washington. They have routinely hosted members of Congress and reporters at their home in the city’s upscale Kalorama neighborhood for dinner parties and off-the-record conversations. In recent months, they have been house-hunting for a permanent home in the city, according to people familiar with the matter.  Ms. Trump separated herself from the management and operations of the company but retained her ownership interest through a trust. The ethics restrictions she implemented included ordering the company not to expand internationally and to seek her approval before striking agreements with new domestic partners.  The Ivanka Trump brand sells moderately priced apparel, shoes, handbags and jewelry, such as a $200 pink handbag and $100 black pumps.  In January 2017, the company said it wouldn’t proceed with a distribution deal with Sanei International that would bring the brand to Japan after learning that Sanei had ties to the Japanese government, according to a letter from Ms. Klem to the House Judiciary Committee.  Ms. Trump has frequently worn her brand in public and at White House events. Photo: Evan Vucci/Associated Press  The Ivanka Trump brand will allow its licensing agreements with companies including G-III Apparel Group Ltd. , its apparel distribution partner, to expire in the coming months, according to a person close to the company, but will continue to file trademark applications in certain instances. “There’s a responsibility to Ivanka to ensure that others are not exploiting her name,” the person said.  Despite Ms. Trump’s efforts to separate herself from the company, it has proved difficult to fully extricate the brand from her father’s administration.  After Nordstrom dropped Ms. Trump’s line last year, the president in a tweet chastised the company for treating his daughter “so unfairly.” Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was later rebuked for urging the public to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff” in a televised interview from the White House briefing room.  At the time, a Nordstrom spokeswoman said sales had deteriorated to the point where “it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line.”  Neiman Marcus Group and T.J. Maxx in the last 18 months have scaled back or changed the way they display Ivanka Trump products.  Hudson’s Bay, a Canadian company, notified the Ivanka Trump brand in the fall of 2017 that it would phase out its merchandise, based on its performance, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Lord & Taylor and Saks Off 5th, also owned by Hudson’s Bay Co. , continue to carry the line, according to a Hudson’s Bay spokeswoman. Other retailers selling the line included Dillard’s Inc., Bloomingdale’s Inc., Zappos.com, Amazon.com Inc. and Von Maur Inc.  An Ivanka Trump spokeswoman said the brand launched its e-commerce operation earlier this year in light of shifts in retail patterns across the industry.  Newsletter Sign-up  The business is privately held and doesn’t disclose sales or other financial information. Online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand sold at Amazon.com, Macy’s Inc., Bloomingdale’s and Zappos.com fell nearly 55% in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.  An Ivanka Trump spokesman attributed the decline to particularly high online sales in early 2017 because of “newfound awareness” of the brand after Mr. Trump took office.  During the 2016 election, the brand saw its apparel sales boom. In the year ended Jan. 31, 2017, net sales of Ivanka Trump-licensed apparel rose 61% to $47.3 million from the prior year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from G-III. Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of G-III, said Tuesday the company was “appreciative” of its partnership with Ivanka Trump.  In the White House, Ms. Trump continued to receive certain financial information and a share of the company’s profits. The financial disclosure form she filed in June showed the trust was valued at over $50 million and brought in more than $5 million in income in 2017.  Ms. Klem said in an interview that she was “incredibly proud” of the brand. “I know that this was a very difficult decision for Ivanka and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have led such a talented and committed team,” she said.  Ms. Trump said in a CBS interview shortly after joining the administration that she hadn’t sold the company because of its name. A sale would have allowed whoever bought the brand to go around the globe, she said, “licensing and leveraging the name of the 45th president of the United States of America—completely unfettered.”  Corrections & Amplifications  Online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand sold at Amazon.com, Macy’s Inc., Bloomingdale’s and Zappos.com fell nearly 55% in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.

"An 11-year-old from Texas wowed the crowd—and Idina Menzel—during her July 30 concert when the Frozen singer and actress asked for volunteers to sing with her.  In a YouTube video capturing the magic, Luke, the preteen with impressive pipes, is seen immediately called upon by Menzel and is clearly the only boy in a crowd of girls.  Though Menzel said boys usually tell her they don’t like “Let It Go” and prefer Justin Timberlake’s track from the movie Trolls, Luke couldn’t have been more in opposition.  “Heck to the no,” he replied, shaking his head in disbelief. “I’m offended.”  When it came time to sing the song, it only took a few bars for Menzel and the crowd to realize that he wasn’t just a fan but a full-fledged musician himself.      Menzel offered to let Luke sing a different song since the crowd cheered through his first performance, but he chose to sing through the chorus again, adding in extra frills that even the most shameless of shower singers would be embarrassed to try aloud. Luke even got to wrap up the segment with Menzel, all by himself.  “I can’t sing it like that,” Menzel told the girls on the stage. “I’m gonna try tomorrow, I’m so inspired.”  Luke told news station WFAA 8 that he’d never received a standing ovation before, but he’s already ready for his next performance.  “I know boys don’t like ‘Let It Go’ because it’s a ‘girls’ song,’” Luke said, rolling his eyes. “But I mean, songs are for everyone. It’s music, it’s art.”  Watch Luke’s entire stint with Menzel below:",1
"Demure: Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended London Modest Fashion Week in the capital on Sunday(Source: aidijuma - Instagram)  She sparked rumours she had converted to Islam when she changed her Instagram bio to 'Alaikum salam' in January, which translates to 'and unto you peace' in Arabic.  And Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended a London Modest Fashion Week event in the capital on Sunday.  The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines.  Letting a glimpse of her trademark flame hair shine through, the head piece perfectly framed her pretty face, accentuated by a touch of lipgloss and eyebrow pencil.  She teamed it with a black bomber jacket and black trousers as she stopped to check out the cosmetics.  The actress was seen posing with excited fans at the event, before making a quiet exit.  Sharing a snap of the actress with their goodie bag, a beauty brand from the event later wrote: 'She was so lovely and was saying how she's into halal cosmetics and what she’s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!'

Modest: The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines  London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, showcasing the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines.  The second installment of the two-day event, held at Victoria House, Bloomsbury, saw models parading down the runway in demure clothing.  Running alongside London Fashion week, the event, which charges up to £200 for tickets, features shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops - including a 'sharia legal hub'.  More than 40 designers from around the world showcased scarves, hijabs and loose-fitting maxi dresses at the annual style showcase organised by Haute Elan, who say 'modest fashion' is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets.  In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.'  A new angle: London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, running alongside London Fashion week  The Arabic greeting translates to 'and unto you peace,' and many took it mean that Lohan was converting to the Muslim faith.  Lohan has not revealed however if she is in fact converting to the faith, and a rep for the actress did not respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.  There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn.  When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends.  'My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,' said Lohan.  Rare picture: In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.' (seen in her latest new Instagram post)  'It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am.'  She said however that she was attacked after that picture was released in the media.  'They crucified me for it in America. They made me seem like Satan. I was a bad person for holding that Quran,' said Lohan.  She said that she was then happy to leave and return to London because she felt unsafe in [her] country.  Lohan spent time in October of last year visiting child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed over into Turkey.  She told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before of after the start of the new year.  'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan,  'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.'  She then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.'  Just a few days before her account was wiped clean in January 2017, Lindsay had shared a poem in which she said she wanted to 'fix ISIS minds'.  'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went.  'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain.  'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older.....  'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds.  'Still and son on, i cannot help but want to fix all of these idle isis minds because, there has to be something i can figure out.  'Rather than living in a world of fear and doubt, they now shoot, we used to shout  'If only i can keep trying to fix it all, i would keep the world living loving and small. 'I would share my smiles and give too Many kisses.'",0

"(CNN) Olympic gold-winning gymnast Aly Raisman has filed a lawsuit against the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, disgraced doctor Larry Nassar and others, alleging the committee at its highest levels was aware that Nassar had molested gymnasts who participated with USA Gymnastics.  The suit was filed Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California.  According to the complaint, Nassar, the former doctor for Michigan State University athletics and the national gymnastics team, sexually abused Raisman at the Karolyi Ranch in Texas, national and international competitions and the 2012 London Olympics.  Raisman is a two-time Olympian who won medals in London and Rio de Janeiro, including team gold in each of those Games.  ""My highest priority has been to push for change, so future generations of athletes will be safer,"" Raisman said in a statement. ""It has become painfully clear that these organizations have no intention of properly addressing this problem. After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented.  ""Meanwhile, thousands of young athletes continue to train and compete every day in this same broken system. I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.""  In a statement, Raisman's attorney, John Manly, accused the USOC and USA Gymnastics of ""a conspiracy to silence victims and cover up the largest child sex abuse scandal in history.""  ""A simple fact is this: If USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee had followed their own bylaws, policies and procedures designed to protect children from sexual abuse, Ms. Raisman never would have met him, never would have been 'treated' by him and never would have been molested by him,"" Manly said.  ""Instead they conspired to hide their knowledge of Nassar's horrible crimes from the public and attempted to frighten Ms. Raisman and other victims into keeping quiet. USOC and USAG can and will be made accountable by our justice system.""  USA Gymnastics declined to comment on Raisman's lawsuit Friday but offered support to athletes who have been abused by Nassar. ""USA Gymnastics is committed to doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again by making bold decisions and holding ourselves to the highest standards of care,"" it said in a statement.  CNN also reached out to the US Olympic Committee for comment. Previously, USA Gymnastics, the Olympic Committee and Michigan State have denied wrongdoing in the Nassar scandal.  USA Gymnastics terminated its agreemen t with the Karolyi Ranch in January. Marta and Bela Karolyi, longtime gymnastics coaches for Team USA, are retired.  Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in two state court cases in Michigan. He's in prison in Tucson, Arizona, serving a 60-year sentence for the federal charges.  If he's still alive when he finishes his federal sentence, Nassar will have to return to Michigan to serve sentences for sex crimes. He was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in Eaton County, Michigan, where nearly 200 girls and women made statements about how his sexual abuse had changed their lives.  That sentence will run concurrently with the 40- to 175-year sentence from nearby Ingham County. In the latter case, Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct -- three of which involved victims under age 13 -- and admitted to using his stature as a medical professional to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment.  First male gymnast joins suit against Nassar  Separately, the first male gymnast has joined a civil federal suit against Nassar and others associated with the sex abuse scandal of the former Michigan State and USA Gymnastics doctor.  Filed Wednesday, the complaint alleges Jacob Moore was treated multiple times by Nassar in a Twistars gym, at the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic and in Nassar's home. It was there, according to the suit, that Nassar ""pulled down Plaintiff Jacob Moore's pants, exposing his genitalia, explaining to Jacob Moore that he was doing this to treat his shoulder pain through acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia.""  Moore was a minor at the time, and this was done after another minor female gymnast came into the basement where he was being treated, the suit says.  ""There is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male's genitalia,"" the suit says. ""Plaintiff Jacob Moore believes the conduct of Dr. Nassar was sexual assault, battery, abuse, molestation and harassment performed by Defendant Nassar for Defendant Nassar's sexual pleasure and gratification.""  Moore's sister, Kamerin, a member of USA Gymnastics from 2003-2014, first testified about her and her brother's victimization during Nassar's criminal trial in Ingham County in January. She also joined the federal civil suit.  Jacob Moore has been a member of USA Gymnastics since 2006 and trained at the Twistars gym from 2001 through 2015.  The allegations were made in an amended civil federal complaint filed against Nassar. Defendants include Michigan State, the university's board of trustees, USA Gymnastics and others associated with the scandal. USA Gymnastics also declined to comment on Moore's complaint.  The suit, which has several other plaintiffs, seeks declaratory, injunctive, equitable and monetary relief for injuries.",1

Tributes continued to pour in from around the world for the pop superstar, who died after being found collapsed in a lift at his home in Minnesota.

"Shannon Beador has been 'blindsided' by her estranged husband David's new relationship.  David has gone public on Instagram with new girlfriend Lesley, who he reportedly started dating in December, just two months after Shannon announced their separation after 17 years of marriage.

'David wasted no time and has already started dating again and has moved on entirely,' an insider told E! News at the time.  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized' a source told People  Falling apart: Shannon, 53, shared this inspirational quote to Instagram last week  'He’s been seeing this woman for at least a few weeks now and the word has spread around Newport Beach.'

Last week the mother-of-three shared an inspirational quote to Instagram which read: 'Sometimes when things are falling apart they may actually be falling into place.'  According to Page Six Shannon is requesting spousal support and attorneys' fees to be paid by David.  The star is also asking for sole physical custody of their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody.  Shannon has requested David be granted child visitation.  She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.

But still there were problems.  During the season 12 reunion show of RHOC she broke down in tears when she said it was David, not her, who wanted the marriage to end.

She added: ""So, when I'm finished filming (British sitcom) 'Sick Note' I can go back to Dubai, start the lipstick, discuss that and then design this island, Lohan Island.""  The 31-year-old former Disney star went on joking that she was ""out-Trumping Trump with the name Lohan!"" Donald Trump is known for branding developments with his name.

"Aww! Robert Pattison was cracking up like the rest of us at Kristen Stewart’s hilarious opening monologue on ‘Saturday Night Live.’ HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVE details on on how he loved being included in her jokes that had the audience in stitches.  Yo go girl! Kristen Stewart absolutely crushed it at comedy when she hosted Saturday Night Live Feb. 4, and her ex Robert Pattinson, 30, is giving her big applause. She mentioned him in jokes for her opening monologue and not only was he totally okay with it, he’s thrilled that she did it! “Rob saws snippets from the show and absolutely loved Kristen’s opening monologue. He thought she was hilarious. He was happy to see her having so much fun and being so at ease with herself,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  K-Stew kicked off her opening bit by reminding the audience how Donald Trump, 70, lost it on Twitter when she cheated on her Twilight co-star back in 2012. “Four years ago I was dating this guy named Robert and we broke up and got back together and for some reason it made Donald Trump go insane,” she joked. She went on to read an actual tweet that our new president put up, where he ranted that she “cheated on him like a dog” and that he shouldn’t take her back. It is so unbelievable to think that the leader of the free world once got involved in a Twitter rage about Kristen’s love life, and that wasn’t lost on her.  Kristin reminded us that our ranter-in-chief tweeted a total of 11 times about their romance drama, including “Everyone knows that I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart.” She got huge laughs when she said that Donald was totally in love with her former boyfriend and that if he didn’t like her back then, he wouldn’t like her now cause “I’m like so gay, dude.” Oddly enough, for once Donald didn’t hop on his Twitter account and respond. After Kristen totally schooled him, it was probably best to keep quiet.  HollywoodLifers, what did you think of Kristen on SNL? Did you have any idea that she could be so funny?",0
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  Reese Witherspoon and Ellen DeGeneres love Oprah Winfrey, just like the rest of us.  However, unlike the rest of us, they're actually friends with the former talk-show host and media titan. And while that may sound like something to brag about to you and me, it sparked a battle on Thursday's ""Ellen DeGeneres Show.""  The problem? It's great to be her friend, but it's even better to be her best friend — and there can be only one, evidently.  ""(Reese) somehow claims that just because she was in that movie ('A Wrinkle in Time') with you that she's your best friend,"" DeGeneres noted, having made a similar claim concerning her own closeness to Winfrey.  But all of that talk simply left Oprah wondering, ""Why do we have to have a better or a best?""  Meanwhile DeGeneres preferred to focus on her own question: Who deserves the coveted BFF title?  Michael Rozman/ Warner Bros.  To settle the matter once and for all, the host brought out Witherspoon for an Oprah Winfrey trivia showdown. Whoever could answer the most Oprah-related tidbits correctly — such as what her fellow high school students voted her ""most likely to ..."" or her secret ingredient to a great margarita — would win.  Alas, they got both of those questions wrong. The answers were ""most popular"" and ""fresh-squeezed limes,"" respectively.  ""So far, I have no friends,"" Winfrey quipped. ""I have none.""  Not so!  Before the bid was over, Witherspoon and DeGeneres managed to get a couple of answers right, with DeGeneres taking the lead by one — thanks, in part, to the fact that she knew which 1990s sitcom Oprah played a therapist on; It was none other than ""Ellen.""  Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.  There you have it; DeGeneres is officially Winfrey's BFF!  Although we have a feeling Gayle King might have something to say about.",1
"Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift's years-long friendship all started when they were dating Jonas brothers in the late '00s. Selena dated Nick from 2008 to 2010, while Taylor dated Joe in 2008—but was notoriously dumped in a phone call months later. Although those relationships didn't last, the one between Selena and Taylor remains stronger than ever.  ""We actually dated the Jonas Brothers together! It was hysterical,"" Gomez recalled her first time meeting Swift in a new radio interview with KIIS FM UK.  ""It was amazing, because she was the girl with the big curly hair and all the bracelets and the cowboy boots. And I was definitely up-and-coming, and we just clicked,"" she added. ""It was the best thing we got out of those relationships.""  They still keep in touch with the Jonases, however. ""They're lovely, by the way,"" Gomez said. ""We're all friends now. We were young, you know. It's a different time.""  This isn't Gomez's first time opening up about her and Swift's friendship. In March 2016, she said of her fellow star: ""I've known her for 10 years, she's been one of my best friends through thick and thin, walked by my side.""  She added that Swift is ""known for embracing her personal story and creating a beautiful thing out of it, and I was a little hesitant with that—and she was always the person to encourage me to tell my story and be proud of who I am.""  Swift showed the feeling was mutual while speaking to E! in May 2014. ""Both of us have kind of stuck it out and hung in there through all the different changes we've gone through,"" she said. The singer added that their friendship is ""the longest one I think either of us have had.""  Selena and Taylor made their first red carpet appearance together in 2008, at the Another Cinderella Story premiere:    Getty Images  And here they are at their latest red carpet appearance, at the 2016 Grammy Awards:  Getty Images  As the superstars continue to promote their new music, we're sure we'll be seeing a lot more joint appearances from them in the near future.",1
"Romance rumors are flying around Stranger Things stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer once again. This isn’t the first time the two have made fans wonder about their relationship; the IRL Nancy and Jonathan, who had crushes on each other in the show, have been rumored to be dating since early 2017, but still haven’t confirmed it.  Over the weekend, photographers snapped Charlie and Natalia holding hands on a leisurely stroll together in Paris. They shared a pair of earbuds and were also spotted with Charlie’s arm comfortably around Natalia’s shoulders. A cozy autumn walk around Paris is looking pretty good right now.  Holding hands obviously does not equal relationship, but fans are still thrilled about a possible pairing between the two stars.  Since the Stranger Things cast has faced so much publicity lately, we totally understand why Charlie and Natalia would want to keep a prospective romance quiet, and it’s totally their right to do so. Either way, a vacation in Paris doesn't sound too bad!  Related: “Stranger Things” Actor Charlie Heaton Has a Lookalike In Harry Styles",1

"Postby Guest » Thu Apr 05, 2018 9:48 am  Jennifer Aniston is feeling relieved that she’s friends with ex-husband Brad Pitt again after being angry at him for years. Will their friendship lead to a risky rekindled romance? Get the EXCLUSIVE details!    Jennifer Aniston, 49, is a single woman again after separating from husband Justin Theroux, 46, and that means she’s free to be friendly and even flirt with whoever she wants, including ex Brad Pitt, 54! The talented actress has recently become friends with the newly single Brad again after years of not being in touch and although she’s thrilled about the reconciliation, friends are hoping she’ll steer clear so her heart doesn’t get broken by her former love. “Jennifer is psyched that she and Brad are friends again,” a friend of Jennifer’s EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “For years she was so angry at him, it’s a relief to have that all be water under the bridge. But not a lot of people in her life are encouraging the friendship, the fear of course is that she’ll fall for him again and he’ll break her heart all over again. It makes sense they’d be worried, Brad’s her kryptonite.”    Although Jen and Brad haven’t been together since 2005, the former Friends funny lady still thinks he’s the most attractive man she’s ever been with. “A few weeks ago at a dinner party in L.A., she admitted that she still thinks he’s the hottest man she’s ever been with,” the friend continued. “Her attraction to him is still alive and well. At this point they’re still in the early stages of rekindling a friendship but there’s always been an undeniable chemistry between them. Nothing romantic has happened yet but who knows what could happen down the line, anything is possible.”    We have to admit that although a rekindled romance may be risky for these two, the fact that they’ve been able to put their rocky past behind them and be on good terms is totally amazing! We’re getting serious nostalgia from the former lovebirds and it will be interesting to see how things progress from here. No matter what, though, we wish both Jen and Brad all the happiness in the world!",0

Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  “It is true that I have been reprimanded twice during this past season of Lethal Weapon. The first reprimand was because I reacted with anger over working conditions that did not feel safe or conducive to good work under the leadership of a guest director and assistant director who, in turn, were angry at my response. I met with Human Resources, I apologized for my part of the conflict, and I completed studio-appointed therapy. I even shared a sizable portion of my paycheck with one of the parties involved per the instruction of the studio,” Crawford began.  Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford FOX via Getty  He wrote about the second incident that took place on the set of the drama series: “The second reprimand came during an episode I was directing. An actor on set felt unsafe because a piece of shrapnel from an effect hit him. It was an unfortunate event that happened in spite of all safety precautions and procedures being followed. I take responsibility for the incident because I was in charge of the set.”  Damon Wayans, Clayne Crawford Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic  The actor continued by sharing that he has absolute “love, respect and care for my crew and cast, and would never intentionally jeopardize so many jobs. Moreover, I love the process of making film and television. I appreciate and respect the work of everyone involved. It takes a village. I am incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts.”  “Furthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention Lethal Weapon is receiving because of these incidents,” continued Crawford, who said that he takes “great pride in treating everyone in life with dignity and kindness.”  Wait, wait, wait……you can’t fire me on my day off! — Clayne Crawford (@ClayneCrawford) May 8, 2018  Last week, Entertainment Weekly confirmed a report from The Hollywood Reporter that stated Fox and its studio partner Warner Bros.

Crawford seemingly responded on Twitter Tuesday by first sharing a photo of himself on a boat with his arms up and the caption, “Hmmmmmm?” and then tweeting, “Wait, wait, wait……you can’t fire me on my day off!”  Seann William Scott was hired to replace Crawford as Riggs’ brother, according to Variety.",1
"New baby, new ‘do.  In a new selfie shared on Instagram Thursday, July 26, the 34-year-old debuted a short new bob in celebration of hitting her post-baby goal weight. Quoting brother-in-law Kanye West , Khloé captioned the sultry snap, “ Not smiling makes me smile .”  Three months after welcoming her first child, True Thompson , the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has given herself a bit of a mommy makeover by chopping off her long tresses.  Advertisement  The Revenge Body host also shared a picture of her new ‘do while ringing in grandmother Mary Jo “MJ” Houghton’s 84th birthday. Giving a kissy face to the camera, she wrote alongside the cute family portrait, “Happy Birthday my sweet MJ!!”  Previously, Khloé told fans she wasn’t going to cut her hair until she lost most of the weight she gained during pregnancy. When a fan tweeted a picture of the Good American denim designer with a lob — aka a long bob — hairstyle, saying the look “was everything,” she replied that she had immediate plans to snip off her blonde locks as soon as she was comfortable with her weight.  “Short hair is my favorite!! But I still need to lose a few more pounds and then I’ll cut it again,” she wrote on Twitter.  According to Khloé, she’s lost more than 30 pounds since giving birth to her daughter.",1
"Lest the Kardashians have pulled the greatest troll job on celebrity media since that time Joaquin Phoenix pretended to be a rapper, its safe to assume that Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are both pregnant , and have been for some time. Yet, the close-knit clan has stubbornly refused to confirm this. Like most open secrets, it's become almost frustrating. More frustrating than those two friends in your circle that everyone knows are secretly dating but refuse to admit it. More frustrating than knowing someone is throwing you a surprise birthday party but not knowing the exact details. More frustrating even than when someone you know keeps saying they're staying out of politics, but occasionally makes vague Facebook status that makes you think they're a secret Trump supporter. Yes, more frustrating than even that.  In the process, though, the Kardashian-Jenners have turned the presumably inevitable announcement and their surrounding anticipation into events on their own. It's not even a question of ""if"" that's interesting anymore, but rather ""how"" and ""when.... no seriously when? We're all waiting. There's a lot going on in the world right now. We have better things to think about.""  Well, at least one confirmation may be coming our way sometime sort of soon, if the latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians is any indication. The trailer begins with Kris Jenner (in that blonde wig ) and her three eldest daughters sitting around a table and presumably all cosplaying as powerful female crime lords, as Kris proposes, ""Let's raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner."" Then they run through matters of Rob's whole situation with Blac Chyna, Kendall's anxiety issues, and a tarantula before we get to someone murmuring the phrase, ""Did you guys hear what's on TMZ?"" Then Kourtney says, ""I'm so sick of people like not saying anything."" (Yeah, us too.) Eventually, though, we wind up at a party where there's tears of joy and everyone is hugging Khloe. It definitely seems like a pregnancy announcement situation.  So, perhaps that's how the Khloé konfirmation goes down, almost as we all should have expected it, during a super-hyped episode of the family's show.  That leaves the matter of Kylie, who, save for some iPhone-shot footage, is as conspicuously absent from the preview as the part of her body below her neck is from her Snapchats. Some fans have theories about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Kim is currently teasing the family's Christmas card shoot on Instagram in a sort of 25 day long digital advent calendar: Khloé made her first full appearance today, but Kylie has been missing. Might she and her baby bump appear on day 25? Or could she too be waiting to reveal her news on the show?  Here's another curious matter to consider when mulling the timing: the trailer in question is for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year. So we may make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either. What's another few weeks at this point? Then again, what's the point of calling the show Keeping Up With The Kardashians if we're all way ahead of it anyway?  Either way, the've managed to keep attention on this mystery for far longer than they should have. As they say in the trailer, ""Let's raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner!""

"Lucky the Leprechaun is getting another magical friend.  General Mills has announced it will be adding a new marshmallow to Lucky Charms — a unicorn. It’s the first substantial change to the cereal in roughly 10 years.  The unicorn, which will replace the hourglass marshmallow, was chosen after the company solicited suggestions on social media. And while Lucky Charms have been increasingly popular with adults in recent years, it was ultimately the suggestions of children that stood out.  “We decided to introduce a new charm with the help of the keepers of magic themselves — kids,” Josh DeWitt, marketing manager of Lucky Charms, said in a press release. “They spoke, and after hearing their love for the magical unicorn, we listened.”  Kids weren’t the only ones excited about the addition, though.

"Emma Watson and boyfriend William “Mack” Knight have split after dating for nearly two years, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.  A source confirms to Us that the pair went their separate ways earlier this year and were last seen together on May 25. When asked, her rep told Us, “I’m afraid I don’t comment on my client’s personal life.”  The Harry Potter star, 27, and Knight, 37, were first spotted together in October 2015, taking in the Broadway musical Hamilton.  Like Watson, who’s a graduate of Brown University, Knight has an Ivy League education, graduating from Princeton in 2003 with a Bachelor’s in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, he got an MBA from Columbia Business School six years ago.  Emma Watson’s Harry Potter Premiere Style Evolution  The Beauty and the Beast actress was protective of their relationship, avoiding talking about her business manager boyfriend in interviews.  In February this year she told Vanity Fair that she no longer takes photos with fans, in order to avoid giving out “tracking data” of where she is and what she’s wearing, and explained that keeping her private life under wraps is part of the way she deals with her worldwide fame.  Emma Watson’s Style Evolution: How She’s Grown Up  “I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways,” she said. “I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus.

"ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.",0

"Kim Zolciak-Biermann is preparing to go under the knife — again.  The Don’t Be Tardy star revealed Wednesday that she’s planning to get smaller breast implants after she asked her fans to cast their votes in a poll on what size they think she should reduce to.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Which one,” Zolciak-Biermann, 40, wrote in an Instagram Story with two implant size options: “Full C [or] DD.”  Kim Zolciack Biermann/Instagram  “Thx @kanebiermann for taking this pic of me today!!” the mother of six captioned a photo — snapped by her 4-year-old son, Kane — of herself wearing a strapless red bikini while standing beside a swimming pool.  “Lopsided boobs and all (clearly it’s the bathing suit lol) 😂🤣” she wrote. “But thanks you guys for voting on C/DD can’t wait to downsize a little @dr.hochstein 💃🏼💃🏼”    During her House of Kim podcast on Wednesday, Zolciak-Biermann opened up about her decision to go smaller.  “I obviously have implants. I have the largest implants they actually make, but it doesn’t look that big on my body because of just the way I’m built,” she shared. “But, I’m thinking about actually getting my boobs reduced.”  “I already called Dr. Hochstein, who did my boobs and tummy a few years ago — he did my hernia repair and my tummy tuck after that, you might as well! And I said, ‘You know, I feel like I should get my boobs reduced. They’re heavy, my posture’s terrible, I’m getting older.’ What do you guys think?”  “I was thinking of going from like a DD to like a C. So head on over to my Instagram please and vote: DD or C,” she said. “I’ve actually already had my surgery scheduled in a couple months, but I can always change that.”  “I had a lift and I have like the nicest boobs ever. I did breastfeed all of my kids, so ladies, let’s be honest, they were stretched out, loss of volume, pancake nipples,” she explained. “So [Dr. Hochstein] gave me back my 18-year-old chest, which was amazing. He’s the best for that you guys.”  “So anyways, let me know. I’m thinking like a C, a full C. I have to have all my clothes altered. I have to buy a size 6 in everything when I could wear a size 2 in tops because of my boobs and then have everything altered. So it’d be nice to just be able to wear something. They’re perky because I had a lift, so it’s not really that, it’s just the weight of them,” said Zolciak-Biermann  RELATED VIDEO: Kelly Dodd Opens Up About Cosmetic Procedures: “No Pain, No Gain!”  The Bravo star has been very open about her relationship with plastic surgery in the past, including documenting her breast augmentation on her Bravo reality show.  “I will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so” Zolciak-Biermann told E! News in 2016. “I’m open about it. I don’t care. You only go around one time, and I especially understand that.”  “I had a boob job and I’ve had a hernia fixed,” Zolciak-Biermann explained. “I had a pretty big hernia from the twins, so I said just do a tummy tuck, which is kinda the same thing, just make the skin really tight. But that doesn’t change my size. I’m the same size I was the day I walked into surgery, I’m just a little bit tighter looking.”  At the time, she also explained that her tiny frame runs in the family.  “A lot is genetics,” she said. “My mom’s very small, I’m tall, I’m 5-8, I do have height on me. My mom is 5-4. But my mom’s been a size 2 her whole life. I’ve been a size 27 jean my whole life.”",1
"Like many people who live life in the public eye, Anne Hathaway is no stranger to internet hate. Now, the actress is taking preemptive action against haters and trolls as she bulks up in preparation for an upcoming film role.  ""I am gaining weight for a movie role and it is going well,"" Hathaway captioned a video highlighting her impressive (and tiring) new exercise routine. ""To all the people who are going to fat shame me in the upcoming months, it’s not me, it’s you.""  The video is sped up and shows what appears to be a very long and grueling workout, which Hathaway takes like a champ.  ""I wanted to set this to Queen’s 'Fat Bottomed Girls' but copyright said no. Continued peace,"" she added at the end of her caption.  Hathaway didn't specify which film she is gaining weight for, but her reported upcoming projects include the sci-fi thriller O2, an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel The Last Thing He Wanted, and a remake of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Rebel Wilson.",1

"Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye “plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.""  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the ""Netflix and Chill Act?"" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says ""Kim is doing okay despite reports.""  ""She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,"" the source continued. ""She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.""  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .",0

"Kim Kardashian is having issues with using a surrogate. A source close to Kim EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that she’s feeling ‘powerless and not in control.’  Kim Kardashian, 37, is feeling helpless with the process of using a surrogate for her third pregnancy. A source close to Kim EXCLUSIVELY told us that Kim is feeling anxious about having the pregnancy out of her hands. “Kim is nervous about her surrogate birthing her baby,” our source said. “Kim has never felt more powerless and not in control of a situation. She has worked so hard to bring another child into the world for her family and the anxiety of the labor process is starting to get to Kim. The entire experience is new for Kim and it is all of the unknowns that are making her fearful.”  According to our source, Kim is still coming to terms with the fact she won’t be the one giving birth to her third child. “With the pregnancy reaching term and the birth coming soon, Kim is realizing how much she is depending on others for everything to go smoothly, especially her surrogate,” our source added. “Kim is struggling to cope with not being the one delivering her own child. She is doing her best to trust her surrogate and that her team of doctors will all do their best to deliver her baby safely into the world.” We reported earlier how Kim revealed she had a miscarriage before deciding to use a surrogate.  While she’s reportedly “depending” on her surrogate, she hasn’t invited her to the Kardashians’ holiday celebrations, an insider told us. However, it’s all about keeping healthy boundaries between the two of them. Check out these pics of celebs, including Kim, who showed off their bikini bods in the snow.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kim will move past her feelings of powerlessness to a place where she feels confident and more in control? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.",0
"Well, this is weird. A new report claims that FKA Twigs has been leaning on Robert Pattinson’s ex, Kristen Stewart, for advice about their relationship. Hmm.  Is Kristen Stewart, 26, doling out love advice to her ex’s fiancee? One shocking report claims that FKA Twigs, 28, has been reaching out to the Twilight actress in hopes of figuring out her future husband, Robert Pattinson, 29.  Uh oh. Is there trouble in paradise for the future Mr. and Mrs. Pattinson? Unfortunately, a new report claims that Rob is “off the rails,” and that his fiancee, FKA Twigs, is having trouble reaching him. So, what’s a girl to do? Talk to his ex, obviously!  “Twigs knows that Kristen understands him almost better than anyone,” a source told OK magazine’s May 23 issue. “She thinks it’s worth a shot.” Hopefully, Kristen can help FKA figure out what to do about her man and his alleged troubles. Plus, this isn’t the first time there have been rumors of trouble between the engaged couple. As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, the pair spent her birthday together — but she wasn’t wearing her engagement ring. Awkward.  The report claims that Rob is “very self-destructive” when he’s “not working.” It also claims that FKA has asked Rob to find his chill, but that he’s more or less ignored her and continues “nonstop partying.” Yikes. Maybe reaching out to Kristen wasn’t the worst idea, especially after the three of them had a run-in at the 2016 Met Ball on May 2.  In the meantime, Kristen has been focusing on her own rocky love life. Not only did she reportedly break up with rumored girlfriend Soko before the Met Ball, but she was seen leaving an after party with sexy model Stella Maxwell after the big event. And to make things even more confusing, Kristen fled back to Los Angeles to spend time with her rumored ex, Alicia Cargile, after her night out with Stella. Hmm.  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — Do YOU think Twigs and Kristen are really talking to each other about RPattz? Comment below with your thoughts!",0
"Nearly two years after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, the former power couple have reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for this summer, Us Weekly confirms.  According to court documents obtained by Us, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County determined that “not having a relationship with their father” would be “harmful” to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9. The court said that the kids “are safe with their father” and that it is “critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship” with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.  Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists “to explain the summer schedule,” the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband’s custodial time.  The Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple’s next court hearing on August 13.  In addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with “each of the minor children’s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,” according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.  Jolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, “This [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward. Brad will be wherever he needs to be for the kids.”  A spokesperson for Jolie responded to the release of the custody agreement in a statement to Us on Wednesday, June 13: “This misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children. From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",1

Her candid comments came to light after Piers Morgan revealed the pair had texted each other, after Piers covered the break-up on Good Morning Britain earlier this month. On the show, he said: ""It's always weird when celebrity couples split up saying they have so much love for each other. If they love each other that much, why are they splitting up? They should be more honest and just say, 'We hate each other.'""  In his latest column for the Daily Mail's Event magazine, Piers revealed that Cheryl texted him after the broadcast to share her feelings. ""When we came off air, Cheryl texted me: 'I'm so sorry you didn't like my statement, Piers – perhaps I should have texted you the intimate details in chronological order as it unfolded,'"" the TV star revealed.  Cheryl and Liam's love story through the years:  Loading the player...  Piers added that the pair had ""always got on well"" so he felt a ""sudden rare pang of guilt"" after making the comments. He apologised and Cheryl replied that she was ""only messing"". He continued: ""Fortunately, Cheryl quickly eased my concern: 'I'm just messing. I hate those kinds of statements too, so cringeworthy. But we don't hate each other. It just didn't work out.'""

THEY DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE!!”  The Ritz-Carlton’s official Twitter account expressed their dismay at Jones’ tweet, replying with the following response:  This isn’t the first time that the Ritz-Carlton has been accused of discrimination. In 2015, the North Carolina Attorney General’s office investigated the luxury hotel chain’s Charlotte location for potentially discriminating against Black people by adding a 15 percent surcharge to customers bills during a CIAA conference.  This also isn’t the first time the Saturday Night Live star has publicly expressed her concerns. Last summer, Jones also took to Twitter to express that no designer would dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters, which the comedian starred in.",1
"Khloe Kardashian may be ready to give Tristan Thompson another chance following reports that he cheated on her while she was pregnant with their daughter, True.  On Friday, an insider revealed to US Weekly that Kardashian and Thompson are ""fully back together,"" despite the fact that prior to their daughter's birth, videos and photos of the basketball star visibly cheating on the reality star with at least five different women surfaced back in April.  Now that the two have reportedly decided to move on from the past, the source said that new mom thinks that “the whole world is against Tristan,” and “no one in her world is supporting Tristan and she’s still in love with him.”  According to the source, Kardashian has viewed the photos and videos of her boyfriend with the various other women.  “Those around Khloé are trying to be as supportive to her as they can. It’s hard because if everyone distances themselves from Tristan, they’ll risk losing Khloé,” the insider explained. “Luckily there’s this buffer time. She always planned to stay in Cleveland the first three months. Now with Tristan in the playoffs for possibly another month, no decision needs to be made right now.”  Rumors began to swirl that the couple may have gotten back together after the pair were snapped on Friday, laughing and chatting together at what appeared to be a lunch with friends in Cleveland.  According to TMZ, a week ago Kardashian was said to be ""done"" with her 27-year-old boyfriend and decided to stay in Cleveland for the baby while Thompson travels for the NBA playoffs. But things seemed have changed for the new mom in just a week.  Another source also confirmed to People on Friday that Thompson “is back at the Cleveland house” with Kardashian and their 3-week-old daughter, after it was reported that the basketball player was not allowed in the house following the days of True's birth.  “Khloé seems happy,” the source told People. “She loves being a mom. She’s focused on keeping her family together. She seems okay with Tristan — there’s no talk of a split.”  The news of Kardashian and Thompson's reported reconciliation comes after her family members, Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian, did interviews on ""The Ellen Show"" and commented Thompson's recent cheating allegations.  “It's so f—ed up,"" Kim said of the basketball player's cheating.  In another episode, Jenner explained that her daughter, the new mom, was ""still figuring it out.""  “I’m so proud of that kid. I get choked up because she’s such a good mom, and honestly I get so emotional,” she shared. “I was in Cleveland last week, it was snowing, and she was all nestled in the nursery and the baby. She’s just concentrating on that, just being a mom, her baby and that’s what her sisters are doing as well. She’s so excited about motherhood and trying to get the nursing thing down, which is a little tricky. She’s trying, she’s really trying. That was a little bit tricky when I was there … She’s figuring it out one day at a time, she’s just the best mom already. That baby is so cute, little True.”  Two days ago, Kardashian disabled her comments on her Instagram. The reason for her social media action is unknown.",0
"Blac Chyna is defending herself as a caring mother after she was caught on camera swinging a baby stroller in a public altercation at a Six Flags amusement park on Easter Sunday.  The 29-year-old mother of King Cairo and Dream Kardashian—her children with Tyga and Rob Kardashian, respectively—was seen allegedly getting into an argument at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif. In videos shared on social media, Chyna is seen grabbing a pink stroller and swinging it around wildly. Neither child is seen in the footage, posted by Twitter user AliciaaAngiee.  The Tweets have since been deleted.  An eyewitness told E! News that the incident occurred at 6:45 p.m. at the exit of the X2 ride. It is not clear what incited the incident.  After the videos went viral, Chyna took to Instagram Stories to allude to a person setting her off by trying to touch her child. She did not reference the fight directly but the timing of the post appeared to coincide with the incident. She said she doesn't condone violence but she is a protective mother.  “Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it’s a whole other story,” she said. “I do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost.”  Chyna's new boyfriend, rapper YBN Almighty Jay, allegedly got involved in the altercation and tried to stop it, reports XXL. YBN and security reportedly attempted to restrain Chyna from the unidentified person.  [Photo: Getty Images]",1

"Princess Kate knew what was coming.  Having battled severe pregnancy sickness, or Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), while expecting her first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the royal mom would have been told by her medical team that the odds meant she would likely have the debilitating condition again.  Caitlin Dean, who is chairperson of the U.K.’s Pregnancy Sickness Support, is also a mother of three who suffered from HG in each of her pregnancies.  “A lot of people go into the second [pregnancy] hoping that it will not happen again, thinking [HG] will be one pregnancy and that every pregnancy is different,” says Dean. “But once you have it twice, that delusion is pretty much blown out of the water. So you have to prepare and be ready for this.  “For myself, I found it mentally and physically easier [during subsequent pregnancies] because I knew that I was going to have this and I knew what to expect from the treatment and what to expect generally.”  Lia Toby/WENN  On the flip side, she notes, for some women the symptoms “get worse each time.”  Dean says that for women who have previously battled HG, there’s a trepidation mixed in with the joy of anticipating a new baby.  “You know it’s coming, and it’s quite a scary prospect knowing you’re going to put yourself through that again. Certainly for me and my husband that was a huge decision. Not so much, ‘Let’s have a third kid,’ but, ‘Can we go through HG again?’ It’s certainly something that limits a lot of people who cannot go beyond two because of the condition.  “Preparing makes a huge amount of difference,” she adds. “What we suspect from experience is that if you prepare, you can start pre-emptive treatment and can prepare your household and your finances. The average woman doesn’t have the life that Kate has with people to cook meals and people to do their cleaning for them and look  after their children. For regular women that preparation is absolutely key.”  Such advance preparation, she adds, “doesn’t necessarily improve the sickness, although there is evidence that earlier treatment can reduce the overall impact of the symptoms. It isn’t a cure, but it makes it easier to have done that preparation. Then, if you don’t have HG on the third time, you haven’t lost anything. [That scenario] would be brilliant. Very occasionally women don’t get it again, but most of the time they do.”  Preparing also means keeping your younger children informed, says Dean, who wrote How To Be an HG Hero aimed at children of expectant moms.  Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage  “The idea with that is to help children understand why Mummy’s not in the picture and why she’s potentially in and out of hospital and how they can help,” says Dean. “My key thing is honesty. A lot of people try to hide the fact they’re pregnant in the first 12 weeks, because they’re worried about having to explain a miscarriage if it happens. If you are going in and out of hospital and lying in bed day after day and not telling your kids the reason why, they’re just going to worry about it and make up in their own heads why that is. Kids are resilient and they get on with that as long as you tell them the truth.  “It is debilitating and miserable and hopefully [Kate’s] children will not be worrying about it and understand that Mummy’s poorly.”  Samir Hussein/WireImage  Of course, it’s also tough on moms. “You have the fact that your other children are going to lose out on Mummy, and you have that guilt at not being able to spend so much time with them.”  As for treatment, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include a first line of medication like Cyclizine, which is an anti-histamine and works to combat vomiting, and Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting.  “On top of that, it is IV fluids ­if she’s not keeping food or fluids down,” says Dean, who is not involved in Kate’s treatment. “The main things is to keep her hydrated and able to eat. We know that malnutrition and dehydration can have a negative effect on the fetus. The idea that baby’s fine with a starving mum just isn’t true. It is important to keep mums hydrated so that they can eat as much as they need to or are able to.”",0

"“They’re being so cagey” said The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about Amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eight-Emmy winning comedy series.  She finally confessed backstage at the Emmys that season 2 is coming “this year, they’re waiting for us to finish the show, it’s coming out this year.”  When Mrs. Maisel dropped last November it was in the heat of the #MeToo movement. The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times.  “You never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won’t work,” said Sherman-Palladino, “You gotta love the show, love your characters, it was an interesting fluke that Maisel came out when we were taking trolls down. I’m glad it’s a character that still resonates. We can look back at 1959 and see that today women aren’t wearing corsets anymore, but the problems still exist.”  The entire late 50s comedy era “is Oz” for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father’s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington.  Season 2 is “about opening Midge’s world up,” says Palladino. Buzz has been that there’s an episode set in Paris, as well as one in the comedy stomping ground of the era, the Catskills.  “There are dragons,” joked EP Daniel Palladino, making a Game of Thrones reference.",1

"Solange Knowles has been forced to cancel her New Year’s Eve performance at Afropunk Fest in South Africa due to an ongoing health struggle, she revealed Wednesday on Instagram.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The singer, 31, shared the news on social media and wrote that she struggled to find the words to explain the disorder she had been “quietly treating” for the past five months.  “Wrote, deleted and re wrote this like 5 times…” Knowles wrote. “Still not sure what exactly or how much I want to share… However it’s so important to me for the people in South Africa, a place that has tremendous meaning to me and that has given me SO SO MUCH, to know why I won’t be performing at Afro Punk this NYE.”  She continued, “The past five months I have been quietly treating, and working through an autonomic disorder. [It’s] been a journey that hasn’t been easy on me… Sometimes I feel cool, and other times not so cool at all.”  Knowles explained that her diagnosis was “complicated” and that she is “still learning so much myself.”  “But right now, my doctors are not clearing me for such an extended lengthy flight, and doing a rigorous show right after,” she wrote.  While the singer did not share what type of autonomic disorder she was diagnosed with, people afflicted with it usually have trouble regulating their heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and body temperature as the disorder occurs in the nervous system, according to the Mayo Clinic.  RELATED VIDEO: Beyoncé & JAY-Z Take Snapshot in Elevator Years After the Infamous Incident  Knowles — who is mom to a 13-year-old son — also apologized to the fans who were excited to see her perform at Afropunk, promising that she would return to give them a show.  “I can’t put into words how saddened and sorry I am that I am unable to perform for you guys this NYE, there is simply no other place I wanted to be than there with my family to bring in 2018 with you…….but I give you my ABSOLUTE WORD I will come back with AfroPunk and deliver this performance…..as it is so extremely important to me to connect with the people who have so closely inspired me in so many ways,” she added.  Knowles revealed previous festivals had known about her health and kept it “confidential,” thanking them for their support and for keeping the news to themselves.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty  The younger sister of Beyoncé had canceled two shows this year, including one in November at Florida State University’s homecoming show which she said was due to a medical condition.  And while the “Cranes in the Sky” singer may be struggling, she is determined to begin the new year with a focus on herself.  “As a part of the self-care that I’ve tried to encourage this past year, it needs to start with myself, and I’m looking forward to doing a better job of this 2018,” she wrote. “This past year has been one of the most fulfilling of my life… Performing this record and experiencing the energy exchange with you guys has been astounding, and I’m so excited about continuing to do the work I feel so absolutely humbled and appreciative to be doing next year. It gives me life.”",1

"Share  Fans of Netflix’s cult favorite sci-fi drama series Sense8 have long been excited that the show will do something never done before by an original Netflix series: Return from cancellation. And as of Friday, June 8, the two-hour finale is available to stream on Netflix. The special was directed by Sense8 creator Lana Wachowski and promises to give fans a proper conclusion to the series.  The series about eight people connected through cosmic ways was canceled by Netflix weeks after its second season premiered. Wachowski credited “the passionate letters, the petitions, the collective voice that rose up” from the legion of die-hard Sense8 fans with the show’s revival, according to the heartfelt letter she shared on the show’s official Facebook page.”Improbably, unforeseeably, your love has brought Sense8 back to life.” This is quite surprising since the show’s official Facebook page informed fans days after the show’s cancellation that their petitions and messages were heard but not enough to bring the show back to Netflix.  The letter not only revived hope of Sense8‘s return to our lives but also gave the most definitive answer as to why it was canceled in the first place. In the letter, Wachowski stated Netflix did “love the show as much as we do, but the numbers have always been challenging.” She did not clarify if the numbers she was referring to were low viewership data, the expensive production cost, or both. Either way, that point is now moot in the face of the show’s return and opportunity for closure.  Despite the finality of its brief return, there’s still a sliver of hope that Sense 8 could continue on even further. At the time of its revival from cancellation, Wachowski would not rule out even more Sense8 in the future, writing, “After that … if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know.”  The new two-hour special is the second of its kind in the series. Two days before Christmas in 2016, Netflix released a two-hour holiday special called Happy F*cking New Year.  Sense8 was part of Netflix’s cancellation spree that saw fan-favorites The Get Down, Marco Polo, and the star-studded drama Bloodline canceled within eight months of each other. Unfortunately for fans of those other series, they have not enjoyed the swift resurrection that Sense 8 received.  Update on June 8: The series finale is available on Netflix.",1
"Alexis Bledel Lends Hope to Third 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' Movie  “We just pitched a third movie and I hope it comes together,” the 'Handmaid's Tale' star shared. Meanwhile, co-star Blake Lively added during a separate appearance: ""'Deadpool' is all thanks to the fans. So I'm saying we'll do it.""  Jimmy Fallon has made it clear in the past that he’s a big fan of Gilmore Girls. But on Thursday’s Tonight Show, he revealed to Alexis Bledel that he is also a fan of one of her other projects.  ""[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants] is my jam,” Fallon said. “I love you. I love that movie. I love everyone in it.”  Bledel agreed that she loves it, too. When asked if there will be a third film in the franchise — one believed to have long been in the works — she said, “I really hope so. I would love it. It would be the best thing.”  The actress, who is currently starring on Hulu's second season of The Handmaid’s Tale, then surprised Fallon. “We just pitched a third movie and I hope it comes together,” she revealed. After the audience enthusiastically cheered, Fallon told Bledel that she has to get the movie made. She responded, “I would love it.”  At nearly the same time, her co-star Blake Lively was also answering questions about a potential third film. ""I think that people who love the movie want to see it. Fans have gotten bigger movies made. Deadpool is all thanks to the fans. So I'm saying we'll do it,"" she told Entertainment Tonight while at CinemaCon, referencing husband Ryan Reynolds' movie franchise.  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was released in 2005 and was followed by a sequel in 2008. Along with Bledel and Lively, the films also co-star America Ferrera and Amber Tamblyn. The four play childhood best friends that spend the summers apart, but who keep in touch by exchanging a pair of jeans that magically fit all four of them.  The actresses are also known to be longtime friends off-camera. “We don’t get to see each other a lot because everybody’s work and family and everything, but when everybody’s in town, we do,” Bledel told Fallon when asked about their relationships.  Earlier this year, Tamblyn shared a photo on Instagram of the foursome reuniting that came with a nod to the Time's Up movement.

"About The Duchess of Cambridge The Duchess of Cambridge, born Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, married Prince William at Westminster Abbey in April 2011. Their Royal Highnesses have three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The family's official residence is Kensington Palace. As well as undertaking royal duties in support of The Queen, both in the UK and overseas, The Duchess devotes her time to supporting a number of charities and organisations. Children's mental health The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed champion of issues related to children’s mental health and emotional wellbeing. Her Royal Highness has worked to bring wider public attention to the fact that issues facing children today such as addiction, poverty, abuse, neglect, loss and illness of family members, can have a long-lasting and traumatic impact if left unsupported. In particular she has highlighted the need for open and honest conversations about the subject to try and combat stigma, and also the importance of early intervention mental health support for young people, to tackle these issues at the earliest possible stage, so that children have the brightest possible futures, as they deserve. It is our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emotional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future The Duchess of Cambridge Heads Together In 2017 The Duchess spearheaded the Heads Together mental health campaign with The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, leading a coalition of eight mental health charity partners to change the national conversation on mental health. The campaign aimed to build on existing progress nationwide in tackling stigma, raising awareness, and providing vital help for people with mental health problems. The team of charities covered a wide range of mental health issues that are close to The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry's passions. They were: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families; Best Beginnings; CALM – The Campaign Against Living Miserably; Contact (a military mental health coalition); Mind; Place2Be; The Mix; YoungMinds. Heads Together was privileged to be the 2017 Virgin Money London Marathon Charity of the Year giving the campaign a positive platform to raise funds for the charity partners and to start millions of conversations about mental wellbeing. Addiction Through her work with Action on Addiction, The Duchess of Cambridge was struck by the fact that children of addicts are twice as likely to go on to become addicts themselves. In 2013, The Duchess of Cambridge launched M-PACT Plus, an initiative to support children, parents and families affected by parental drug and alcohol misuse, with the aim of providing early specialist support to children to prevent these inevitable outcomes. The project involves training school staff to identify children affected by a parent's drug or alcohol misuse. It then brings families together to work with trained practitioners. The project was convened at Her Royal Highness's request by her own charity The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Children's palliative care The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed supporter of children’s hospices and wider palliative care, which provides a vital lifeline to children and families affected by life-limiting conditions. Through her Royal engagements, charitable patronages and in speeches, she has worked to bring wider public attention to the hospice movement, and the holistic services they offer to families. The Duchess of Cambridge has been publicly involved in this area since she became Royal Patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH) in January 2012. She has supported their major fundraising efforts to build a new children's hospice The Nook, in Norfolk. Royal patronages The Duchess is Patron of 13 organisations, where she feels her support can make a difference. These broadly reflect her interests in supporting the most vulnerable families and young people, promoting opportunities though sport, and showcasing national institutions. As their Royal Patron, The Duchess will back their key projects and initiatives, spotlight their work through her programme of official engagements and where appropriate by convening organisations to work in support of each other. The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry In addition to supporting charities and organisations, The Duchess of Cambridge, like her husband and Prince Harry, is able to direct her own philanthropic work through The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Royal Foundation develops programmes and charitable projects based on the interests of Their Royal Highnesses by working with organisations which are already making a proven impact in their respective fields. The Royal Foundation provides additional investment, mentoring, support and partnerships for these programmes, and lends its own profile and leverage to enhance the effect of their good work.  Biography The Duchess of Cambridge became a member of the Royal Family in 2011, upon her marriage to Prince William. Since that time, she has taken on Royal duties in support of The Queen through engagements at home and overseas, alongside a portfolio of charitable work and patronages. The Duchess's charitable work is driven by a personal desire to help make a difference in some key areas, where she feels her support can help. In recent years, The Duchess has drawn attention to the importance of supporting the mental health and emotional wellbeing of children, the impact of addiction on children and families, and the necessary measures to support children suffering from family breakdown. Early life Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born to Michael and Carole Middleton at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 9 January 1982. The Duchess is the eldest of three children. The Duchess of Cambridge was christened at the parish church of St. Andrew’s Bradfield in Berkshire on 20 June 1982.

Their official residence is at Kensington Palace.  Supporting The Queen The Duchess of Cambridge works in support of The Queen in carrying out Royal duties both at home and overseas. She has been hugely inspired by the leadership The Queen has provided for over 60 years and will continue to play her part in supporting and celebrating The Queen in the UK and around the Commonwealth wherever possible. The Duchess of Cambridge supports The Queen and the Royal Family in a number of ways. Her Royal Highness regularly undertakes Royal engagements in towns and cities across the United Kingdom, joining The Queen and other members of the Royal Family on occasions. She also plays a full role at annual Royal events. These include: • Garden Parties at Buckingham Palace  • Celebrating The Queen's official birthday at Trooping the Colour  • Joining members of the Royal Family in welcoming Heads of State on State Visits to the UK  • The Remembrance Day ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London Remembrance The Duchess of Cambridge joined her husband and members of the Royal Family to lead moments of national commemoration for the two World Wars in Europe. Together The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Arromanches in June 2014 where they met veterans and their families. They also led the August 2014 services commemorating the centenary of the First World War in Liege, joining Prince Harry at a service in Saint Symphorien cemetery near Mons, Belgium. In 2016, The Duchess of Cambridge joined other members of the Royal Family at events in France to mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. In July 2017, The Duchess joined The Duke of Cambridge and The King and Queen of the Belgians at the commemorations to mark the centenary of Passchendaele – The Third Battle of Ypres, in Belgium. Royal tours The Duchess of Cambridge has carried out a number of overseas visits with her husband including to Realm and Commonwealth nations on behalf of The Queen, or to undertake an official tour to represent Britain at the request of the Government. The Duchess's first official overseas tour was to Canada in July 2011. For their second tour, in 2012 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Malaysia, Singapore, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu as part of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee year celebrations. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with Prince George, then visited New Zealand and Australia in Spring 2014, followed by New York in December 2014. The Duke and Duchess visited India, Bhutan and Canada in 2016 and Paris, Poland and Germany in 2017. The Duchess made solo visits to the Netherlands in October 2016 and, at the request of Her Majesty's Government, to Luxembourg in May 2017 to participate in the official commemoration of the 1867 Treaty of London. During the visit, Her Royal Highness also attended a series of engagements to celebrate the cultural and historic ties between the UK and Luxembourg. National sporting events The Duchess of Cambridge, herself a keen sportswoman, also represents the Royal Family at major national sporting events to reflect the nation's support, in particular when Great Britain is acting as the host nation of a major event. Along with Prince Harry, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were Official Ambassadors for Team GB and Paralympic GB in the lead up to, and during, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Again at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, Their Royal Highnesses joined the thousands of fans watching the sports at the venues and also meeting the athletes. They joined forces again in 2014 to witness the spectacular Tour de France Grand Depart in Yorkshire, where they signalled the start of the race, and in 2015 supported Prince Harry in his role as President of the Rugby World Cup. The Duchess is an enthusiastic tennis fan and has regularly attended the Wimbledon Championships, including the men's final in 2014 and 2016, and the semi-final in 2015. At the end of The Queen's 90th birthday year, in 2016, Her Majesty stepped down as Patron from a number of national organisations – at this time The Duchess of Cambridge became Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) Wimbledon and the Lawn Tennis Association. The Duchess's first visit to The Championships as Patron of the AELTC was in July 2017.",0

"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .)  Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life.""  Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!""  The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.""  While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps.""  Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that.""  Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed.  As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!""  During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter!  In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. ""I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!"" she laughed. ""I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!""  One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne.""  Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. ""She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!"" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? ""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother.  Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that. To be able to perform with the love of my life and in front of my brother for life and the beautiful Bindi was just cool.""  So what's next for Mark and BC? Their hit single, "" Roses and Violets ,"" has been climbing the charts, and the couple is recording an EP right now and hoping to get it out on tour. ""It's all Alexander Jean right now!""  Until, of course, season 22 comes along.",0
"Camille Grammer is getting a big pay day.  According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star was awarded 50 percent of her ex-husband Kelsey Grammer’s 401K account from the time of their marriage in 1997 to their separation in 2010.  A judge signed off on the order in October. The reality star filed for divorce from the Frasier actor in July 2010. Their divorce was finalized in February 2011, and the 62-year-old actor married Kayte Walsh two weeks later.  Camille and Kelsey share two children together: daughter Mason Olivia, 16, and son Jude Gordon, 13. The actor has five other children from previous relationships.  Party night with my love.

"Angelina Jolie wants to get “revenge” on Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, according to a completely wrong report. The story alleges Jolie is facing her “worst fear” now that Pitt and Aniston have supposedly reunited, and claims she’s striking back. But Gossip Cop can debunk the contentions.  According to Woman’s Day, Jolie has been a “constant fixture on the red carpet” recently and is “pulling out all the stops to look simply stunning at every occasion,” but her “flawless show-off is purely for Brad and Jennifer’s benefit.” The narrative suggests Jolie wants her estranged husband and his ex-wife to see how well she’s doing, even though she’s privately upset. “Ange is one green-eyed woman right now and can’t stand the thought of Brad spending time with Jen,” a so-called “source” is quoted as saying.  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  “She’s seething even thinking about it,” the tabloid’s supposed snitch continues, alleging Jolie was “always petrified” Aniston would “rear her head again.” In fact, the purported tipster claims Jolie would “squirm and spit venom” if she ever saw a “glimpse” of Aniston’s name during her marriage to Pitt. The gossip magazine even contends “Jennifer’s name was banned from the Jolie-Pitt household,” and asserts that with a “romantic reunion [in] the cards between Brad and Jennifer,” Jolie’s “biggest fears could be realized.”  The outlet’s aforementioned “source” alleges, “The very thought of Jen playing ‘stepmom’ to [her] kids… makes her toes curl. She says it’s her worst nightmare, which she can’t and won’t let happen.” And so the publication claims Jolie plans on getting her “revenge” by proving Pitt “got back with Jennifer before they had officially broken up in 2016.” Explains the questionable insider, “Ange is convinced that proving they were talking before the split and uncovering their romance will give her more ammunition” in her divorce battle with the actor.  “She hopes it will help her get full custody of the kids by exposing Brad’s ‘irresponsible’ behavior,” contends the “source,” prompting the tabloid to editorialize, “Sounds like the war is about to get even messier.” But while Jolie and Pitt do still need to work out their divorce settlement, there is no “war” involving Aniston. In fact, Pitt and Aniston haven’t even seen each other in ages.  The suggestion that they were carrying on an affair in 2016 behind Jolie’s back, while Aniston was committed to her own husband Justin Theroux, is out-and-out fiction. Indeed, this entire story relies on false premises. Pitt and Aniston were not secretly engaged in a “romance” during their respective marriages, and there’s no “romantic reunion” on the horizon now. Therefore, Jolie has no reason to get “revenge” on the pair or drag Aniston into her divorce proceedings.  Furthermore, the notion that Jolie is only attending red carpet events to get Pitt and Aniston’s attention is ridiculous and false. In most cases, she has been at awards shows, such as the BAFTAs earlier this month, because her film First They Killed My Father was nominated. Other times, Jolie’s received special honors, like at the recent American Society Of Cinematographers Awards, and in other instances, she’s been invited to participate as a presenter. This all has nothing to do with Pitt and Aniston.  Related slideshow: Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt having secret sleepovers and more tabloid tales debunked",0

"First lady Michelle Obama has made it clear she's eager to leave the White House, step into the next phase of her life, and even enjoy a simple trip to Target.  With less than a week until President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in and moves into the White House President Obama is sitting down with multiple news outlets to discuss his final days and office and legacy, and he revealed to 60 Minutes just how eager his wife is to move on.  SEE ALSO: Malia Obama breaks into tears during her father's farewell speech  ""Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny, she's thrived as a first lady, but it's not her preference,"" the outgoing president explained in his interview with the news program. ""She never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic given how good she is.""  ""She used to say, Barack's exactly the kinda guy I want to be president I just wish he didn't want to do it when I was married to him,"" he added.  60 PHOTOS Barack and Michelle Obama through the years See Gallery Barack and Michelle Obama through the years Candidate for the U.S. Senate Barack Obama (D-IL) (L) holding his daughter Malia with wife Michelle and youngest daughter Sasha (R) celebrate his victory with supporters over Repulican rival Alan Keyes November 2, 2004 in Chicago, Illinois.

"Dior was so close to doing a great thing, but then fumbled at the last minute. For the label's Cruise 2019 collection, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri based her collection on the beautiful clothing worn by Mexican Escaramuza Charra riders. However, Chirui's inspiration fell flat when her clothing appeared on Dior's face, Jennifer Lawrence. Now, both Dior and Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.  Escaramuza is a traditional Mexican sport that is comprised of 10 to 16 women on horseback doing choreographed dancing and stunts to Mexican music. The sport first began at the birth of the Mexican revolution, during which women were allowed to participate and appear at the front of the battle in their traditional dress.  The wardrobe of the Escaramuza is as beautiful and precise as their routines, and an Escaramuza team must adhere to strict guidelines when crafting their uniform. Frills, shawls, ornaments, boots, and hats are all musts, and give fashion labels like Dior a lot to drool over.  However, by putting Jennifer Lawrence — who is neither Mexican nor Latina — in clothing inspired by such culturally important dress for Mexican women has many questioning whether or not Dior cares about the cultural significance of the Escaramuza at all.  Lawrence said in a behind-the-scenes clip from the photoshoot featured on Dior's Instagram, ""One of the main inspirations of this collection is the traditional women riders of Mexico. I'm really excited that this collection is looking at and celebrating these women's heritage through such a modern lens.""  Many fault Dior for lacking the wherewithal to cast a Mexican model as the face of the collection. Although Lawrence should have seen through the culturally appropriative problem, it's more disappointing that Dior is just that oblivious.  how many marketing meetings did the @Dior team go through before deciding Jennifer Lawrence was the best face for a “modern Mexican” inspired line — hibernal worm (@indigogurt) November 14, 2018  Well this is super fucked up! This collection was inspired by 'women riders in Mexico' but is faced by Jennifer Lawrence and the shoot took place in California.....for real @Dior ????? https://t.co/7U5WMHHEk2 — Margot Woll (@margotwoll) November 13, 2018  ""The audacity to call this shit modern because it’s worn by a white woman is ignorant""https://t.co/iyixYUSxLJ — HotNewHipHop (@HotNewHipHop) November 14, 2018  Dior did feature a team of Escaramuza, wearing uniforms from Chirui's collection, in the the label's Cruise 2019 fashion show. However, the models presenting the inspired clothing on the runway were primarily white. It's a bit boggling how Dior completely missed the mark.  This cultural appropriation slip up is an obvious reminder that the fashion industry still has a long road ahead of them in terms of diversification and inclusion. Labels must become more aware of the impact they have on culture and society, and do more to make formative statements with their collections.",1
"Mariah Carey is not having a ""midlife crisis"", despite a manufactured tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We're told it's ""not true"".    The allegation comes from OK!, which claims the singer was ""partying with a crowd"" that was ""half her age"" at Catch restaurant in Los Angeles last month. A so-called ""source"" tells the outlet, ""She clearly thought she was the hippest, coolest person there, when in reality everyone was rolling their eyes."" Carey is ""regressing"", further purports the magazine's supposed insider, adding that she has recruited a group of ""young girlfriends"" and is picking up ""boy toys"" in an attempt to ""fill a void"".    But Gossip Cop investigated, and a rep for the singer exclusively assures us the entire report is ""not true"". Carey, despite having recently separated from Bryan Tanaka, is not going through a ""midlife crisis"", and any claims made otherwise are simply false. What's more, we're further told the star is currently at the ""top of her game"". From the number of inaccurate stories that OK! is pumping out, it's clear that the tabloid is in a state of crisis, not Carey.    Unfortunately, we're not remotely surprised by the outlet's latest piece of fiction. In March, Gossip Cop corrected the magazine for falsely alleging Carey and Nick Cannon argued at Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards. And shortly before that bogus tale, we debunked the publication for wrongly claiming Carey and Lionel Richie were feuding over their joint tour. There was no truth to those stories, and the same goes for this one.    (Gossip Cop)",0

"Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.  Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party  Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable?  photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty  May 2011: Billboard Music Awards  Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.  photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty  November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently  Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.  photography via instagram.com/ashilrd  January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber  They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it.  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards  The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split.  photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin    December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours  Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).  photography via instagram.com/zedd  January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin  Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.  photography via instagram.com/selenamylight  September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE  Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.  photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator  November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”.  photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin  January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve  Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — rip jelena 2010-2018 (@thorsodn) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber 💕 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  📱| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 3, 2016 at 4:12pm PST  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Now I know what Love is A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 16, 2018 at 7:45pm PST  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — Hennessy ✨ (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best.",0

Boettcher explained: 'We spent a great deal of time with her [on this project] and she never said a bad word about anyone. Through her career, every cast and crew member loved working with her. She'd remember every one of their names, their kids, and most importantly, the names of their pets!'

"Jennifer Aniston.  Jennifer Aniston has been extremely fine and okay and great for some time now — she’s married to the artfully manscaped Justin Theroux, she’s working on a show with Reese Witherspoon, and her ex-husband Brad Pitt is in the process of divorcing Angelina Jolie, the woman he started seeing while he and Aniston were still married, a sad fact that must send a shiver of schadenfreude up Jen’s spine now and again. But Aniston doesn’t want to keep all this fine and okay and great energy to herself, she wants to share it with others who may tragically be less fine. How? As she told Amy Sedaris in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar:  My dream is to open a wellness center. I have a fantasy where you have this beautiful space with facialists, rotating workouts, meditation classes, and a café with recipes that are healthier versions of delicious foods so you’re not deprived. I’m working on it in my brain. Not to sound all woo-woo, but if you go out into the world with inner peace, you’re more joyful. There’s a life’s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.  All of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:  I had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne. It was an intense thing to look at Justin’s face. He was like, “What is happening?”  Alarming. But that probably wouldn’t happen at Jen’s wellness center of course, because she’s fine, it’s fine, everything’s extremely fine.",0
"It's hard to believe that The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement came out way back in August 2004. While the past thirteen years have just flown by, fans of the Disney series have never given up hope on getting another sequel. And if new reports are to be believed, The Princess Diaries 3 is finally on the way, but will Anne Hathaway and Chris Pine return? Here's what we know so far.  There's Already a Script!  Author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot told Entertainment Weekly that a script exists. She also said that if the movie gets made, it'll happen ""kind of as a tribute"" to Garry Marshall, director of the first two movies, who sadly passed away in 2016. But Cabot refused to reveal any further details, apart from saying that the movies would likely deviate from the book series. She said, ""I think of them as two different universes.""  Garry Marshall Was Planning the Third Instalment Before He Died  In an interview with People in March 2016, Marshall said, ""I was with Anne Hathaway a couple weeks ago. It looks like we want to do The Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan."" Sadly, Marshall's plan never came to fruition, but it's possible that the sequel will still be set in New York, to honor his idea.  Anne Hathaway Has an Idea for the Sequel  Julie Andrews, who plays Queen Clarisse Renaldi in the movies, told Buzzfeed in February 2017, ""Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I'm all for it, so if she'd like to…"" And, yes, the ""Annie"" she's referring to is Anne Hathaway. Andrews also confirmed, ""I would very willingly and happily do it.""  However, It Might Be Some Time Before 'The Princess Diaries 3' Comes Out  Hathaway's rep reportedly told Buzzfeed in March 2017, ""it's way too premature to discuss this project.""  Chris Pine Is Open to It  In January 2016, during a fan Q & A for Entertainment Weekly, Pine was asked ""Don't you pray every night for a Princess Diaries 3?"" And of course he replied, ""Have you been reading my diary???""  Mandy Moore Would Consider a Cameo  In July 2017, Moore told ELLE.com, ""If I'm going to be involved, I would be down for a cameo—maybe she could make amends with Mia and apologize for being a bully when she was younger. She was insecure, going through a difficult time in her life and [has now] reflected on why that wasn't okay.""  Princess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz Would Come Back  In July 2016, Heather Matarazzo, who played Princess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz, told Cosmopolitan that she would definitely return for another sequel. She said, ""If Annie and Julie are down, of course.""  The Fans Are Ready  Honestly if they make a third #PrincessDiaries movie my heart would probably explode with joy. — Sara Lilkas 🐍🌻 (@Sarawrr13) July 29, 2017  I want people to stop playing with my heart strings and confirm a 3rd #PrincessDiaries is happening 👑 ❤️ — Katie ☺ (@katiemadden98) July 30, 2017  While we all wait for an official announcement, there's plenty of time to rewatch the first two movies, and remember just how cute Chris Pine was in Royal Engagement.",1
"Mel B’s sister, Danielle Brown has decided to speak against the alleged abuse Stephen Belafonte has put his wife through after Mel got a restraining order against the man. Danielle started and entire social media war against the abuser and slammed him with her sharp words.

"Millie Bobby Brown’s got more skills than Eleven! The 13-year-old Stranger Things actress visited The Tonight Show on Tuesday to promote the Netflix show’s second season.  She decided to recap the beloved series' first season in an epic rap.  “Let’s go back to Indiana circa 1983, just four boys in the basement, chillin’ playing D&D,” she began, effortlessly rapping in her jumpsuit. “There was Lucas, there was Willy Will, and Dustin, there was Mike. But one night Will goes missing while he’s riding on his bike. Yes, that’s when they met me, Eleven. I had no hair on my head. I had been so close to dead.”  She continued, finally referencing her character’s signature traits, rapping, “All I need is my Eggo waffles, I’m in love with those.

But I think it’s cool. I’m grateful for it.”  She also gave host Jimmy Fallon a bit of a spoiler, saying that Mike and Eleven kiss again in the second season. Turns out, the moment wasn’t exactly romantic when Brown was filming with her co-star Finn Wolfhard.  “He was like, ‘I’m coming in,’” she said, miming Wolfhard’s tight-lipped advance. “And he was like a ventriloquist. It was the craziest thing.”  She noted that whenever she hears the ‘80s song that was playing during the moment she gets “goosebumps.” But when the audience “aww’d” over that statement she replied, “No! In disgust.”  Brown also gushed over her favorite TV family – the Kardashians.

'I know we've been keeping this quiet but we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately. To enjoy our first precious moments just us... I am so thankful, excited, nervous, eager, overjoyed and scared all in one! But it's the best bundle of feelings I've ever felt in my life!'  Following Khloe's announcement, fans have been urging Kylie to finally share her own baby news too. They were left disappointed when the youngest Kardashian-Jenner star didn't appear on the final day of the family's Christmas card as anticipated.",0
"Stormi may have a sibling on the way.  Is Kylie Jenner pregnant again with baby #2? Already? Rumors say yes. There's been rampant speculation that the reality star And Forbes' youngest almost-billionaire and her beau Travis Scott are expecting a second child. Even though its only been a few months since Kylie and Travis' first daughter, Stormi, was born it's very possible that she could be pregnant.  We, of course, may not know for awhile as she didn't officially confirm her last pregnancy until three days after she gave birth.  Here is what we know so far about the Kylie pregnancy rumors:  1. A source said they were trying for another baby while on vacation.  A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 11:12am PDT  Kylie and Travis went on vacation to Turks and Caicos to celebrate Travis' birthday. While there, they were reportedly doing more than just celebrating. ""Kylie and Travis have been having amazing baby-making sex while on vacation. Travis is totally turned on by Kylie now that she has bounced back from her pregnancy and has all of her insane curves again. Travis finds Kylie irresistible in her bikini and thinks she looks amazing,"" a source said.  2. Kylie wants Stormi to have a sibling close in age.  A post shared by Kendall + Kylie (@kendallandkylie) on Jul 17, 2018 at 7:17pm PDT  The new mom wants her daughter to have a sibling close in age like her and Kendall. ""Kylie wants her kids to be close in age like she is with Kendall. So they can grow up being best friends."" Kendall is two years older than Kylie so they still have a bit more time.  3. Kylie loves seeing Travis be a dad.  A post shared by Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott (@kyandtravis) on Jul 17, 2018 at 10:45am PDT  A source said, ""Nothing has been sexier to Kylie than to watch Travis become an amazing father to their daughter. Things between them have never been better.""  4. Kylie had a pregnancy scare.  A month ago, Kylie reportedly had a pregnancy scare. A source close to Kylie told Hollywood Life the scare ""really freaked her out,"" but that ""Travis was super excited to have another kid right away. [Kylie] was totally upset over the idea of being pregnant again so quickly. She has been so relieved to get her body back after the last year, so she is not ready to go through it all again so soon after giving birth to Stormi,"" the source explains. ""Kylie thought that it must be some miracle for her to get pregnant again so soon after giving birth, but quickly realized it was only a false alarm.""  5. She's gotten pregnant quickly before.  Just one month into her relationship with Travis Scott the young mogul found out she was expecting. She says this was because their relationship felt so natural and drama-free from the public eye. ""We had a lot of downtime. It was organic. And we would just go to these random cities. We got to not be who we really were. Like, if we were in LA, I feel like it would’ve been way different. Everything happened for a reason. We weren’t going out as ‘Kylie and Trav.’ We would just be in Cleveland, walking the street for hours. We would go on walks, and no one would bother us,"" Kyile said.  6. She said she had the 'perfect' experience with her first pregnancy.  A post shared by Stormi Jenner Webster (@stormijenner.w) on Jul 17, 2018 at 7:57pm PDT  When asked what the worst part of her pregnancy was she had a surprising answer. “There really was no worst part! probably not being able to eat sushi lol,” the makeup mogul revealed. “I had such a perfect experience.” Sounds like she wouldn't mind being pregnant again.  7. Travis and Kylie like to keep things private.  A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 7, 2018 at 9:55pm PDT  Kylie has said, ""For sure, I know he [Travis] doesn't like the attention. That's why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won't come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don't want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don't ever see us together, that's okay with me, because we just do our thing."" So if she is, indeed, pregnant, we probably won't know until she's totally ready to share.

"This year has been a pretty wild one already, but it just got stranger.  Kim Kardashian West — like, beauty mogul and reigning queen of reality TV Kim Kardashian West — visited the White House on Wednesday to talk about prison reform with President Donald Trump.

Kardashian asked the president to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.  Before the meeting, Kardashian tweeted a birthday message for Johnson.  Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you 🙏🏼✨ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018  But people on Twitter just couldn't believe that this was actually happening.  If you would’ve told me five years ago Donald Trump would be POTUS and Kim Kardashian would be in the Oval Office discussing prison reform with him I would have called you insane.    We truly live in the darkest timeline. — Denizcan James (@MrFilmkritik) May 30, 2018  “So, here’s the pitch. It’s a fish out of water story but get this, he’s the president and we have Donald Trump play him. And then, here’s the kicker we have Kim Kardashian play his sassy but still incompetent Chief of staff. It’s like Veep meets The Purge.” pic.twitter.com/3EO9V87vAL — Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) May 30, 2018  I present the 10th circle of Dante's Inferno— Donald Trump meeting with Kim Kardashian about prison reform. pic.twitter.com/rjUseCYQvL — Dani Bostick (@danibostick) May 30, 2018  This book by @richardhine was published in June 2016 https://t.co/ebyLPgViWC — Daniel Radosh (@danielradosh) May 30, 2018  Apparently prison reform hits home for Kushner, who has firsthand experience with an incarcerated family member after his father Charles was charged with tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering. Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.  The young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.  Since the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.  Kardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.  This man is sentenced to 35 yrs for selling drugs. He serves over 21 yrs, is released, finds a job, new relationship, starts a new life, & now is being sent back for another 10 yrs because the original release was an error. This man has completely rehabilitated himself. So sad https://t.co/msLsMSHGxh — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 28, 2018  She also shared a tweet about a man who was sentenced to only 90 days of house arrest after raping a child.  Since he doesn’t have to go on the sex offender registry, let it be known in the court of public opinion instead:    His name is LYLE BURGESS in California and he is the founder of auto part company RARE PARTS INC    Spread the word. Let everyone know what he is, since the law won’t. https://t.co/ar2WPtLJG9 — Kelly (@kellyblaus) May 27, 2018  Kardashian has also hinted at political aspirations. In an unaired clip from Khloe and Lamar, she pondered running for mayor of Glendale, a town in the greater Los Angeles area, because of its prominent Armenian population. (It's worth noting that Glendale doesn't have mayoral elections — instead, its city council appoints a member to serve as mayor for one year.) Despite her past misinformation about the town's bureaucratic structure, it's possible that she used this meeting to sow seeds for future political gain.  Kardashian hasn't made a public statement about the meeting yet, aside from tweeting the birthday message for Alice Marie Johnson. Is there a chance we'll get to see a behind the scenes of the meeting on the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians? Possibly — although season 15 doesn't have a premiere date yet. A Variety report revealed that the Kardashian/Jenner/West empire milked a deal with E! that will keep them on the air until 2020.",0

"Many stars saw great success in 2016, but the year wasn’t without its major celebrity scandals. Here are some of the worst celebrity scandals of the year:  1. Chumlee’s home raided  “Pawn Stars” favorite Austin Lee Russell, better known as Chumlee, was arrested in March after police serving a search warrant in a sexual assault investigation found methamphetamine, marijuana and a gun at his southwest Las Vegas home. The 33-year-old was booked on 19 drug-possession charges and one weapon charge. In May, the reality star took a plea deal and agreed to counseling and three years' probation.  2. Taylor Swift’s image questioned  Hollywood good girl Taylor Swift came under intense scrutiny in 2016 after her messy breakup with Calvin Harris and her reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.  First, Harris slammed Swift for comments her PR team made about a song they’d worked on together. Referencing Swift’s long rumored feud with Katy Perry he wrote on Twitter, “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry...”  Then, Swift slammed Kanye West at the Grammys for his lyrics to “Famous,” in which he rapped about her “I made that bitch famous.” At the Grammys, Swift cautioned her fans about “people… who try to undercut your success or take credit for… your fame."" West insisted he’d had the pop star’s permission to include her in his song, and in July, Kim Kardashian was ready to prove it. She released a recording of Swift speaking with West, approving of her name being used on the track.  The incidents left Swift fans wondering if the starlet was secretly a celebrity mean girl.  Since then, however, she has avoided controversy and done charity work that likely has her back in the good graces of the Twitterverse.    3. Ryan Lochte’s lie  Ryan Lochte had a lot going for him as he headed to Rio for the Olympics over the summer, but the spotlight-hungry swimmer was branded a liar after he claimed he’d been robbed at gunpoint while out in Brazil, and then recanted the story once inconsistencies became apparent. Lochte lost his sponsorships over the incident, and the Olympic Committee banned him from swimming through June 2017. He also lost $100,000 in bonuses.  Still, the swimmer landed a short-lived slot on “Dancing with the Stars” and got engaged to his Playboy model girlfriend, so all in all he didn’t have the worst 2016 ever.  4. Accusations against Johnny Depp  In May, Johnny Depp made headlines for all the wrong reasons when his ex Amber Heard accused him of abusing her. In the weeks that followed, a video leaked of a violent clash between Heard and Depp and fans quickly turned on the actor. His camp denied the abuse allegations and several of his famous exes came forward to defend his character. In August, Depp and Heard quietly settled their divorce. He has since landed a role in J.K. Rowling’s upcoming sequel to “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”  5. Brad Pitt abuse allegations  Brangelina fans were shocked when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced they were going their separate ways in 2016. The pair announced they were calling it quits in September, and things turned even more dramatic when rumors swirled that Pitt was being accused of abusing their oldest son Maddox. In November, the FBI wrapped their investigation into an alleged argument between Pitt and Maddox that took place on a plane, and the agency announced no charges would be filed against Pitt.  6. Kimye turmoil  Both Kim Kardashian and Kanye West faced serious struggles in 2016. Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in October in Paris and thieves made off with millions of dollars in jewelry. The Instagram addict removed herself from the public eye after the traumatic experience. She stopped sharing things on social media and avoided public appearances, opting to stay home with her family.  Then, at the end of November, her husband Kanye West’s trademark erratic behavior took a serious turn when he was hospitalized for a reported psychotic breakdown. The rapper had been ranting more than ever during his concerts – something he is known for – and abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour. He was then suddenly hospitalized and Kim rushed to be by his side. 2016 wasn’t the best year for the Hollywood hot couple to say the least.  7. Gigi mocks Melania  In November, model Gigi Hadid faced backlash after she mocked Melania Trump during her speech at the American Music Awards. ""I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children Sasha and Malia,"" Hadid said through pouted lips and a fake accent, mocking Melania's RNC speech that lifted material from a speech given by Michelle Obama.  The 21-year-old sort of apologized and said that her impression was ""done in good humor.""",0
"It’s not every day that, while taking a photo of two celebrities, another sneaks their way into it.

"Princess Eugenie kept her bridal look under wraps in the weeks leading up to her royal wedding to fiancé Jack Brooksbank. But the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson‘s dress was finally revealed on Friday as she walked down the aisle of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing a custom Peter Pilotto gown.  So how does her Peter Pilotto dress compare to her cousins’ Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle‘s gowns?  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Getty; AP (2)  Press Association via AP Images  The 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.  YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images  The dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.  Press Association via AP Images  “I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it’s really special to stand up for that,” she told the U.K.’s This Morning.  Pilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  The fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack’s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple’s home.  The only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. “[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,” she told British Vogue. “As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I’d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I’ve been pretty on top of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie’s Wedding  Unlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.  For Kate’s 2011 wedding to Prince William, she stuck with a British-based designer too, wearing a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen lace long-sleeve, V-neck gown.  Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images  But it was Meghan’s long-sleeved, unembellished gown that switched-up the British designer trend. U.K. designer Clare Waight Keller designed her custom creation, but for the brand, Givenchy, which is a French fashion house.  Meghan Markle  Can’t get enough of PEOPLE’s Royals coverage?

Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, lent to her by the Queen. The tiara is made of brilliant and rose cut diamonds pavé set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side and was bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth in 1942.  Both Kate and Meghan also wore tiaras straight from the Queen’s jewelry vault. Kate wore the Cartier Halo tiara and Meghan wore the Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau.",1

"Carrie Frances Fisher (October 21, 1956 – December 27, 2016) was an American actress, writer, and comedian.[3] Fisher is known for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars films, a role for which she was nominated for four Saturn Awards. Her other film credits include Shampoo (1975), The Blues Brothers (1980), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), The 'Burbs (1989), When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Soapdish (1991), and The Women (2008).[4] She was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performances on the television series 30 Rock and Catastrophe. She was posthumously made a Disney Legend in 2017,[5] and in 2018 she was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.  Fisher wrote several semi-autobiographical novels, including Postcards from the Edge and an autobiographical one-woman play, and its non-fiction book, Wishful Drinking, based on the play. She wrote the screenplay for the film version of Postcards From The Edge which garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and her one-woman stage show of Wishful Drinking was filmed for television and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special. She worked on other writers' screenplays as a script doctor, including tightening the scripts for Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), and many of the films from the Star Wars franchise, among others.[6] In later years, she earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction.[7]  Fisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. She and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Fisher died of a sudden cardiac arrest on December 27, 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. One of her final films, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, was released on December 15, 2017 and is dedicated to her.[8][9] Fisher will, however, appear in Star Wars: Episode IX through the use of unreleased footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.[10]  Early life [ edit ]  Carrie Frances Fisher[11] was born on October 21, 1956, in Burbank, California,[12] to actors and singers Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.[13][14][15] Fisher's paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants,[16][17][18][19][20] while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of Scots-Irish and English descent.[21][22][23][24]  Fisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959. Her father's third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher's two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores. Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973, when Fisher was 17 years old.[25]  Fisher ""hid in books"" as a child, becoming known in her family as ""the bookworm"".[26] She spent her earliest years reading classic literature, and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 15, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival Irene (1973), starring her mother.[27] Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in Fisher's dropping out of high school.[28] In 1973, Fisher enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months.[26][29] Following her time there, Fisher applied to and was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.[30][31][32]  Career [ edit ]  1970s [ edit ]  She was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved. In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess—feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think. —director George Lucas[33]  Fisher made her film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden play the role of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn also star in the film.[4] In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.[34] At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.[35]  In April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr's 1978 TV special Ringo.[36] The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in Ringo) in the ABC-TV film Leave Yesterday Behind.[37] At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series Laurence Olivier Presents in a television version of the William Inge play Come Back, Little Sheba.[38] That November, she played Princess Leia in the 1978 TV production Star Wars Holiday Special, and sang in the last scene.[39]  1980s [ edit ]  Fisher appeared in the film The Blues Brothers as Jake's vengeful ex-lover; she is listed in the credits as ""Mystery Woman"".[40] While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she choked on a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver and ""saved my life"".[41] She appeared on Broadway in Censored Scenes from King Kong in 1980. The same year, she reprised her role as Princess Leia in The Empire Strikes Back, and appeared with her Star Wars co-stars on the cover of the July 12, 1980 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[42] She also starred as Sister Agnes in the Broadway production of Agnes of God in 1982.[43]  F.I.S.T., in 1978 Fisher with Wim Wenders at a private party after the premiere of the movie, in 1978  In 1983, Fisher returned to the role of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi, and posed in the character's metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[44][45] The costume later achieved a following of its own.[46] In 1986 she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters.  In 1987, Fisher published her first novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian. In 1989 Fisher played a major supporting role in When Harry Met Sally..., and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character's wife in The 'Burbs.[4]  1990s [ edit ]  In 1990, Columbia Pictures released a film version of Postcards from the Edge, adapted for the screen by Fisher and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid.[47] Fisher appeared in the fantasy comedy film Drop Dead Fred in 1991, and played a therapist in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997).[4] During the 1990s, Fisher also published the novels Surrender the Pink (1990) and Delusions of Grandma (1993). Fisher wrote an episode of the television sitcom Roseanne entitled ""Arsenic and Old Mom"", in which her mother Debbie Reynolds made a guest appearance. Fisher also did uncredited script work for movies such as Lethal Weapon 3 (where she wrote some of Rene Russo's dialogue), Outbreak (also starring Russo), The Wedding Singer[48] and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.[49]  2000s [ edit ]  In the 2000 film Scream 3, Fisher played a former actress,[50] and in 2001 she played a nun in the Kevin Smith comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. She also co-wrote the TV comedy film These Old Broads (2001), of which she was also co-executive producer. It starred her mother Debbie Reynolds, as well as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins and Shirley MacLaine.[51]  In addition to acting and writing original works, Fisher was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood, working on the screenplays of other writers.[52][53] She did uncredited polishes on movies in a 15-year stretch from 1991 to 2005. She was hired by George Lucas to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and the dialogue for the Star Wars prequel scripts.[52] Her expertise in this area was the reason she was chosen as one of the interviewers for the screenwriting documentary Dreams on Spec in 2007. In an interview in 2004, Fisher said she no longer did much script doctoring.[53]  In 2005, Women in Film & Video – DC recognized Fisher with the Women of Vision Award.[54]  Fisher also voiced Peter Griffin's boss, Angela, on the animated sitcom Family Guy[55] and wrote the introduction for a book of photographs titled Hollywood Moms, which was published in 2001.[56] Fisher published a sequel to Postcards, The Best Awful There Is, in 2004.

In 2009, Fisher returned to the stage with her play at the Seattle Repertory Theatre.[62] Wishful Drinking then opened on Broadway in New York at Studio 54 and played an extended run from October 2009 until January 2010.[63][64] In December 2009, Fisher's audiobook recording of Wishful Drinking earned her a nomination for a 2009 Grammy Award in the Best Spoken Word Album category.[65]  Fisher joined Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne on Saturday evenings in 2007 for The Essentials with informative and entertaining conversation on Hollywood's best films. She guest-starred in the episode titled ""Sex and Another City"" from season 3 of Sex and the City with Sarah Jessica Parker. On October 25, 2007, Fisher guest-starred as Rosemary Howard on the second-season episode of 30 Rock called ""Rosemary's Baby"", for which she received an Emmy Award nomination.[66] On April 28, 2008, she was a guest on Deal or No Deal.[67] In 2008, she also had a cameo as a doctor in the Star Wars-related comedy Fanboys.  2010s [ edit ]  In 2010, HBO aired a feature-length documentary based on a special live performance of Fisher's Wishful Drinking stage production.[68] At the time of her death, Fisher had been preparing a sequel to the one-woman play.[69]  Fisher speaking at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International  Fisher appeared on the seventh season of Entourage in the summer of 2010.[68] She was among the featured performers at the Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne, which aired in August 2012. In her monologue, Fisher poked fun at her own mental illness,[70] and her fellow roasters' reliance on weight and menopause jokes.[71] Fisher joked that she had no idea why she was asked to roast Roseanne, until ""they explained that we were actually good friends, and that apparently we have worked together.""[72] Host Jane Lynch joked that Fisher was there to add perspective to Roseanne's struggles with weight and drugs. Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher's career, saying she was the only celebrity ""whose action figure is worth more than you are.""[73]  She was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Venice Film Festival.[74] She filmed an appearance on the UK comedy panel show QI that was broadcast on December 25, 2014.[75] Fisher starred alongside Sharon Horgan and comedian Rob Delaney in the British comedy series Catastrophe, that was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on January 19, 2015.[76][77] Her last appearance on Catastrophe, which aired in the UK on April 4, 2017, left many viewers in tears[78] and earned her a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.  In a March 2013 interview following the announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in Episode VII of the Star Wars series. Fisher claimed that Leia was ""Elderly. She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.""[79] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.[80]  In a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying ""as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I'd like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny.""[81]  In March 2014, Fisher stated that she was moving to London for six months because that was where Star Wars Episode VII filming would take place.[82] On April 29, 2014, the cast for the new sequel was officially announced, and Fisher, along with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, and Kenny Baker, were all cast in their original roles for the film. Star Wars Episode VII, subtitled The Force Awakens, was released worldwide on December 18, 2015. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.[83]  In Rogue One (2016), which predates the original trilogy, young versions of Leia and the character Grand Moff Tarkin appear through computer animation.[84][85] Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) shortly before her death.[86] Director Rian Johnson has stated that many of Fisher's own ideas made it into the film, and that she supplied a few of Leia's lines.[87] Variety reported following her death that Fisher was slated to appear in Episode IX, and that Lucasfilm, Disney, and others involved with the film will need to find a way to address her death and what will become of her character.[88][89][90] In July 2018, it was announced that Fisher would appear posthumously in Star Wars: Episode IX via unreleased footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.[91][10]  Fisher's memoir, The Princess Diarist, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[92][93] Her audiobook recording of the memoir earned her the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, awarded 13 months after her death.  Fisher and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,[94] a 2016 documentary about their close relationship featuring interviews, photographs and home movies. The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and broadcast on January 7, 2017.[95]  She will be featured in the film Wonderwell with Rita Ora, which was filmed in the summer of 2016 in Italy.[96]  Personal life [ edit ]  Fisher met musician Paul Simon while filming Star Wars, and the pair dated from 1977 until 1983.[97] In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film The Blues Brothers. She said: ""We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.""[98] Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce.[98] During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song ""Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War"". Simon's song ""Hearts and Bones"" is about their romance.[99][100]  She subsequently had a relationship with Creative Artists Agency principal and talent agent Bryan Lourd. They had one child together, Billie Lourd (b. 1992). Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (Been There Done That) that his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is ""Billy"". The couple's relationship ended when Lourd left to be in a homosexual relationship. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but a 2004 profile of the actress and writer revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.[101]  In her 2016 autobiography The Princess Diarist, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of Star Wars in 1976.[102]  Fisher also had a close relationship with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: ""Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient.""[34]  On February 26, 2005, R. Gregory ""Greg"" Stevens, a lobbyist, was found dead in Fisher's California home. The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as ""cocaine and oxycodone use"" but added chronic, and apparently previously undiagnosed, heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word ""overdose,"" but that wording is not in the final report.[103] In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens' ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: ""I was a nut for a year"", she explained, ""and in that year I took drugs again.""[34]  Fisher described herself as an ""enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God"".[104] She was raised Protestant,[105] but often attended Jewish services (her father's faith) with Orthodox friends.[106]  In 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that ""her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.""[7]  Fisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women's advocacy,[107] animal rights,[108] and LGBT causes.[109] She was open about her experiences caring for friends who suffered from AIDS, contributing financially to various AIDS and HIV organizations, including hosting a benefit for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.[110] She also served as an honorary board member for the International Bipolar Foundation,[111] and, in 2014, received the Golden Heart Award for her work with The Midnight Mission.[112]  She was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig weight loss television ads that aired in January 2011.[113]  Bipolar disorder and drug use [ edit ]  During appearances on 20/20 and The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication.[114] She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to ""dial down"" the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder.[115] She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (""the wild ride of a mood"") and Pam (""who stands on the shore and sobs"").[116] ""Drugs made me feel more normal"", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. ""They contained me.""[115] She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult.[117] This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments.[118] At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to ""blow apart the cement"" in her brain.[119] In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment.[120]  In another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. ""Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter"", she noted.[121][122] In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills.[123] She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, ""I've already played Suzanne.""[124]  In her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French Bulldog named Gary, whom she brought to numerous appearances and interviews.[125] Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.[126]  Death [ edit ]  After finishing the European leg of her book tour (her last TV appearance was on an episode of The Graham Norton Show recorded four days before her death), Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016, from London to Los Angeles when she suffered a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed.[127][a] A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing;[130] another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene. Emergency services in Los Angeles were contacted when the flight crew reported a passenger in distress prior to landing. Fisher was taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she was placed on a ventilator.[131][132]  Following four days in intensive care at UCLA Medical Center, Fisher died on December 27, 2016, at 8:55 a.m. (PST); she was 60 years old.[133] Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed her mother's death in a statement to the press.[131] Many of her co-stars and directors from Star Wars and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.[134]  On January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated ""cardiac arrest/deferred"" as the cause of death. More tests were expected.[135] In a June 16, 2017, news release, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors.[1] A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs, and whether they contributed to her death.[136] Her daughter Billie Lourd stated that Fisher ""battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life [and] ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases... I know my Mom, she’d want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.""[137]  The day after Fisher's death, her mother Debbie Reynolds suffered a stroke at the home of son Todd, where the family was planning Fisher's burial arrangements.[138] She was taken to a hospital, where she died later that afternoon.[139][140] According to Todd Fisher, Reynolds had said, ""I want to be with Carrie"" immediately prior to suffering the stroke.[141][142][b] On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. A portion of Fisher's ashes were laid to rest beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.[144] The remainder of her ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.[145]  In her 2008 book, Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote about what she hoped would eventually be her obituary: ""I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra."" Several obituaries and retrospectives featured the quote.[146] In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, ""Carrie Fisher may the force be with you always"".[3] In the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher's character in Star Wars resided.[147][148] Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher's honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas theaters and other sites.[149][150][151] On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother.[152] Fisher and Reynolds were also both featured in the 89th Academy Awards In Memoriam segment.[153] On March 25, 2017, a public memorial for mother and daughter was held at the Hall of Liberty theater in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The event was streamed live on Reynolds' website. On April 14, a special tribute to Fisher was held by Mark Hamill during the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.[154]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Video games [ edit ]  Bibliography [ edit ]  Novels  Non-fiction  Screenplays  Plays  Wishful Drinking , 2006 [186]  , 2006 Wishful Drinking , 2008 [187]  , 2008 A Spy in the House of Me, 2008[188]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ [128] Several news outlets called the episode a ""massive heart attack"".[129] Radio transmissions and emergency calls included the phrases ""cardiac episode"" and ""cardiac arrest""; witnesses believed they had seen Fisher having a heart attack.Several news outlets called the episode a ""massive heart attack"". ^ [143] In an interview with ABC News , Fisher later said that his mother ""didn't die of a broken heart. ...

"It's off--""canceled,"" if you will. After two seasons and 20 episodes, the E! network on Tuesday announced they will not renew The Arrangement, one of its two scripted series, for a third season.  The fictional celebrity drama, which certainly never mined the Church of Scientology and the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for source material, aired what turned out to be its series finale on May 13. That episode, titled ""Suite Revenge,"" was--at least for a short time--regarded as the Season 2 finale. It was seen by 432,000 viewers and drew a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo.  ""Over two seasons, E!'s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,"" wrote an E! spokesperson in a statement to Deadline on Tuesday. ""While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.""  The Arrangement was produced by Universal Cable Productions and starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan.  The series stylized itself as a high-stakes Hollywood love story exploring the bizarre and sinister underbelly of incredible fame. Ratings for its first season in the spring of 2017 were fruitful by cable standards, having drawn an average of 1.3 million viewers overall and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo. Most commendably, the show became the year's second-most watched new scripted cable drama with women ages 18-34.  Despite its strong start, ratings for Season 2 declined by double digits and the show reached its low point in the middle of this year's 10-episode spring run with a stretch of episodes viewed by 400,000 people or less.  ""Sad to say I got the call that #TheArrangement won't be coming back for a 3rd season,"" tweeted creator, executive producer and writer Jonathan Abrahams early Tuesday night. ""There's grieving to be sure but also gratitude for the opportunity and the experience of working with so many wonderful and talented people. Thanks for all your support, twitter peeps. Much [love].""  As of now, The Royals stands alone as E!'s only remaining scripted series; sticking out like a bearskin hat in a mob of reality programming (Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Bellas, Botched) and celebrity docuseries like Citizen Rose, Very Cavallari and Model Squad.  For its part, The Royals also suffered a marked downturn in ratings this year. Its fate is additionally in limbo following the December 2017 ouster of creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations.  While a twin-killing of scripted fare could be in the offing at the network, E! is reportedly in the early stages of developing a scripted pilot from writer Michael Patrick King called Juicy Stories.  On Tuesday night, Arrangement creator Jonathan Abrahams fielded tweets from disappointed fans of the show. In reply to a question about whether depressed ratings in Season 2 ultimately doomed the series, he wrote: ""Yes. Definitely not for the reason that other show got canceled today...""  E! is owned by NBCUniversal.",1
"Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.  Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring ""both triggering and emotionally exhausting"") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ""a dark time in my life."" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with ""the aftermath of the rape.""  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to. That's the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.""  THR has reached out to Westwick for additional comment, as well as to Cohen for a response to Westwick's assertion.",1

"Just remember kid... it's all BS. - Robert Mitchum to Nick Nolte at the Academy Awards    I live out here in Hollywood and have had my share of celebrities and their situational ethics and pretentious beliefs. Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.    Years ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated ""Hero's Journey..."" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.    Thank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.    Ken Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.  His catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or ""leap of faith"" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...  An amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.    Ken Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job ""is to report on the gamut of entertainment news..."", "" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars."" Who better qualified? I ask. You will actually learn something from Ken's book, and it might even contradict what you think about some of the celebrities he interviewed. If you've seen  Thomas Peter ""Tom"" Shadyac's ""I Am"" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.    Key takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, ""whatever gets you through the night,"" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:    ""I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.""",1
"Prince William is going to be an uncle and Duchess Kate, an aunt! This morning, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced the news that they are expecting their first child together.  ""Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019,"" reads a Tweet from Kensington Palace, released before the Duke and Duchess officially kicked off their royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga.

While the newest addition to the Sussex family isn't due until Spring 2019 (given that Meghan has reportedly had her 12 week scan, many royal reporters are more specifically predicting April or May), Prince William and Duchess Kate will actually become an aunt and uncle for the first time the fall as Kate's sister Pippa is expecting her first child with her husband James Matthews.  Pippa was recently seen at Princess Eugenie's wedding , and is thought to be due in the coming weeks.",1

"Hawaii Five-O “was a really important part of my life for seven years, and I’m grateful to CBS and everyone involved with the show for giving me the opportunity,” Daniel Dae Kim said at TCA this morning during a Q&A for ABC’s new The Good Doctor, on which he is EP.  Kim had been asked – again – to discuss his decision to exit the CBS procedural, a topic that has been covered long and often since it happened.  “I’ve known [CBS Entertainment President] Kelly [Kahl] and [CBS SEVP Programming] Thom [Sherman] for a while…I know them, and like them, and am grateful to them for the words they said on their panel the other day.”  “That said, it’s possible to be grateful and respectful, and still maintain a steadfast sense of your self worth,” Kim said, pointedly.  Days earlier at TCA, Kahl and Sherman took multiple questions about the controversial exits of Hawaii Five-0‘s two Asian co-stars, Kim and Grace Park, who sought parity with the show’s leads, Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, and left after not getting equal pay.  “We never like to lose characters audiences love but that happens on long-running series,” Kahl had said that morning. “We made very lucrative offers to those actors,” he added, while declining to name the dollar amount or how it compared to the salaries of series stars O’Loughlin and Caan. Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.  Saying it was time to “close that chapter…and begin this chapter” of his life, Kim said this morning he “could not be more excited to be back on ABC,” where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. “This is the start of something new.”  And yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he’s not on the CBS series and is now “behind the scenes” on ABC’s doc drama.  “Good morning,” Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.  “I’m very proud to be part of this show,” said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.  “It started as a Korean show,” Kim said. “I loved the message of it,” noting also that the doctor drama is a “familiar genre to American audiences.” The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit.  Kim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.  “I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.  “At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’",1

"“Out with the old, in with the true.”  Days after news broke that Bachelor Winter Games couple Lesley Murphy and Dean Unglert had called it quits, Murphy, 30, addressed the news in an emotional Instagram post.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It’s a bit strange to feel the need to post about this, but I don’t think I can honestly resume my normal programming without giving you an explanation — and maybe that’s the wrong word, but I just wanted to thank y’all for the love and respect you’ve shown me over the past few days,” she began.  “I spent 5 years away from Bachelor Nation as I lived abroad and traveled for work. I came back to Winter Games because I’ve seen this franchise work miracles before,” she continued. “Through The Bachelor and my journey around the world, I have made deep connections, true meaningful intimate relationships with many walks of life. I know it’s imperative to find someone who chooses us and acknowledges our many layers, who can be open and vulnerable, and most importantly, who is ready. To meet someone and be met. To be chosen and to choose. To love and to be loved. This is everything.”  “All we need is that same energy reciprocated, and despite how open and loving you attempt to be, people can only meet you as deeply as they’ve met themselves,” she said. “Don’t be afraid to be the one that loved the most and give everything you had, because you’ve got to find people who love like you do and who are ready. Out with the old, in with the TRUE. It was a long winter, and I’m excited for a new season. Let the spring cleaning commence. I’m ready.”  Unglert, 26, also reflected on the split in his own Instagram post.  “Growing up as a kid I had a crude but utopian idea of what love is,” he said. “I always had this idea that no matter what you did, no matter how you act, as long as you’re true to yourself and act in good conscious, your path would lead you to the one person on this planet you’re meant to be with. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned that although everyone DESERVES love, it’s not something we’re entitled to. Love takes work. Love is compromise. Love is earned.”  “I still have a lot of work to do on myself, a lot to prove to myself, before I’m ready for something like that,” he admitted.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit""; for women, ""Day Dress and Hat"".[42]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[43] It was made of ""double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza"" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[44][45] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[44][46] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[47] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[44][48] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[49] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[44]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[44][48][50] Markle's hair was rolled up with ""face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears"",[51] and was done by Serge Normant.[52] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[51][53] The look was described as ""a soft brown eyeshadow"" with minimal makeup on the face.[51] Her nails were painted in a ""neutral pink-y beige"" for the ceremony.[54] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained ""forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle"".[44] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[44][55] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[56] For the customary bridal themes of ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"", Markle had her gown and veil (the ""new""), the Queen's tiara (the ""borrowed""), sprigs of myrtle taken from ""a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet"" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the ""old""), and Diana's favourite flowers, forget-me-nots, in the bouquet (the ""blue"").[57][58] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[59]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[60] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[61][62] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[60] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[63] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[61][64] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[61]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[65][66] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[67] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[68]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[69][70] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[71] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[72][73]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[74][75] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[76][77] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[78]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[79]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[82] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[83] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[84][85]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[86][87] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[88][89] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[90] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[91]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to ""to love and to cherish"" each other.[92] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[92] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[93] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[94] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[92] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[95]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[96] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[97] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang ""Stand By Me"" in what was described as ""an incredible and powerful moment"".[98] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[99] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[100][101]  The bride walked down the aisle to ""Eternal source of light divine"" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[102] Other music during the service included the motet ""If Ye Love Me"" by Thomas Tallis; the song ""Stand by Me"" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and ""The Lord bless you and keep you"" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and ""This Little Light of Mine"" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[103]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[60] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[86] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[104][105] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[105] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[60] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[106][107][108] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[109]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[110] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[111]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[112]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an ""official list"" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[113] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[114] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[114] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was ""a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother"".[60]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a ""direct relationship"" with the couple.[115] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[116] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[115] The invitees outside the chapel were ""people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children"".[117]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly ""deeply upset"" by her omission.[118]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[119][120][121][122][123]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[124]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[125]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[126][127]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.  Coverage [ edit ]  People watching the wedding at the official residence of the UK Ambassador to Italy, in Rome  Peak viewing figures of 18 million were reported in the UK.[128] About 29 million were reported to have watched in the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.[129] The global audience was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.[130]  Coverage of the royal wedding in the UK was shown on BBC One, ITV, Sky News, CNN (International) and E! (Europe) [131] The wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel.[132] Huw Edwards hosted coverage for BBC TV with Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young and BBC Radio 2 DJ Dermot O'Leary. The BBC Radio coverage was co-hosted by Chris Evans and Scarlett Moffatt.[133] Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham hosted coverage for ITV.[134] Kay Burley, Anna Botting and Alastair Bruce, among others, hosted coverage for Sky.[135]  CBC broadcast the wedding in Canada with Adrienne Arsenault and retired broadcaster Peter Mansbridge presented live coverage that was simulcast on CBC Television, CBC Radio One and CBC News Network.[136] TVNZ screened it in New Zealand along with SBS and Nine in Australia.[131][137] The wedding received 4 million views in Australia.[138]  In Fiji, Fiji Television broadcast the event via BBC with coverage starting from 8:30 pm FJT on 19 May and finishing at 12:30 am on 20 May, when it switched back to normal programming.  In the United States coverage aired on CBS, NBC, ABC, E!, PBS, BBC America, TLC, FOX, and HBO.[139] CBS's coverage began at 4 a.m. EDT with CBS Presents ""The Royal Wedding""[140] and Gayle King provided commentary during the broadcast. ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[141] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[142] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled ""The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!"" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[143] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[144]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[145]  Comments in a ""posh"" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[146]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[147] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[148][149][150][151][152] It was described as a ""landmark for African Americans"", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[153][154][155][156] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that ""Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own"".[157][158]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[159]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[160] The location of the honeymoon had been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[161][162][163]  See also [ edit ]",0
"Three women filed a new class action lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein on Friday, including one who alleged that Weinstein raped her after she came to his office to pitch her internet startup.  The woman, Melissa Thompson, accuses Weinstein of luring her to his hotel room for a meeting in 2011 and then forcibly raping her.  “Thompson was fighting back, but could not out-muscle him,” the lawsuit states. “Thompson closed her eyes, traumatized, praying for the assault to end.”  Earlier that day, Thompson said that she went to Weinstein’s Tribeca office to pitch him on a marketing startup called Intercast Networks. According to the suit, she made a video recording of the encounter on her laptop. As she explained the company’s services, she alleges that Weinstein began to caress her legs. He promised to make a deal that afternoon if she would meet him for a drink at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, the suit alleges. Once there, he brought her to his hotel room, where the alleged rape occurred.  The complaint also alleges that Thompson sought help from the law firm of Benjamin Brafman last fall, and turned over her video evidence to the firm not realizing that Brafman was representing Weinstein.  Related Judge Refuses to Dismiss Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Case New York Attorneys Doubt That Weinstein Case Will Be Dismissed  A second woman, actress Caitlin Dulany, also alleged that Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel du Cap in Cannes in 1996. Dulany earlier told a version of her encounter in a first-person account for the Wrap, though she did not mention the alleged assault. In the suit, Dulany alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent and then masturbated.  The third plaintiff, actress Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room in Toronto in 2000, tried to get her to give him a massage and asked to see her breast. She recoiled, and Weinstein became angry.  “You know Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd were exactly where you are at one point,” Gomes quotes him as saying. “Look at them now. Ashley Judd had no problem f—ing me.” (Judd and Paltrow have both alleged that Weinstein made unwanted advances toward them.)  According to Gomes, she tried to get away, saying “I think I should go now, my boyfriend is waiting for me, and he will be worried.”  Gomes alleges that Weinstein forcibly tried to kiss her, before she fled.  The women are represented by Hagens Berman and the Armenta Law Firm, which also filed an earlier class action suit against Weinstein on behalf of six other women. The suit names Miramax, the Walt Disney Co., and Weinstein as defendants, along with individual board members of the Weinstein Co.  Weinstein has consistently denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sexual acts in New York, and faces up to 25 years in prison on those charges.  His representative has yet to respond to the new allegations.

"When “Girls” premiered in April 2012, it was almost all that the TV aficionado community could talk about, and it made a giant splash in pop culture, too. Nearly everyone had a strong take on the show Lena Dunham created. Below is Part 2 of Variety’s TV critics’ reflections on the show’s legacy and impact — and why they’re both happy and sad that the story of Hannah Horvath and her friends is wrapping up. (Part 1, from before the finale aired, is here, and a post-finale talk with executive producers Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham is here.)  Sonia Saraiya: Well, that was pretty perfect. I mean, it wasn’t, but in its insular, domestic sphere, harsh reality, “Latching” is where this whole season was trending, and such a fitting counterpoint to a similarly insular but much more self-aggrandizing premiere episode of “Girls.” I appreciate that instead of being about transformation, for any of the characters, the finale emphasizes resilience — that problems arise, and our predictable anxieties will flare up, but you can get better at bouncing back.  Furthermore — I have never felt fully onboard with Hannah’s pregnancy as a plot point, and I appreciated learning that she wasn’t fully onboard with it, either. That narrative about being a new mother sounds like it may have come from Jenni Konner, who co-wrote and directed this episode, who talks about childrearing in interviews (including in a post-finale Q&A with Variety). Glimpsing a bit of “Girls” famously raw and unflinching lens directed at child-rearing is pretty satisfying.  Related 'Watchmen' Pilot Cast Revealed, Regina King in Lead Role 'Game of Thrones' Star Says Producers Are 'Absolutely Paranoid' About Spoilers  But really, what got me is that Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car” was stitched — thematically and melodically — through the episode. It’s almost not fair, because that song is wrenching enough to do a lot of emotional heavy lifting on its own. But its circularity about running away, growing up, finding home, and being someone must feel especially relevant when you’re a single mom in a house in the woods, just one car trip away from running away. In the premiere of “Girls,” Hannah asks her own parents for money; in the finale, she has to assume the mantle of grown-up, even though she’s scared s–itless, mostly because someone has to do it, and she can’t quit now. But is this what she wanted? Is she happy? Or is her settled contentment at the end, once Grover has finally started breastfeeding, about as good as it gets in this life? “Fast Car” doesn’t have easy answers, and I liked that “Latching” doesn’t either.  Maureen Ryan: Oh “Girls,” you did the most “Girls” thing possible: After loving most of the lyrical and emotionally acute final season, I spent a good chunk of the finale wanting to scream and fending off a migraine. For me, the combative self-absorption of the characters just felt overly familiar and the setting a little too claustrophobic, and for the first two-thirds of the episode, a lot of the post-birth story played out in ways that I found frustrating rather than illuminating. I see where you’re coming from, and the last few minutes were sweet and memorable, but in the main, I found this particular variety of “Girls” episode — argumentative and somewhat predictable — more off-putting than most. So here we are, having one more critical argument about “Girls” — yay?  The thing is, many different TV shows have hauled out the difficulties of parenting a newborn to manufacture drama or conflict, so the topics on display and the treatments of them just felt overly familiar to me. And perhaps Marnie’s oblivious self-absorption was meant to be funny, but we’ve seen that so many times before, and given the stakes — i.e., the life and health of a baby — her condescending selfishness really grated on me throughout much of the final half-hour. This being “Girls,” perhaps her behavior was meant to annoy, but that’s a flavor that can get old fast.  It wasn’t until the great Becky Ann Baker showed up to school everybody that I could actually begin to find a few shreds of enjoyment in the finale. The upside is, all the yelling and crying and immaturity made me more than OK than with the fact that this show — which I have often loved, especially this season — is ending. Good luck, little Grover. (She really named her kid Grover? Hannah. You did not have to do that. Sigh.)  Saraiya: How funny that you are positive about the show, but not about the finale, while I am almost vice-versa. I liked “Latching,” though I admit that I have no idea what to make of the fact that Hannah’s son is a brown baby — and will grow up to be a man of color. With this show’s relationship to racial dynamics, something about this feels strangely superficial. Of course, at this point, “Girls” is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn’t — but isn’t it a bit odd that It’s never discussed or dealt with, it’s just, oh yeah, Hannah’s having a brown baby? The show’s deep-seated discomfort with engaging with race never disappeared, despite six seasons of us talking about it.  In Part 1, you wrote that you always found “Girls” to be sincere. That struck me while watching the finale and pondering this baby, because I was so often frustrated that the show wasn’t sincere with its setups — there was this surreality or fantasy-level to the characters’ lives that made them more ciphers than characters. Even in this final season, which has been one of the most grounded, I read this long piece about how Hannah’s salaried-with-benefits teaching job at a cushy lib arts school upstate is essentially impossible. Maybe what you were saying is that the show always meant well — but even that, I’m not always so sure about. I’m not saying I’m ascribing evil motives to the show either. But like, I think sometimes the show was going for the best joke, or the most interesting denouement, not the one it felt the most strongly about.  In its defense, though, I think “Girls” was as much about Dunham and co. making characters out of the idiosyncrasies and silliness that they themselves were experiencing in the high creative echelons of contemporary hipsterdom. Hannah the writer, Ray the failed artist, Adam the actor, Marnie the “musician,” Shosh the publicist, Jessa from rehab — and on, and on. That person you know who moved upstate to have a kid on her own. That girl who got engaged two weeks after meeting someone and seems very happy. The one whose marriage fell apart and is now having some obscure experience of personal growth in another state. We don’t have tell-all novels, a la Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis, about the New York arty media scene anymore: now we have shows like “Girls” to deliver second- or thirdhand gossip.  This cements one of my long-held feelings about the show, which is that more than being aimed at millennials, it was a show about millennials for millennials’ parents. Not you, Mo, you proud Gen X-er, but those homeowning HBO subscribers who want to ask what their kids are doing but maybe don’t feel so comfortable asking about “crack-cidents” on the phone. I don’t think it’s insignificant that this series has been as much about Becky Ann Baker’s transformation, as Hannah’s mom, as it has been about Hannah herself. (She was just fantastic in the finale.)  Ryan: I think you’re onto something there. I once wrote a long piece about the similarities between Liz Phair and Lena Dunham (who both went to Oberlin, and who both were lionized and torn apart in equal measure for their creative exploits — 20 years apart). We touched on this briefly in Part 1 of our dialogue, this idea of voyeurism: I would bet most HBO subscribers have never lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but they want a window into that world, just like they want to know, on Sunday nights, what’s up in the realm of dragons and Lannisters. You’re so right about this being the Jay McInerney or Tama Janowitz novel of its time. Who has the time to read the hot new novelist’s take on what the cool people are doing in NYC? But we can watch this show and feel at least partially informed about what the Youngs are up to.  I recall that somewhat early in the show’s run, a bunch of stories were published on the topic of how a goodly number of middle-aged male HBO subscribers watched “Girls.” Well, why wouldn’t they? Not only would it make all those tuition-paying dads feel like they knew what was up in their kids’ lives, “Girls” contended with the issues surrounding masculinity and intimacy that a lot of other prestige shows explore, but with a lot fewer murders and brothels.  Hannah grappled with a lot of things — her narcissism, her difficulty in sustaining jobs and relationships, her parents’ breakup, and now, this season, an unexpected pregnancy. But I’ve been thinking a lot about that the fact that a huge throughline of the show has concerned the reality that the men in Hannah’s life were often both more and less than she could handle, and she was never quite sure what to do about that. (As Hannah herself notes, Grover was just the latest in a long list of males with whom she had difficulties, though he was probably also the cutest. And not to sidestep the race thing, but it’s really strange to me that Hannah wouldn’t address the fact that she is parenting a non-white boy. You’d think that would be the exact sort of thing she’d monologue about, and I can definitely see why you felt that aspect of the story felt tacked-on.)  But speaking of men in general, I think a lot of women watching could relate to the issues that Hannah and all the other women contended with when it came to the guys in their lives. Weirdly enough, there were a lot of moments in which the men felt as though they were more dimensionalized than the women — in a show called “Girls.” It was one more conundrum to contend with, I suppose.  That said, I don’t feel all that cheated about who grew most or least, given that, as you say, for most of the characters on the show, they didn’t grow a ton. As was the case with Don Draper, I think they got better at recognizing and accepting their flaws, and seeing past their own pain and self-absorption and at least attempting altruism on a regular basis (the presence of a helpless baby in your life will often force that kind of accelerated growth on a person). Over time, though they were still spectacularly myopic at times, the show undeniably got better at depicting them sometimes stepping past the landmines that they, in the past, would have embraced in a fairly unthinking way.  Saraiya: This is interesting, because I wouldn’t have come to this conclusion. I never felt the show was interrogating its men. Adam is a great character, and has really grown on me, but I don’t think the show has ever really investigated what was behind his pent-up rage and desire to humiliate his sexual partners in the first season — the negging, almost, that characterized his affection for Hannah. I mean, he ended up with Jessa, who two episodes ago admitted she was a sociopath. Ray is a curmudgeon, and the show kind of embraces that; but along the way he’s used Shoshana pretty abominably. Laird is out here still hitting on Hannah. And while Elijah is, again, played very well by Andrew Rannells, I’m not so sure that he’s learned or grown or anything. If “Girls” is anything, it’s the show of barely perceptible character development.  On the other hand, though, it’s probably significant that Hannah has not a girl baby but a boy — Grover, the name for the cutest boy muppet. And throughout the finale, Hannah makes these funny comments like “Men are disgusting!” for no real reason. Maybe for Dunham, “Girls” was partly an effort to redeem men. It seems she may have succeeded.  Ryan: You may be right — along with the show, I may not have investigated the motivations and actions of the male characters as much as I could have. I think that might be partly for a defensible reason — damn, this cast was so good. It was hard not to be forgiving (possibly too forgiving) when the characters were this unpredictable and often hilarious in their oddity and messy, fascinating humanity. Alex Karpovsky, Adam Driver, Andrew Rannells and Peter Scolari were just so fun to watch, no matter how weak or selfish or weird their characters were, and Chris O’Dowd saying “That was my Humie” in his epic final fight with Jessa ranks in my Top 5 “Girls” lines ever. Elijah was often the comic relief, but Rannells could turn on a dime and almost make me cry, even when he was just running lines in a department store.  Would you agree that the members of the cast — particularly the core four women — have become better actors, in some cases shockingly so, since the show began? It’s not that I think anyone was bad back in 2012, but there were moments when I wondered about the range and versatility of some of the performers. The assurance that they have now, and the wide array of emotions that they can lock into, I find, is truly remarkable. Dunham in particular has been able to work in small gestures and very subtle emotional shades this season. She’s really been exceptional. And it didn’t surprise me that Allison Williams was so good in “Get Out” because she’s grown tremendously on “Girls” in the last few years. Am I wrong about that?  Saraiya: Oh, absolutely. Dunham in particular has become a much stronger actress. Her scene with Jemima Kirke in the penultimate episode, “Goodbye Tour,” is striking for just how emotive both are after spending so many seasons playing robotic caricatures. I’m inclined to think that Williams’ performance has stayed the same, but the writers’ sense of irony towards her has heightened (and in “Get Out,” she is entirely manufactured, which of course makes perfect sense). The show has also been characterized by performers that were already great, right from the start: Becky Ann Baker, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet, and Alex Karpovsky (who in some episodes stole the show from Dunham).  Ryan: Agreed. To wrap things up, here’s the greatest compliment I can pay any show, and I think “Girls” certainly merits it: I know I’ll spend time thinking about what all these men and women are up to, even though I won’t get to check in on their lives and loves and aspirations any time soon. How will they get on? Will they find ways to support each other, even as they stumble over the bigger obstacles and frustrations life is likely to throw at them in the next couple of decades? If there is a reunion movie several years from now, I’d eagerly watch that (and of course it’s no sure thing that this great cast, all of whom deserve to go on to bigger and better things, will not too busy to be reassembled). What’s great is that I honestly can’t fully picture the trajectory of each character, though I like to imagine a future in which Ray is the mayor of New York, or at least the crankiest dad in Brooklyn.  These characters frustrated me, they entertained me, they shook up what was possible on television. They made me re-examine my assumptions and they prompted some of the best conversations I’ve ever had about this medium that we love. Hannah Horvath, you forced me to think harder and to dig deeper, and I don’t know if I fully got what “Girls” was going for all the time, but I’m truly grateful for the provocations and the laughs and the unpredictable ride.  I can easily picture Grover reminiscing about his mom 20 years from now, when he’s sitting on the lawn of some well-regarded liberal arts college.  “She’s a lot,” he’ll probably say, “but it was an adventure every day.”",1
"Amy Schumer has parted ways with Sony’s live-action “Barbie” over a scheduling conflict, Variety has learned.  “Sadly, I’m no longer able to commit to Barbie due to scheduling conflicts,” the actress said in a statement to Variety. “The film has so much promise, and Sony and Mattel have been great partners. I’m bummed, but look forward to seeing Barbie on the big screen.”  The big screen adaptation of Mattel’s iconic toy line was expected to start production this summer on June 23, but Schumer’s busy schedule includes a lengthy promotional tour for her new Fox comedy “Snatched,” which opens in May, as well as an upcoming shoot for Rebecca Miller’s “She Came to Me” opposite Steve Carell.  Sony needed to stick to its June 29, 2018 release date since Mattel already has merchandise and product cycles in motion–shifting the production to accommodate Schumer would have put on a strain on other partners on the film, according to insiders.  “We respect and support Amy’s decision,” a spokesperson for Sony said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing Barbie to the world and sharing updates on casting and filmmakers soon.”  Sony is still trying to find a director for the comedy. The “Barbie” movie is said to be in the vein of “Splash”, “Enchanted” and “Big.” In it, the main character gets kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough and lands in a real-world adventure.  Schumer recently did a polish of the script. It’s unknown whether the same tone will be kept with the comedian no longer attached.  Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Amy Pascal are producing the film. Parkes and MacDonald initiated the original deal with Mattel in 2014.  Schumer can be seen next in the action-comedy “Snatched,” which opens on May 12, 2017, and also has “Thank You for Your Service” opening in October. She is repped by UTA, Carrie Byalick at B Company and Maverick Management.",0
"Several stars have hooked their pets up with pads so sweet they would make any human jealous.  Take Paris Hilton, for instance. The hotel heiress has a two-story “doggy mansion” for her playful pups. The house is inspired by Hilton’s Los Angeles home and features heating, air conditioning, crown molding, a chandelier and a balcony. According to Architectural Digest, the interior of the 300 square-foot doghouse was designed by Faye Resnick and includes furniture by Philippe Starck.  “They’re very spoiled,” Hilton said about her dogs during an interview with ITV2.  Considering Hilton once purchased a Pomeranian worth $13,000, we can only imagine how much she spent on her dogs’ digs.",1
"Days after being absent from his annual duty as moderator for The Walking Dead panel at Comic-Con, Chris Hardwick has been given the green light by AMC to return to the air after allegations of sexual assault and emotional abuse by an ex-girlfriend.  “Following a comprehensive assessment by AMC, working with Ivy Kagan Bierman of the firm Loeb & Loeb, who has considerable experience in this area, Chris Hardwick will return to AMC as the host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick,” the cabler said in a statement Wednesday. “We take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning Chris to work is the appropriate step.”  With AMC taking the stage at TCA on July 29, the timing is obviously somewhat directed to clearing the slate for the cabler so its annual Hall H session would not turn into a one-issue discussion.  The plan is for Hardwick to be back on Talking Dead for its August 12 premiere, right after the Season 4 mid-season debut of Fear The Walking Dead.  Frequent Talking Dead participant and Hardwick’s SDCC panel replacement Yvette Nicole Brown will still front the previously set TWD Season 9 preview special August 5 and appear as a guest on Talking Dead the following week. No return date for Season 2 of Talking With Chris Hardwick has been set yet due to scheduling issues, I hear. All episodes are already in the can.  Deadline revealed July 4 that Community actor Brown would be taking over Hardwick’s SDCC duties. A week later, AMC confirmed that Brown, who called Hardwick a “friend” in a Independence Day tweet, would be fronting the Season 9 preview special for the zombie-apocalypse series and the series’ much watched aftershow as an “interim host” — only half of which she is doing now.  Reps for Hardwick did not respond to request for comment on the move by AMC.  After accusations by Hardwick’s ex Chloe Dykstra surfaced on June 15, AMC a day later pulled the Season 2 June 17 premiere of Talking with Chris Hardwick. At the time, the calber also said that The Wall host would not participate in Talking Dead for the immediate future, nor for the TWD or Doctor Who panels at SDCC he had already been set for.  On June 15, Hardwick strongly denied the allegations from Dykstra, which included sexual and emotional abuse.  “These are very serious allegations and not to be taken lightly which is why I’ve taken the day to consider how to respond,” said Hardwick that night. “I was heartbroken to read Chloe’s post. Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.”  The adamant response from the longtime AMC host and Nerdist founder followed the detailed and harrowing first-person account that Dykstra wrote for Medium. The post never called out Hardwick by name, but the post by TV personality and Syfy’s Heroes of Cosplay castmember made it pretty clear whom she was talking about. With the duo having played out so much of their time together in the public and digital spotlight, there were details about the “mildly successful podcaster” who became “a powerhouse CEO of his own company, their age difference and more. The details were indicative of the now married Hardwick, who announced online his break-up with Dykstra in 2014.  Declaring on June 16 that they were assessing the allegations, NBC has not announced whether Hardwick will be back for more of The Wall later this year.",1
"Insiders in Senate Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office tell the Army Times that there might be an open spot “as early as next week” following the bombshell allegations leveled at Pelosi this past week.While the mainstream media continues to ignore Pelosi’s scandals, Breitbart reported on Thursday that “at least five men and one woman have complained about Pelosi making unwanted advances in the past, but it always got swept under the rug.”According to the publication, two sources have confirmed that they were “incentivized” to transfer out of her office — one with a promotion and one with a lump sum cash payment of $15,000.According to insiders, Pelosi “has determined that she has no choice but to step down, though she wholeheartedly denies the allegations.”Three of Pelosi’s accusers, all male, are former interns and pages, while the others worked as a clerical aide and a member of the cleaning staff..Pelosi has been attacking Roy Moore lately for his alleged consensual affair with a young woman, but was simply her covering up her own misdeeds with fake outrage.It’s time for that old bat to retire anyway, but it’s good to see her go sooner rather than later. Now it’s time for a Republican to take her seat.",0

""We're not going to pressure him to create more seasons if he doesn't feel they are there, but he is already starting to think about what a season three could be,"" she said.  13 Reasons Why season 2 cast: Will Hannah be back?  Despite showrunner Yorkey playing around with the idea of making 13 Reasons Why an anthology series at one point – à la True Detective – season two will keep the same cast and the same setting.  Most notably, yes, Katherine Langford will be back as Hannah Baker.  Netflix  ""I think one of the things that is still hanging out there is this question of, is someone responsible for Hannah's death?"" Yorkey said. ""Is the school responsible? Who is responsible, if anyone is?  ""One way we'll explore that question is through the trial and also through all of these kids reflecting on where they are a few months down the road and what other secrets are being uncovered.  ""That's going to take us into the past, into Hannah's story.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And you'll definitely be seeing a lot of Hannah. HuffPost says that season two will ""will feature [her] in more scenes than even Langford expected"".  In a later interview, Langford teased: ""You see a very different Hannah in season two. I would prepare fans not to expect the Hannah from season one for a multitude of reasons.""  We also can't have a second season without Clay Jensen. Actor Dylan Minnette is too, confirming via this pretty cool Instagram snap:  Minnette shed some light into the second season by saying that the never-before-seen flashbacks with Hannah in the new episodes will cover new ground by featuring other characters rather than himself.  Ross Butler (Zach Dempsey) all but confirmed his return back in April 2017, after he revealed that he dropped out of Riverdale to be part of the second season of 13 Reasons Why.  Christian Navarro (Tony Padilla) tweeted that he was back on set, while Kate Walsh (Olivia Baker) gave an interview revealing the part her character will play in the new episodes.  Brandon Flynn (Justin Foley) said he was excited for season two, posting on Instagram: ""Can't wait to get back to work with this beautiful team!"" (Side-note: Flynn will also be seen in True Detective season three on HBO in 2019.)  Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis) and Justin Prentice (Bryce Walker) are back, with Yorkey stating his interest in continuing their stories (more on that later), while Miles Heizer (Alex Standall) suggested his cliffhanger will be addressed – meaning he will return in some form.

Netflix  Devin Druid (Tyler Down), Amy Hargreaves (Lainie Jensen), Ajiona Alexus (Sherri Holland), Tommy Dorfman (Ryan Shaver), and Timothy Granaderos (Montgomery de la Cruz) all shared the season two teaser video on Twitter and/or Instagram following the show's renewal – which implies that they are all interested in coming back as well.  Brian d'Arcy James (Hannah Baker's father Andy) said in an interview that he would love to return.  And could we finally see justice for Jeff? Brandon Larracuente shared in an interview that he would love to play Jeff Atkins again, and suggested that he could feature in flashbacks.  ""Considering the entire first season, Jeff was shown entirely in flashbacks, that could be a possibility,"" he said.  Instagram @selenagomez  Selena Gomez didn't make a cameo in season one, and fans shouldn't expect her to appear in season two, either.

So I can't imagine that she would pop up for a cameo, but who knows? You never know.""  The show held an open casting call in June, looking for ""students, baseball players, track and field athletes, cheerleaders, boxers, parents, teachers, and coffee shop patrons"". Actors of ""all ages, types, and ethnicities"" were encouraged to attend.  In August, a few new characters were announced...  Kelli O'Hara, a Tony award-winning Broadway actress and star of Masters of Sex, will join the cast as Jackie, an ""advocate for victims of bullying"" (via TVLine).  Other cast additions include Bryce Cass, who will play Cyrus, described as ""an edgy, cynical mischief maker"" and his on-screen sister Mackenzie, played by Chelsea Alden (who you might recognise from American Horror Story), who is ""artsy, witty"" and outspoken.

Those cassettes still exist, of course, but rather the episodes will no longer be structured around Hannah's narration.  Instead, there will be a ""different sort of analogue technology that plays a hugely important role in season two"", showrunner Yorkey teased. ""The cassette tapes aren't at the centre of it – those two boxes of tapes are still hanging around and matter to people, but there will be a new piece of technology for 13-year-olds to Google and try to understand what it was.""  Netflix  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Season two will keep the multiple-timeline storytelling, but Hannah is no longer the narrator. Instead, somebody else will be providing the voiceover.  We will see ""other perspectives on Hannah's story"", too. This is particularly interesting, because there were a couple of moments in the first season where certain characters questioned Hannah's ""truth"".  Of note, remember the letter that Hannah gave to Zach? The one which she claimed he had thrown away, thus rejecting her plea for help?  The reality is that Zach actually kept the note. Did Hannah lie, or was she just mistaken? Maybe that will be explained.  Netflix  ""Hannah told her version of events, but there are at least 12 kids who have another version of those events that we actually haven't really heard from yet,"" Yorkey said.  Time-wise, the second season will pick up ""a number of months"" after season one (according to Yorkey), and will in part cover the trial and the Bakers' lawsuit against the school.  Kate Walsh (Hannah's mother Olivia Baker) teased: ""We'll see more and more of the mystery getting revealed, and I think you see Mrs Baker still questing for the answers of what happened to her daughter.""  You should also expect a number of other loose ends to be addressed when the show returns. Most of the characters were in a dark place by the end of last season (star Miles Heizer confirmed that the show will not shy away from ""taboo topics"" it tackled in the first season), but could some of them find happiness?  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  ""[The individual cliffhangers are] all related, so I would very much like to explore where they all go and to see if there is, as I think there will be, some light for these kids,"" Yorkey said.  Jessica is still trying to recover from her rape, while Bryce – who raped Jessica and Hannah – will hopefully be receiving some form of comeuppance, whatever that may be.  Netflix  ""I want to do Jessica's story the deserved justice of following her as she goes back to school, as she tries to begin to recover from what happened to her, because it's something that millions of young women go through,"" Yorkey said.  ""And also [I want to] see somebody punch Bryce in the face.""  The cast seem to be in agreement as well, with stars such as Alisha Boe and Brandon Flynn saying that they hope to see ""justice for Hannah and Jessica"".  Timothy Granaderos similarly wants the people who wronged Hannah to be ""held accountable"".  Other cliffhangers from the season one finale include what happens with school counsellor Kevin Porter (will he be fired?), Alex's suicide attempt, Zach desperately trying to reach Alex only to receive a call from somebody else, and Tyler's stash of guns.  Netflix  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Selena Gomez, pop singer and one of the producers on the show, said that she has been in the writers' room and that there were story moments she learned which left her ""almost freaking out"".  She later said that the new season will be ""really encouraging and empowering"".  Any fears that 13 Reasons Why would have to censor itself in light of the controversy the show drew for season one (over its depiction of suicide) can rest easy: Dylan Minnette and executive producer Tom McCarthy have both said season two will not be censored.  ""I'm sure it's going to be just as important and dark as last season,"" Minnette said.  The actor added that the second season's theme will be ""recovery"", adding: ""It's naturally going to progressively get to a more emotional place, due to the nature of the story we're telling. I'm sure we're all heading in some dark directions again.""  And new cast member Anne Winters said that the new episodes will be less ""black and white"" compared to season one.  ""This season will explore a little of those grey areas... so that when people raise the question of, 'Well, wasn't it her fault that she did this or that?' this season shows a different take on it,"" she shared.  13 Reasons Why season 2 theories: Did Tyler shoot Alex?  With the way the season one finale ended, it's not surprising that people have been coming up with fan theories about season two – many of which are truly clever and imaginative.  Perhaps the most popular one out there is tied to Alex's cliffhanger. In the finale, Alex was fighting for his life after it was revealed that he shot himself.  We never saw this happen on screen, and fans have suggested that Tyler actually shot him instead. The theory points out that Tyler had a stash of guns hidden in his room, and that he ominously took down Alex's photo that he had previously hung up in his studio.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Netflix  However, Miles Heizer (who plays Alex) has appeared to dismiss that theory.  ""That's another subject that's very rarely shown on screen and is probably a lot more common than people think it is: people attempting to take their lives and it not happening. I'm sure that will bring a crazy set of issues. It would be interesting to go into that,"" he said.  That's not all. Alex was seen in an ambulance – but if you ask some fans, they think that scene is actually a flashforward and it's not Alex there at all. Maybe it's Bryce. Maybe it's Justin.  As for Tyler's stash of guns, one common theory is that he is planning a school shooting.  Netflix  Tyler had photos of numerous other students (including Clay) in his studio – people who have wronged and bullied him. Maybe these students are the targets, and maybe he actually took down Alex's picture because he had decided to spare him (the opposite of the 'Tyler shoots Alex' theory).  Lastly, a lot of fans seem to think that Tony is either a ghost or a figment of Clay's imagination.  This one is a little more difficult to swallow (and indeed, Christian Navarro himself has shot that down), mainly because we have seen Tony interacting with plenty of other characters besides Clay, but it's interesting nonetheless...

"Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani weren’t always so sure their romance was built to stand the test of time.  During a preview of the singer’s upcoming Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist interview, Shelton, 42, admitted that both he and Stefani, 48, initially thought their relationship was strictly a “rebound.”  “When I was going through my divorce, I hit rock bottom, just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,” Shelton told Geist. “It’s a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time.”  Continuing, he added, “If Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought, ‘This is a rebound deal.’”  Shelton and Stefani met as coaches on The Voice and started dating in 2015, not long after Shelton’s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani’s divorce from Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani John Shearer/ACMA2018/Getty  RELATED: Gwen Stefani Joins Blake Shelton Onstage as He Jokes About ‘Messin’ Around’ When They First Met  Shelton went on to say that neither of them were sure things would become serious, because they were both “coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives” and were “kind of clinging to each other to get through this.”  “But now here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it’s going to the next level,” he remarked.  The country singer previously hinted at their not-so-serious origins in September 2017, when he was joined by Stefani for an intimate concert at his Ole Red Tishomingo venue in Oklahoma.  While jokingly discussing their relationship, Shelton explained they “started hanging out together and messing around.”  After Stefani — who had brought along her three sons — appeared surprised by his admission, he added, “you know, texting each other.”  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton REX/Shutterstock  The former No Doubt frontwoman also addressed the beginning of their romance on her 2016 album This Is What the Truth Feels Like.

"Explosive US claims reveal that the 42 year old actress is getting serious with the mystery British millionaire she was linked to last year.    ‘There’s a millionaire British philanthropist who she’s been quietly seeing for over a year now,” a friend of Ange’s spilled to Life & Style.    “Gradually, their romance blossomed into real love.”    And they’re wasting no time taking their relationship to the next level, with the publication reporting that Ange is set to say ‘I do’ to husband number four in London later this year.    So it comes as no surprise that the Maleficent star is pushing to finalise her divorce to Brad and moving their six kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine – to the U.K in time for the wedding.      Life & Style  “She’s decided to marry her wealthy beau as soon as the ink is dry on the divorce from Brad.    “In fact, Angie’s so in love that she was the one to propose.”    The British ceremony fits in perfectly with the busy actresses work schedule.    Maleficent 2 is set to start filming in London from April to August, and then Ange will be fulfilling her duties as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics.    And the kids couldn’t be happier to see their mum walk down the aisle again.    While Ange is no stranger to weddings – she was married to Brit actor Jonny Lee Miller from 1995 – 1997, Hollywood bad boy Billy Bob Thornton for two years in the early 2000’s, before tying the know with Brad in 2014 – this time she’s convinced she’s found ‘The One’.    “She’s described her beau to friends as handsome, distinguished, bold, witty and one of the kindest souls she’s ever met,” continues the source.    “It’s the most unexpected relationship of Angelina’s life, but she thinks he’s the one person who was truly meant for her.”",0
"Amid speculation that Hollywood’s best-known troubled actor Lindsay Lohan may have converted to Islam, a report in Britain’s Independent newspaper suggests the word “converted” may be too strong.  Lohan was seen recently carrying a copy of the Muslim holy book the Quran, and has been public about her Arabic lessons — including drawing jibes online last month when she posted an Instagram image that showed Arabic words above the ostensible English translation, “You’re beautiful.” The Arabic actually read “you’re a donkey.” Lohan said the mistranslation was intentional, part of an inside joke with a friend.  But these steps toward Islam, her spokesperson told The Independent, do not constitute “fully converting” to the religion.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up  “To my knowledge she is not considering fully converting to Islam, but I know she has been taking a keen interest in the Arabic culture of late,” the spokesperson explained.  Lohan was also looking ahead to “upcoming projects in the Middle East,” the paper reported.  “She also spent some time in Dubai earlier this year,” the spokesperson continued, “and became interested in their way of life.”  Lohan, born and raised Catholic, has dabbled in a series of religious traditions, for a time embracing the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah and Scientology.  She once said she was a “very spiritual person” on Oprah Winfrey’s show, and had “become more spiritual as time has gone on.”  “I’m really in touch, whether it’s prayer or meditation. There are so many powers greater than me in the world. I’ve been blessed and lucky enough to have been given a gift to share with other people.”",0
"During the band’s Tuesday appearance on CBS’ 'The Late Late Show,' Corden made an amusing attempt to become the band’s new member.  The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden — or so he hopes — as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.  Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag ""#Jamesstreet.""  In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the “Larger Than Life” single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. ""Corden's back, alright,"" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan.  While Kevin Richardson explained to Corden that no one was going to opt out of the performance, the late-night host responded, ""How hard is it? What is being a Backstreet Boy? It's wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it.""  Following Brian Littrell's insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell's place onstage. ""Show me the meaning of being lonely,"" Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room.  Following Littrell's forced departure, Corden tried to learn the choreography for the performance. He also took the liberty of suggesting new dance moves. When asked when he should do the worm, Howie Dorough responded, ""Maybe after the show.""  Despite resistance from the bandmembers, Corden eventually took on the role of choreographer and incorporated a number of new dance moves, including the band lifting him up during ""Larger Than Life."" When they perfected the lift, Corden instructed, ""And then you guys disappear 'til the end of the song.""  Not only did Corden take over for the performance, but he also attended the band's meet and greet. When taking a group photo with a fan, Corden flipped the iPhone camera and instead took a selfie. He then blocked a fan in another photo.  Corden led a prayer circle before he and the Backstreet Boys took the stage. ""Dear Lord, heavenly Jesus. I know what you're thinking. What's Brian doing there? We're thinking the same,"" he said. ""Make us strong. Show us the meaning of being lonely. Quit playing games with out hearts. Give us the call and know that everybody."" After a moment of silence, he added, ""I can't think of any other Backstreet Boys songs. We want it that way. We want it that way!""  The sketch then cut to the performance, in which a photo of Littrell onstage was been replaced with one of Corden. The band then appeared and began to sing ""Larger Than Life"" while the musicians are suspended on platforms in the air. Littrell eventually joined the group onstage. Corden then ran to the front of the stage and showed off his best dance moves, including the running man and the worm, as the band sang behind him.  The performance concluded when Corden thanked fans for coming and told them to drive home safe. Richardson then explained that they had 22 more songs to perform. ""I quit the band,"" Corden responded before walking offstage.  Amid the release of their new single “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” the band is also headlining a Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.

"David and Victoria Beckham may have grown apart a little after nearly two decades of marriage, but they’re not looking to end their relationship any time soon.  “They will always be family,” an insider exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “But David and Victoria are leading very different lives.”  Specifically, adds the insider, Victoria, 43, recently decided she was done living in Los Angeles and wanted to move the family back to the U.K. to work on her eponymous fashion line.  “Victoria just wants an easy life — she doesn’t want stress,” says a source close to the former Spice Girl. David, 42, on the other hand, is enjoying his retirement from soccer and often “does his own thing,” adds the insider. “It’s not unusual for couples to change and grow apart.”  Even when the pair are in their countryside home in Oxfordshire, England, at the same time, they can be worlds apart. The house has been designed with ‘his and hers’ wings,” a source tells Us. “I think they quite like having somewhat separate lives. When you’ve been married that long, some regular distance does you both good!”  The couple, who wed in July 1999, have four children together: sons Brooklyn, 19, Romeo, 15, Cruz, 13, and 6-year-old daughter Harper.  “The kids are the common bond that will keep them united,” the insider says of the pair, who recently celebrated Brooklyn’s birthday together in NYC. They also spent Easter weekend as a family in Miami.  “They are like every married couple I know — some days lovey-dovey, other days cold,” says a second insider. “It comes with being together so long.”  And though they can seem frosty in public, “they’re really fun,” adds the insider. “Victoria is tough at first, but once you break the wall she’s super funny and cool.

"Tab Hunter, the '50s heartthrob who starred in ""Damn Yankees"" and ""Battle Cry,"" came out as gay in his 2005 memoir. (Photo: Simon & Schuster)  Tab Hunter, the All-American movie star who made teen hearts race in the 1950s with his blond good looks and blue eyes, has died at 86, his longtime partner Allan Glaser confirmed to USA TODAY.  Glaser said Hunter collapsed in front of their home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and went into cardiac arrest after a blood clot migrated from his leg to his heart. He added that medical personnel spent six hours trying to revive him, without success.  He would have turned 87 on Wednesday.  In addition to his hit movies, his recording of “Young Love” topped the Billboard pop chart in 1957.  But in his 2005 memoir, “Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star,” Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man.  “I believed, wholeheartedly – still do – that a person’s happiness depends on being true to themselves,” he wrote. “The dilemma, of course, that was being true to myself – and I’m talking sexually now – was impossible in 1953.”  Born Arthur Andrew Kelm, his screen tab (slang for “name” at the time) was fabricated by Henry Willson, the same talent agent who came up with the names Rock Hudson and Rory Calhoun.  The legend goes that Willson said to the young man: “We’ve got to find something to tab you with. Do you have any hobbies?” His client answered, “I ride horses. Hunters.” Agent: “That’s it! We’ll call you Tab Hunter.”  With no dramatic training, Hunter was cast in a minor role in the 1950 drama, “The Lawless.” The fuss over the young actor began two years later when he appeared bare-chested opposite Linda Darnell in the British-made “Island of Desire.” Soon his handsome face and muscular build appeared on magazine covers. Warner Bros., alert to the increasingly important youth market, signed him to a contract.  Hunter made a flurry of movies in the latter half of the 1950s, aimed at capitalizing on his popularity with young girls. The films included such war dramas as “Battle Cry” (with Van Heflin) and “Lafayette Escadrille” (Clint Eastwood in a small role). He made the Westerns “The Burning Hills” (Natalie Wood) and “They Came to Cordura” (Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth). And he made romantic comedies like “The Pleasure of His Company” (Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds.)  A highlight was the 1958 “Damn Yankees!,” an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical with Gwen Verdon and Ray Walston in their Tony-winning New York roles and the original director, George Abbott, sharing direction with Stanley Donen.  Besides the movies, he displayed his athletic skills – he had been a figure skater as well as horseman – in a TV special, “Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates.”  As with so many pop idols, his fans grew up and a new generation sought other favorites. His slide followed the classic pattern: to a television series (“The Tab Hunter Show,” on NBC, 1960-62); European films (“The Golden Arrow”) and cheap kid flicks (“Ride the Wild Surf.”) In his memoir, he took pains to note that “Ride the Wild Surf” was his only beach-party movie; his “Operation Bikini,” despite its title, was “yet another war movie.”  Over the years, he also played small roles in “The Loved One,” “The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean” and “Grease 2.”  In the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, notably John Waters’ 1981 “Polyester” and Paul Bartel’s 1985 “Lust in the Dust,” co-produced by Hunter himself.  Of “Polyester,” Hunter wrote: “Everybody got the joke. … For both John and me, our collaboration paid huge dividends: I’d helped ‘legitimize’ his brand of movie, and he made me ‘hip’ overnight.”  Hunter appeared on Broadway in 1964 in Tennessee Williams’ “The Milk Train Doesn’t Stop Here Anymore” opposite the formidable Tallulah Bankhead. The play closed within days, and he said it was “completely buried under Tallulah’s offhanded trademark campiness.”  Hunter was born in 1931 in New York City, the second son of a mechanic and his German immigrant wife. His father left the family two years later and the boy took his mother’s name, Gelien. Young Arthur Gelien grew up in San Francisco and Long Beach, California, and joined the Coast Guard at 15, lying about his age.  While in New York, he saw Broadway plays and became interested in acting. Back in California, Willson arranged for a two-word role in a small Western, “The Lawless.” He got $500 and a new name.  In his memoir, he said that his career flourished despite some innuendo and smear articles in the scandal sheets – “clear evidence that despite its self-righteous claims, ‘Confidential’ magazine did not influence the taste and opinions of mainstream America.”  Writing the book was difficult, he told The Associated Press in 2005, “because I’m a really private person. I grew up full of denial. I just didn’t like any suggestions or questioning of my sexuality.”  In 1960, Hunter’s boy-next-door reputation did take a hit when he was charged with cruelty for allegedly beating his dog. (He was acquitted). In recent years, Hunter appeared in dinner theaters and organized film projects. After living on a ranch in New Mexico for a time, he took a home in Montecito with his Glaser.  He didn’t dwell on his Hollywood career or regret losing it. “I had my fling, and I was very fortunate,” he remarked. “But that’s all in my past.”  George Takei, another actor-turned-gay activist, honored him on Twitter Monday, writing, ""Tab Hunter was so much more than a teen heartthrob—he was a celebrated actor, trailblazer, and an icon for the LGBTQ community. Brad and I extend our deepest condolences to his husband, Allan Glaser. RIP, Tab. You will be sorely missed.""  Zachary Quinto, who came out in 2011, noted on Instagram how he had gotten to know Hunter over the last year. ""What a life! Such a rich experience. such a vital and generous nature. and such a pioneer of self-acceptance and moving through this world with authenticity as his guide. he will be missed greatly. may he rest in peace.""  Harvey Fierstein, who won Tonys for acting in ""Torch Song Trilogy"" and writing ""La Cage aux Folles"" and ""Kinky Boots,"" called Hunter a ""gawjuss gay icon.""  Sad to report that Tab Hunter, the gawjuss gay icon, and true gentleman, has left the building. We shared some good laughs back in the 80’s. I was always fond of this dear man. — Harvey Fierstein (@HarveyFierstein) July 9, 2018  Contributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u8UsZS",1
"Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at President Donald Trump for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women.  “Of course he said it,” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That”.  Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated.  “President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history,” Bush said.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  “This has hit a raw nerve in me.”  In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.  Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”  After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.  More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.  Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.  “There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,” Bush wrote.  His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.  One woman’s story, about being pushed against a wall and groped, made “the whole ‘better use some Tic Tacs’ and ‘just start kissing them’ routine real,” Bush said. “I believe her”.

"Chris Cornell chose to include a refrain from Led Zeppelin's In My Time of Dying in the last song he ever played live.  The musician, who died from suicide hours after performing with his band Soundgarden in Detroit on Wednesday, looped in the rock band's version of the gospel song to a rendition of Soundgarden hit Rusty Cage.  Lyrics from In My Time of Dying first appeared in songbooks in the 1920s, and it has since been re-interpreted by musicians such as Blind Willie Johnson (in 1927), Bob Dylan (1962) and Led Zeppelin (1975).",1
"Kim Kardashian has returned to Paris for the first time since being robbed at gunpoint of more than $10 million in jewelry in October 2016. Today, the social media star visited the City of Lights for Virgil Abloh's inaugural show for Louis Vuitton. The designer is a close friend and collaborator of Kim's husband, Kanye West. The last time Kim was in Paris was also for fashion week.  TMZ reports that the Wests were ""surrounded by their muscle,"" so they likely took extra precautions with security this time around. Even behind the big men in suits, Kim could be spotted from a mile away in a bright electric blue wrap coat featuring a waist tie and utilitarian pockets with her go-to biker shorts. Kardashian noted on Twitter that she wore Abloh's collection to the presentation.  Getty Images  Her husband, on the other hand, went with his signature athleisure-inspired look with a printed long sleeve tee that reads messages like ""There is only one freedom,"" ""I am loving,"" and ""Awareness.""  Kim's youngest sister Kylie Jenner was also present, wearing a similar bright ensemble. Her iteration, however, was a neon yellow jumpsuit. The trio sat together in the front row.    Getty Images  Kim went dark on social media and stayed out of the public eye after the robbery in her Paris hotel room almost two years ago. However, she eventually opened up about the experience on camera during Keeping Up with the Kardashians, where she recounted jarring details from the incident such as having the gun held up to her head, thinking she was going to die or get raped, being gagged with duct tape, realizing there was no way out, and fearing for her family.  After the episode aired, Kim reflected on the experience on Instagram. ""I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband. To my friends, family, and loved ones I can't thank you enough for being there when I needed you the most. To the French police, thank you for your incredible hard work,"" she wrote in her caption.",1

"The latest on Khloé Kardashian is heartbreaking. As the mother-of-one reels from news of Tristan Thompson’s cheating scandal, In Touch has uncovered exclusive new details — and secret footage — of another betrayal.  In Touch has obtained a video showing that the devastating situation is even worse than Khloé knows. An insider reveals the shocking details from Tristan’s hookups with a curvy stunner last November and again in February.  Tristan hit on the woman at an NYC club following a November game against the New York Knicks. And while the woman — who the source says is a big fan of the Kardashians — “knew that he was with Khloé,” Tristan didn’t mention his pregnant girlfriend when he brought her back to the Four Seasons in an SUV. He got out first and had her circle the block a few times before coming up to his room, where they had unprotected sex.  “She slept with him because he’s an NBA star, but she thinks he’s hot, too,” the insider says. “She said that the sex was good.” So good, the woman stayed the night and took a short video of Tristan — identifiable by his distinctive chest tattoos — asleep in bed afterward, which the source shared exclusively with In Touch.  “He was definitely not careful at all about making sure that nobody knew who she was or that she didn’t have her phone,” adds the source. In the video, two phones are visible on the nightstand. The source says they’re both Tristan’s, adding, “It’s so sketchy.”  In the morning, they swapped numbers for a potential round two. And the woman heard from Tristan right away — but he wasn’t looking for another hookup. He wanted to make sure she didn’t get pregnant! “He texted her, ‘Do you have Plan B?’” says the source, referencing the so-called morning-after pill.  Three months passed before they hooked up again. Out of the blue, Tristan texted the woman and invited her to see his team play in another city in February. “He paid for her flight,” says the source. “And she slept over again.”  For more on this exclusive story, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on newsstands now!

It’s not a fact that Jennifer Garner would be unknowingly of, and given Ben Affleck’s nanny drama and erratic eye, it’s formidable to suppose Jennifer purposefully putting another lady by what she went by with her (now) ex-husband.  However, it’s really easy to suppose Ben Affleck removing possessive and jealous, even yet their subdivision is all yet central now. He and Jennifer are clearly still articulate regularly, and a dual did try for some-more than a year to determine and get behind together.

"The feud continues between Miley and Selena! Despite the ‘Slow Down’ singer’s attempt to play nice, the former Disney darlings are still at war, a new report claims. Find out how Miley reacted to Selena’s plea that they make up.  Selena Gomez, 22, hoped the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party would be a chance for reconciliation with her old BFF Miley Cyrus, 22 — but the “Wrecking Ball” singer was far from willing to kiss and makeup. Get the scoop on Miley’s public rejection!  Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus Fight: Miley Rejects Plea To End Feud  At the celeb-filled post-Academy Awards party, Selena hoped she would be able to smooth things over with Miley, who she had a falling out with after staring a relationship with Nick Jonas, 22, Miley’s ex, in 2008. The feud worsened when Miley pulled a similar stunt, hooking up with Selena’s ex, Justin Bieber (and getting pregnant!) while the then-couple was on a break, Life & Style reports.  But, while the 22-year-old was willing to leave the boy drama in the past, Miley wasn’t on-board.  “She approached Miley at the party with a smile on her face to say hello,” a source tells the mag of the VF bash. “But Miley kept the convo short, and then left right after. It seemed like she didn’t want to be around Selena.”  Ouch! Poor Selena — considering she’s still so hung up on Justin, it must have taken a lot for her to try and make nice with Miley.

"Image caption Spears (right) has signed up as a judge on the US version of X Factor  Britney Spears was the all-American pop princess who shot to superstardom in her teens before a very public breakdown. Now, her appointment as a judge on the US X Factor represents a full return to the media spotlight.  The most stark illustration of how far Britney Spears had fallen came on 16 February 2007 when, after she spent just 24 hours in a rehabilitation clinic, the paparazzi tracked her down to a Los Angeles tattoo parlour - and discovered she was completely bald.  The act of shaving her head was a clear rejection of her former persona and of her life as a pop starlet in the public gaze.  Her meltdown came after eight years as the archetypal modern pop starlet - ""Miss American Dream since I was 17,"" as she put it in her 2007 single Piece of Me.  Image caption Spears achieved overnight success with her debut single in 1998  She found sudden fame as the blonde girl with pigtails and a school uniform in the video of her debut single ...Baby One More Time, a massive global hit.  Her first taste of the spotlight had come as one of the young cast of Disney's TV show All New Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake in 1994.  After her solo breakthrough, she became a fixture in the charts and in the gossip columns, but carefully cultivated a squeaky-clean image.  She had a three-year relationship with fellow Mouseketeer and pop star Justin Timberlake, but they split in 2002, with Timberlake's single Cry Me A River apparently an angry kiss-off to his former partner.  Spears focused on her career, ditching her songwriting team to work with stars such as R Kelly and Moby on her fourth album In The Zone in 2003.  She also courted the tabloids at the 2003 MTV Awards, where she locked lips with Madonna during a risque performance of Like A Virgin.  Image caption Madonna and Britney also collaborated on the single Me Against The Music  But perhaps more controversial was her union with childhood friend Jason Alexander, who she wed in a Las Vegas wedding chapel in January 2004.  The marriage was annulled after 55 hours, with Spears later explaining: ""I really wanted to see what it was like to be married.""  In July the same year she got engaged to her backing dancer Kevin Federline, just three months after meeting him.  Image caption Spears and Federline were married for just over two years  The couple tied the knot in September 2004 and the couple had two children.  But they divorced in 2006 and many fans, who had barely concealed their contempt for Federline, thought the split would mark a re-birth for Spears - whose recording career had been on hold since the marriage.  It was not to be.  Spears' behaviour became more erratic and she embarked on a prolonged period of partying with other young celebrities, including heiress Paris Hilton.  Shortly before her divorce, Spears gave a rambling television interview, in which she tearfully proclaimed her marriage ""awesome"" and blamed the media for making her an ""emotional wreck"".  The shaved head shocked her fans and Spears went back into rehab, this time staying for a month.  Image caption Spears shaved her own head with a set of clippers while onlookers watched through the window of a Los Angeles tattoo parlour  When she attempted a live comeback, performing at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2007, she stumbled through a lip-synced performance and was universally panned.  As Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong put it at the time, it was like ""watching a public execution"".  Her personal life was in chaos. After a 10-month custody battle, Federline won sole custody of the couple's children Sean Preston and Jayden James.  Image caption The star has been criticised for lip-syncing at her concerts  Spears' parenting skills were called into question when a judge in Los Angeles ordered her to undergo drug and alcohol tests twice a week.  A former bodyguard claimed the singer was a danger to her children. She was charged with hit-and-run after an incident in an LA car park, and was dropped by her management company.  Her parents blamed manager Sam Lutfi, whom they accused of controlling their daughter's life by drugging her and taking control of her finances. He has denied the claims.  Despite the MTV incident, she continued to win musical plaudits. Her fifth album Blackout, largely created by a crack team of pop producers, was sonically adventurous and a hit with fans.  The turning point in her personal life is regarded as coming the following year, when her father Jamie took control over decisions regarding her personal life, including food, clothing and medical care and finances.  Restraining orders were obtained against Lutfi and Spears' ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and her former manager Larry Rudolph was reinstated.  Image caption In 2011, MTV presented Spears with the Video Vanguard award, its equivalent of a lifetime achievement prize  Her next album, Circus, included the track Womanizer, which became her first US number one single since ...Baby One More Time and an accompanying world tour earned $131m (£82m).  Despite a private and public rehabilitation, at the end of 2010, her lawyers failed to overturn the ruling that gave her father full control over her affairs.  But this April, her fiance and former agent Jason Trawick became her joint guardian - with her father's blessing.  Now 30, the X Factor deal should provide an opportunity for the star to show that she has put her troubled past behind her.",1

Here's what's going on: TMZ recently reported that West wanted to trademark ""Donda,"" his late mother's name, for a cosmetics line. Hours later, HollywoodLies magically managed to have ""exclusive"" information all about it, including Kardashian's supposed reaction to his plans. But Gossip Cop has repeatedly been told that the disreputable outlet doesn't have real sources when it comes to the couple.  In fact, after HollywoodLife made up stories about Kardashian's robbery, we learned that the weloid doesn't even bother to fact-check its ""exclusives"" with the reality star's camp, instead choosing to publish unverified ""fabrication[s]."" And that appears to be what's happened here. A rep for Kardashian exclusively tells Gossip Cop the allegation she's upset with West is ""false.""",0
"Kris Jenner has made a career out of turning each of her children into superstars and entrepreneurs (as well as herself!) and she has no plans of slowing down any time soon.  “I don’t see myself retiring,” the world-famous momager, 61, told PEOPLE after coming off-stage at the WWD Apparel & Retail CEO Summit in New York City, where she discussed how she’s built an empire with her friend and business mentor and advisor, Tommy Hilfiger — the same day it was announced that she renewed her deal to continue filming Keeping Up With the Kardashians for a reported $150 million.  Kris Jenner JB Lacroix/ WireImage  “Being busy and working hard is instrumental in a long, healthy life,” she continued. “I really believe that. I think you have to take care of yourself and treat yourself well and have treats along the way and vacations and this and that. But I really think that working really hard for a long time is important. It’s important for your mind, body and spirit.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Wants to Help Kylie’s Business Continue to Thrive  And when it comes to striking the delicate balance between parenting and managing, Jenner has a very specific approach: “I’m always Mom first,” she said.  RELATED: Kylie Jenner Made $420 Million in First 18 Months of Her Kylie Cosmetics Business, Kris Jenner Says  “I love my kids more than anything, and it gives me such joy to see that they’re following the path they love,” she continued. “And they’re all really smart kids with amazing work ethics. That makes my job heaven because I don’t have to babysit anybody. They’re telling me, ‘Let’s do more. Faster. Bigger.’”  Tommy Hilfiger and Kris Jenner at the WWD Apparel & Retail CEO Summit in N.Y.C. Patrick MacLeod for WWD  However, there are challenges to being the CEO of your children, she admitted.  “It’s a little bit like a juggle and every day you work for a different company,” she explained. “But that’s the exciting part. It’s difficult but it’s exciting because there’s always something going on. Every day it’s some big corporate fabulous thing that we’re doing, or working on our individual beauty lines and clothing lines. I sometimes feel like a bit of a fireman because I’m always putting out fires. So it’s kind of got a double-edge sword. But it’s exciting. And I love it. It’s very satisfying.”  Plus, she’s noticed her children approach business differently, from Kylie’s cosmetics company to Khloé’s Good American denim label to Kim’s beauty label to Kendall’s modeling career to Kourtney’s partnerships to Rob’s sock line and beyond.

Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  “Everybody definitely has their own business style and they have their own way of doing things,” she said. “My job to navigate is really letting them be who they truly are and letting them find their pace and find what works for them. And they’re all really smart kids who seem to have a great sense of direction into how to market whatever they’re doing to their fans and their followers. And I think we’re learning from each other all the time, which is really great.”  At this point, Jenner works tirelessly to make every wish come true for her children—but what about her? “I’m up for anything,” she said. “I love to work. I’m driven to do things and I get great satisfaction doing amazing things for my kids. I think I’d love one day to do a clothing line … the possibilities are endless. I think we can do anything we set our minds to.”  For more of our exclusive interview with Kris Jenner, pick up the new issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.",0
"Kára McCullough, Miss District of Columbia, was crowned Miss USA 2017 during the sparkly pageant Sunday night in Las Vegas. And while it would be wholly reasonable for her to spend this next week in bed (or at least on a couch in sweatpants, maybe sequinned sweatpants) relaxing and eating carbs, in the day and a half since her victory, she's upped and moved to New York City and begun an already-intense round of media appearances. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, after all, even if Kára says that crown is actually super light.  As her first in-depth interview, Kára spoke with Cosmopolitan.com on Tuesday morning. Read on for her take on the controversy surrounding her Q&A moments, both health care and ""equalism,"" as well as what she's most looking forward to now she's in NYC. OK, it's street food, but guess what kind?!  So, you’re coming off just a kind of busy weekend, you know? How are you feeling this morning?!  I'm well. I feel well-rested! I looked in the mirror this morning, and I was like, Whoa, I am Miss USA. And it just hit me [for the first time] like a ton of bricks. This entire experience has been so life-changing. And it’s just begun! I'm just so excited. I know there'll be tiring days coming up, but I'm really energized. I think the two bags of green tea that went in my cup this morning are really helping.  What does the crown feel like?  Oh my goodness. It feels like a halo. If I could really explain it, it’s like that halo Snapchat filter; just imagine that. It’s so light, and I just can’t even believe that I’ve been honored and graced with this opportunity to wear it.  Courtesy of Miss USA  During the live broadcast, was there a moment when you went from being “confidently beautiful” to, say, confident you could win?  Well, I showed up to win! But really, I think [that moment] came when they called me for top three. I was the first one [called]. I remember standing on the little box that they had us positioned on, and I just lifted my head and asked God for guidance, and just let him know I was extremely thankful. I think that was like my turning point, like OK, Kára, you could really have this in the bag. You could take this all the way back to D.C.  Last year’s Miss USA, Deshauna Barber, was also Miss District of Columbia. Was that something that ever psyched you out or made you second-guess your chances?  Absolutely. There were like a lot of naysayers in my ear, saying, ""Ah, bad luck, states don't win back-to-back."" But I had to let them know Drake put that out there in the universe for us and [D.C.] came back strong. Deshauna is just such a phenomenal person and she really broke so many pageant stereotypes. I'm just so thankful to have her as a sister, a friend, and a mentor — and her crowing me is by far one of the most honorable achievements that I've had.  In many respects, I think you’re also breaking some of those “pageant stereotypes” — your career in nuclear sciences, for example. How did you get into that line of work?  I have a degree in chemistry [with a concentration] in radiochemistry from South Carolina State University, and I started my career at the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013. My day-to-day job now involves nuclear licensing and regulations; the agency focuses on emergency preparedness for nuclear energy domestically.  I can't even begin to tell you how much [my colleagues] have supported me. Initially I kept it a secret that I ran for Miss D.C. USA, but someone shared it on Facebook, and then the word got out, and there’s been a real outpouring [of love]. Everyone has been great.  Will promoting the sciences be part of your Miss USA platform?  Absolutely. [I run] a self-funded program called Science Exploration for Kids, which encourages students to find joy in the STEM subjects, as well as a career path. I run after-school programs and tutoring sessions and symposiums. It’s about any or all of the sciences, although I am biased; I love to see people major in chemistry — because the numbers [in that field] are so low. I was actually the only person in my class to graduate with a degree in radiochemistry, and so every summer, I had a phenomenal internship and I got paid! That's why I always try to encourage students to find joy in science, because the opportunities are endless. And I love getting to see children having fun and enjoying their projects, and I just hope to expand their imagination through science.  Do you have a go-to experiment to pique kids’ interest from the get-go?  My favorite one I call an ""explosion of colors.” It’s about how soap reacts with, like, fatty acids, and what I do is take a plate, fill the plate up with milk, and then put food coloring— your favorite colors, of course— in the middle of the plate. Then I’ll take a Q-tip with some soaps [on it] and put it right smack down in the middle of the plate amid the food coloring, and you'll see how the soap interacts with the milk. Basically, [the chemical reaction happening] makes the colors just spiral everywhere.  I have to confess I hated science in school but I do like pretty colors.  I'm going to make you love it. You'll come over and we're going to do some projects together.  What’s been the response from your friends and family since the big win?  I literally have 500 text messages on my phone right now. It might have gone up to 600 actually — all my family and friends were saying, ""Kára you’ve always been someone who is chasing after their dreams and actually executing them,"" and they're like, ""You're encouraging people in so many ways that you don't even see."" Hearing comments like that is extremely gratifying, because you often don't realize the [impact] that you have on other people. I’m just on cloud nine. I'm so thankful for all the support.  Somewhat on the flip side though, there’s been some controversy surrounding answers in the Q&A round and the “final word” segment. Is that something you’re aware of?  You know, social media [functions] at a hyperactive rate, and you can get messages and feedback instantly. I think [the response] is good because it shows that, for one, I’m starting a dialogue with important issues around our nation, right? And two, it’s amazing that people are sharing their opinions. There are going to be pros and cons, and there’s going to be two sides [to every argument], and I’m just thankful that at least there is some conversation.  Getty Images  Totally. I think, in 30 or 45 seconds, it can be really difficult to unpack your opinion on a hot-button issue. Is there anything you’d like to clarify, or expand on, regarding your answers about health care as a privilege, or your stance on feminism vs. “equalism”?  As a scientist, first of all, we’re very long-winded. If it were up to me that would have been a four-hour long discussion [about health care]. But I own what I say, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to speak on something so important [even for] 30 seconds. But thank you, if I have the opportunity just to clarify, I would definitely love to let people know that, yes I am privileged to have health insurance — it’s a privilege for me, and I’m thankful for that. But I also do believe health insurance is a right for everyone.  And I’m all about women’s rights. Yes, I would have to say I am a feminist. But, when I look at the term ""equalism,"" [I used it] because I’ve seen firsthand in the workplace that we need those equal opportunities when it comes to leadership. And you know, the word [feminism] can carry different connotations [depending on what] generation you come from, or what background, but I don’t want anyone to think I’m not an active [supporter of] women’s rights. If anyone wants to challenge me on that, please call me. There are multitudes of women working at the Nuclear Regulatory commission, for example, making so many strides in leadership. And I support them 100 percent. Go to my social media pages and you’ll see I give shout-outs to so many of my colleagues, because I look up to them. They really embody what a hard-working woman is, someone who doesn’t take no for an answer, who’s very unapologetic about her leadership and her abilities.  Have you ever experienced discrimination in the workplace, or while competing in pageants? For many people, the stereotypes of pageants being old-fashioned and, say, a bitchy competitive environment remain.  Well, I believe that I hold my own and I know if I need to speak up for myself, I will do that. If I feel as if something isn’t equal, then I will speak out on my own behalf.  [With pageants], there are those old stereotypes, but what people have to understand, and I know many people do know, is with time comes change. I know that the paradigm has changed — look at this year’s Miss USA, every woman on that stage is accomplished, and when I say accomplished, oh my goodness. [First runner-up] Miss New Jersey is a phenomenal woman! She was actually a friend prior to the competition and just standing up there with her [at the end], I think either of us would have been satisfied [with either outcome].  So when do you start preparing for Miss Universe — you’ve just moved to New York also, right? So much going on!  Yes, honestly [I love] just seeing the bodegas everywhere! I love a good cheesesteak — I know that’s [supposed to be] a Philly thing, but New York just seems to have it going on. And I think D.C. is a little bit slower [of a city], so the best part about New York for me is that it just never sleeps. I've wanted to live here for a couple years now so I’ve hit the ground running. I've seen clips [from Miss USA] online but I would love to watch the whole show back to see where I can improve. I don’t think there’s going a moment of down time and I’m excited. If you’re not busy, what are you really getting done?  OK, this is too good: Are we going to see a cheesesteak-themed national costume at Miss Universe, then?! Please say yes.  I’ll be in a gyro-themed suit, with chopped cheese on the side. [Laughs.] That might not actually be a bad idea. I’ll make sure to tag you in the Instagram credits.  This interview has been edited and condensed.",1
"Just because two people are in love and are great together doesn't mean the idea of marriage should continuously be forced upon them. For example, once again, Jennifer Lopez has said she's not marrying Alex Rodriguez — at this point in time. The marriage question is one the World of Dance judge is repeatedly asked. It's also an exhausting topic that Lopez should no longer have to discuss during every interview.  During Thursday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, host Ellen DeGeneres brought up Lopez's relationship with Rodriguez and the possibility of the two saying ""I do."" DeGeneres began the conversation by telling J. Lo and referring to A-Rod, ""He said that y'all are gonna be getting married.""  The former Shades of Blue star quickly denied that statement by declaring, ""He did not say that. He did not say that.""  The two went back and forth a bit in a joking manner about Rodriguez's supposed declaration of marriage. But, that wasn't enough to stop DeGeneres from, once again, asking Lopez, ""So, you'll be getting married?""  The multifaceted Lopez answered, ""I don't know. I don't know."" DeGeneres pushed further by stating, ""You should, cuz y'all seem very happy."" The Second Act star agreed with the latter. ""We are,"" she said. ""We've been together a couple years, it's nice.""  TheEllenShow on YouTube  Of course, DeGeneres didn't stop there and said about them having a wedding, ""It would be good to do for Christmas.""  However, rather than giving a verbal response, Lopez reacted with the most telling facial expression. Here it is:  At this point of the marriage conversation, Lopez was still laughing and going along with DeGeneres, but it also seemed like she didn't know what else to say. It was almost like The Fosters executive producer was ready to move on to something else.  Was DeGeneres mainly teasing? Yes. Is she happy for the duo and wants them to live a beautiful life together? Of course. Does she really care or is trying to force them to get married? No. The interview was all in good fun and one Lopez took extremely well. That said, it has to get old reciting the same thing over and over again about your personal relationship.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a Harper's Bazaar interview published on March 15, Lopez once again said about getting married, ""I do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now. It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well.""  Then, during a June 11 Good Morning America interview, Lopez said about marrying Rodriguez, ""We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and ... we're mature now."" She continued,  ""We're grown ups and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace. And our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work we're truly blessed. We don't need anything more right now.""  How many more times does she need to say it? They are content with the current status of their relationship. The two certainly aren't in any rush to walk down the aisle. Even if someone's just joking around with Lopez and Rodriguez about marriage, having to repeatedly field those types of questions and to reaffirm their happiness is tiring. Let's all just let them enjoy their relationship without the pressure of marriage.",1
"Kim Kardashian is back to doing what she does best: posting photos of herself on Instagram in relatively little-to-no clothing, and giving no effs about it. Because why should she?

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jul 20, 2018 at 11:28am PDT  But while Kim in a bikini isn't exactly breaking news, her caption (read: ""I'm really shy..."") essentially amounts to her trolling herself.

"Is Leonardo DiCaprio facing the midlife crisis?  The Titanic star's name has recently been dragged by a magazine and claimed the 43-year-old star is becoming anti-social day by day.  Also read: Spielberg trailer: Leonardo DiCaprio, Liam Neeson and more pay respect to the great film maker in HBO's new documentary  An insider told the magazine that the actor is becoming antisocial these days because he has ""developed major trust issues"" and is ""totally paranoid.""  The magazine further claimed that DiCaprio, whose name has been involved with various supermodels and even with his Titanic co-star Kate Winslet lately, is no more interested in love life as well.  ""He used to be the life of the party. Now he won't let any woman near him,"" the source further claimed.  Gossip Cop looked over the matter and busted the website for making up false news about the Inception actor as some of the actors' close pals called the magazine's report as 'nonsense.'  Given that, the actor was recently spotted attending Drake's birthday party in Los Angeles with his pals Jamie Foxx and Tobey Maguire.  Besides that, last week he was also joined by Robert Pattinson and The Weeknd for his own birthday party at The Highlight Room in LA. A few weeks ago, he was spotted hanging out with a bunch of friends in New York City as well.  Thus, it is clear that the star is neither antisocial nor developing major trust issues.

"George Timothy Clooney (born May 6, 1961) is an American actor, director, producer, screenwriter, and businessman. He has received three Golden Globe Awards for his work as an actor and two Academy Awards, one for acting in Syriana (2006) and the other for co-producing Argo (2012).  Clooney made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the long-running medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. While working on ER, he began attracting a variety of leading roles in films, including the superhero film Batman & Robin (1997) and the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), in which he first worked with director Steven Soderbergh, who would become a long-time collaborator. In 1999, he took the lead role in Three Kings, a well-received war satire set during the Gulf War.  In 2001, Clooney's fame widened with the release of his biggest commercial success, the heist comedy remake Ocean's Eleven, the first of what became a trilogy starring Clooney. He made his directorial debut a year later with the biographical spy comedy Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and has since directed the historical drama Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), the sports comedy Leatherheads (2008), the political drama The Ides of March (2011), and the war film The Monuments Men (2014). Clooney won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the Middle East thriller Syriana (2005), and subsequently earned Best Actor nominations for the legal thriller Michael Clayton (2007) and the comedy-dramas Up in the Air (2009) and The Descendants (2011). In 2013, he received the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing the political thriller Argo. He is the only person who has been nominated for Academy Awards in six different categories.[3]  In 2009, Clooney was included in Time's annual Time 100 as one of the ""Most Influential People in the World"".[4] He is also noted for his political and economic activism, and has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since January 31, 2008.[5][6][7] His humanitarian work includes his advocacy of finding a resolution for the Darfur conflict, raising funds for the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Armenian Genocide recognition, 2004 tsunami, 9/11 victims, and creating documentaries such as Sand and Sorrow to raise awareness about international crises. Clooney helped fund the March for Our Lives after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[8] In 2013, Clooney co-founded Casamigos Tequila with Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman.[9] It was sold to Diageo for $700 million in June 2017, with an additional $300 million possible depending on the company's performance over the next ten years.[10] According to Forbes annual ranking, he was the world's highest-paid actor for 2017-2018, scoring a career-high pretax paycheck of $239 million between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018.[11] Since September 27, 2014, he has been married to British human rights lawyer Amal Clooney (née Alamuddin).  Early life  Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky.[12][13] His mother, Nina Bruce (née Warren),[14] was a beauty queen and city councilwoman. His father, Nick Clooney, is a former anchorman and television host, including five years on the AMC network.[15] Clooney has Irish, German, and English ancestry.[16] His maternal great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Ann Sparrow, was the half-sister of Nancy Lincoln, mother of President Abraham Lincoln.[17][18][19] Clooney has an older sister named Adelia (known as Ada).[20] Cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney was an aunt.[12] Through Rosemary, his cousins include actors Miguel Ferrer, Rafael Ferrer, and Gabriel Ferrer, who is married to singer Debby Boone.[21]  Clooney was raised a strict Roman Catholic,[22] but said in 2006 that he did not know if he believed ""in Heaven, or even God"".[23] He has said, ""Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group.""[24] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Columbus, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade.[25] In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a medical condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that ""yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed.""[24] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: ""It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you.""[26]  After his parents moved to Augusta, Kentucky, Clooney attended Augusta High School. He has stated that he earned all As and a B in school,[12] and played baseball and basketball. He tried out to play professional baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 1977, but he did not pass the first round of player cuts and was not offered a contract.[27] He attended Northern Kentucky University from 1979 to 1981, majoring in broadcast journalism, and very briefly attended the University of Cincinnati, but did not graduate from either.[28] He earned money selling women's shoes, insurance door-to-door, stocking shelves, working in construction, and cutting tobacco.[23][29]  Career  Early work, 1978–1993  Clooney's first role was as an extra in the television mini-series Centennial in 1978, which was based on the novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was partly filmed in Clooney's hometown of Augusta, Kentucky.[30][31] Clooney's first major role came in 1984 in the short-lived sitcom E/R (not to be confused with ER, the better-known hospital drama, on which Clooney also co-starred a decade later). He played a handyman on the series The Facts of Life and appeared as Bobby Hopkins, a detective, on an episode of The Golden Girls. His first prominent role was a semi-regular supporting role in the sitcom Roseanne, playing Roseanne Barr's supervisor Booker Brooks, followed by the role of a construction worker on Baby Talk, a co-starring role on the CBS drama Bodies of Evidence as Detective Ryan Walker, and then a year-long turn as Det. James Falconer on Sisters. In 1988, Clooney played a role in the comedy-horror film Return of the Killer Tomatoes.[32] In 1990, he starred in the short-lived ABC police drama Sunset Beat.[33] During this period, Clooney was a student at the Beverly Hills Playhouse acting school for five years.[34]  Breakthrough, 1994–1999  Clooney rose to fame when he played Dr. Doug Ross, alongside Anthony Edwards, Julianna Margulies, and Noah Wyle, on the hit NBC medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999. After leaving the series in 1999, he made a cameo appearance in the 6th season and returned for a guest spot in the show's final season.[35] For his work on the series, Clooney received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1995 and 1996.[36][37] He also earned three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 1995, 1996, and 1997 (losing to co-star Anthony Edwards).[38][39]  Clooney began appearing in films while working on ER. His first major Hollywood role was in the horror comedy-crime thriller From Dusk till Dawn, directed by Robert Rodriguez and co-starring Harvey Keitel. He followed its success with the romantic comedy One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer, and the action-thriller The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman. Clooney was then cast as Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which was a modest box office performer, but a critical failure (with Clooney himself calling the film ""a waste of money"").[40] In 1998, he co-starred in the crime-comedy Out of Sight opposite Jennifer Lopez, marking the first of his many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.[41] He also starred in Three Kings during the last weeks of his contract with ER.[42]  After ER, 2000–2010  After leaving ER, Clooney starred in the commercially successful films The Perfect Storm (2000), a disaster drama; and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a Coen brothers adventure comedy. In 2001, he teamed up with Soderbergh again for the heist comedy Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960s Rat Pack film of the same name, with Clooney playing Danny Ocean, originally portrayed by Frank Sinatra. It is Clooney's most successful film with him in the lead role, earning $451 million worldwide (he appeared, but did not star, in Gravity, which has a $723 million worldwide box office).[44][45] The film inspired two sequels starring Clooney, Ocean's Twelve in 2004[46] and Ocean's Thirteen in 2007.[47]  In 2001, Clooney and Soderbergh co-founded Section Eight Productions, for which Grant Heslov was president of television.

SSP aims to monitor armed activity for signs of renewed civil war between Sudan and South Sudan, and to detect and deter mass atrocities along the border regions there.[90]  Clooney and John Prendergast co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed piece in May 2011, titled ""Dancing with a dictator in Sudan"", arguing that:  President Omar al-Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, is escalating bombing and food aid obstruction in Darfur, and he now threatens the entire north-south peace process ... the evidence shows that incentives alone are insufficient to change Khartoum's calculations. International support should be sought immediately for denying debt relief, expanding the ICC indictments, diplomatically isolating the regime, suspending all non-humanitarian aid, obstructing state-controlled bank transactions and freezing accounts holding oil wealth diverted by senior regime officials.[91]  On March 16, 2012, Clooney was arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy for civil disobedience.[92][93] He intended to be arrested when he planned the protest.[93] Several other prominent participants were also arrested, including Martin Luther King III.[93] Clooney has been described as one of the most strident critics of Omar al-Bashir.[94]  Armenian Genocide  George Clooney is a keen supporter of the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. He is one of the chief associates of the 100 Lives Initiative, a project which aims to remember the lives lost during the event.[95] As part of the initiative, Clooney launched the Aurora Prize, which awards to those who risk their lives to prevent genocides and atrocities.[95][96] Clooney had also urged various American government officials to support the United States' recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[96] Clooney visited Armenia to commemorate the 101st anniversary of the event in April 2016.[97]  Syria  In May 2015, Clooney told the BBC that the Syrian conflict was too complicated politically to get involved in and he wanted to focus on helping the refugees.[98] In March 2016, he and his wife, Amal Clooney, met with Syrian refugees living in Berlin to mark the fifth anniversary of the conflict, before meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to thank her for her Germany's open-door policy.[99]  Gun control  In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[100]  Personal life  Relationships  Clooney married actress Talia Balsam in 1989; they divorced in 1993.[101]  Clooney and Alamuddin at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in 2016  Clooney became engaged to British-Lebanese human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin on April 28, 2014.[102][103] In July 2014, Clooney publicly criticized the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail after it claimed his fiancée's mother opposes their marriage on religious grounds.[104] When the tabloid apologized for its false story, Clooney refused to accept the apology. He called the paper ""the worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers.""[105] On August 7, 2014, Clooney and Alamuddin obtained marriage licenses at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea of the United Kingdom.[106] Alamuddin and Clooney were officially married on September 27, 2014, at Ca' Farsetti.[107] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome.[108] In 2015, Clooney and Alamuddin adopted a rescue dog, a bassett hound named Millie, from the San Gabriel Valley Humane Society.[109] On February 9, 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show, The Talk, that Amal was pregnant, and that they were expecting twins.[110] On June 6, 2017, Amal gave birth to a daughter, Ella, and a son, Alexander.[111]  Real estate  Clooney's main home is in Los Angeles.

However, Clooney has also lent his voice to South Park as Sparky the Dog in ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"" and as the emergency room doctor in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Clooney was caricatured in the American Dad! episode ""Tears of a Clooney"", in which Francine Smith plans to destroy him.[134]  Director Alexander Cartio made his debut feature film, Convincing Clooney, about a Los Angeles artist who, faced with rejection as an actor and screenwriter, arrives at a master plan trying to get Clooney to star in his first-ever low-budget short film.

"Baby on the way! Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm.  The former WWE wrester, 38, and the businessman, 43, secretly tied the knot in March 2014. They welcomed their first child, daughter Ava Grace, now 3, that August.  Three months after giving birth to their daughter, Keibler, who dated actor George Clooney from 2011 to 2013, revealed she never thought about marriage or parenthood until she started a relationship with her now-husband.  “Life can be unpredictable. You feel one way, and then … boom!” Keibler wrote on her lifestyle blog in December 2014. “You need to entirely change your perspective. That is certainly what happened to me this past year. Until I started dating Jared, the idea of being married and having a family was never on my radar. I was just hoping that the right love would find me.”  “But after a serendipitous reconnection with Jared, a friend who turned out to be my soulmate, we created a family together almost instantly,” she continued. “Talk about a serious change in my reality! This year and the holiday season especially has me feeling so nostalgic about family — my family, my new family, and of course, the newest addition to our family. Ava has graced us with such joy, such light and such love–we never saw it coming. She is our special little lady, and I couldn’t be more thankful for how she has opened my heart.”  The Dancing With the Stars season 2 alum has maintained a low profile since becoming a mother. In addition to shutting down her blog, Keibler has not updated her Instagram account since September 2015. The last post she shared on the social media platform was of herself reading a book titled “What Does It Mean to Be Kind?” to Ava.  Clooney, for his part, also started a family after his split from Keibler. The Oscar winner, 57, welcomed twins Alexander and Ella in June 2017 with his wife, Amal Clooney, whom he wed in September 2014.

"CLOSE Reality TV star Chris Soules appeared in court Monday as his lawyers argued the charge against him should be dropped. Pool video  A Buchanan County judge dismissed a contempt of court charge against former KWWL reporter Elizabeth Amanieh on Thursday. (Photo: Special to the Register)  A judge has dismissed contempt of court charges against a former reporter for an eastern Iowa news station who took video of a court appearance by ""The Bachelor"" star Chris Soules.  Elizabeth Amanieh, a former reporter for KWWL, an NBC affiliate station based in Waterloo, took video of Soules in April 2017 during his initial appearance.  Authorities say Soules was involved in a hit and run in April in Aurora, a small town in Buchanan County, when he rear-ended 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, who was driving a tractor. Soules allegedly left the scene after calling 911. Mosher died in the accident.  Soules was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal car crash, a class D felony. If convicted, he could face as many as five years in prison. His trial is set to begin Nov. 7.  Buchanan County District Court Judge Fae Hoover-Grinde on Thursday dismissed the contempt charge against Elizabeth Amanieh. Hoover-Grinde found prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Elizabeth Amanieh willfully violated another judge's order not to record video of the proceeding, said Amanieh's attorneys, Tom Frerichs and Eric Tindal.  ""For her to recognize that was huge for me because I felt like my voice was finally heard,"" Amanieh told the Register in an interview Monday.  More on the Chris Soules case:  Iowa allows journalists to record video, audio and take photographs if they have prior approval. Prosecutors in the case say Judge Linda Fangman had told Amanieh that only photos could be taken during the trial. But prosecutors said that the reporter used her cellphone to take video of Soules' initial appearance.  Hours after the hearing, the district's chief judge, Kellyann Lekar, signed an order retroactively approving expanded media coverage for the hearing. That order was requested by the media coordinator at KWWL's urging, amid confusion about Fangman's order. KWWL then aired and posted the video.  The Buchanan County Attorney's Office filed a complaint saying Amanieh was in contempt of court.  In a news release, Amanieh expressed relief that the case was dismissed. But she also said KWWL executives asked her to film on her cellphone and later posted the video, though she was uncomfortable with the actions.  ""I only did everything my news director at the time, Shane Moreland, directed me to do,"" Amanieh said in the release. ""I was simply following orders when I received direction from KWWL-TV management to record video on my cellphone. When the judge ... told me she did not want that video to be seen anywhere, I got on the phone and called my boss, telling him I was going to delete the video.""  Amanieh said KWWL management told her not to delete the video and later asked Lekar for permission to use the video.  ""KWWL may have been wrong in ordering me to record video on my phone, but they also took no ownership of their actions,"" Amanieh said in the release. ""Even though I followed the directions of KWWL management, they used me as a scapegoat. Instead of standing beside me, they covered up their own actions at every step.""  When asked if she would pursue legal action against the station, Amanieh said ""as of this moment, we are just looking at our options.""  Jim McKernan, KWWL's vice president and general manager, on Monday took issue with some of the information he's seen reported on the case, but said the station would not comment further.  ""Some of the reporting and some of the opinions as represented so far in the press are not correct,"" he said, declining to elaborate.  Moreland did not immediately respond Monday to a message seeking comment.  Read or Share this story: https://dmreg.co/2O8fZx9",1

"The collective internet seems to have already passed judgment on Katy Perry’s new track, “Swish Swish,” which is raising eyebrows over its possible lyrical shots at Taylor Swift. Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about “anyone we know.” While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of “Swish Swish” is “liberation” from bullies.  “I think it’s a great anthem for people to use whenever someone’s trying to hold you down or bully you,” she said. “That’s kind of what this record is about, it’s just like [a] 360-degree liberation.” If “Chained to the Rhythm” was about “political liberation” and “Bon Appétit” was a “sexual liberation,” then Perry calls “Swish Swish” “the liberation from all the negative that doesn’t serve you.”  Perry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. “Here’s some of the tea and a biscuit,” she tweeted.  Morning! Here's some of the tea and a biscuit ☕️https://t.co/7I50PYq66Z — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 20, 2017  Since “Swish Swish” dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. “I’ve always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That’s not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],” Rose wrote in a series of tweets.  RELATED: Celebrity Feuds: A look at famous Hollywood fights  Perry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift’s 1989 hit “Bad Blood” has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was “not my question to answer — if it’s about me.”  She further explained, “I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that’s calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can’t mistake kindness for weakness and don’t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that’s not to any one person and don’t quote me that it is, because it’s not. It’s not about that.”  Watch her latest explanation of “Swish Swish” on The Tonight Show above.",1
"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'",0

Despite a 47-year age difference, Caitlyn Jenner, 68, and Sophia Hutchins, 21, have been spending quite a bit of time together lately, and now, there are rumors that they may even be getting married! “They consider each other soul mates and freely admit they couldn’t imagine a life with anyone else at this point,” an insider tells RadarOnline.

Recently, they’ve been photographed out and about together quite a bit, although they’ve never confirmed any reports of a romance.  Like Caitlyn, Sophia is a transgender woman. She came out with her decision to transition in a 2016 article in her school newspaper at Pepperdine University. It is rumored that Sophia is living with Caitlyn in Malibu, with those reports fueled by several photos taken in Caitlyn’s home on Sophia’s Instagram page. The women recently attended the Erasing the Stigma Leadership Awards together on April 26, as well as the GLAAD Media Awards earlier that month.",0

"Taylor Swift, Katy Perry.  It’s been quite the month in Katy Perry news: She gave a boy his first kiss on American Idol and has been embroiled in a legal battle with a group of nuns over property in L.A. But amid all of that, Perry is still giving the people what they really want — reasons to believe she dislikes Taylor Swift.  When a contestant on American Idol apologized to Perry for saying that he loved Swift and looked up to her as a musician, Perry said, “I love her, as a songwriter, as well.” Then she made a face most accurately described as “¯\_(ツ)_/¯” and looked away.  The two singers have been publicly feuding since Swift called them “enemies” in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview. They’ve been fueling the feud fire ever since, most recently when Perry may have seduced Karlie Kloss away from Swift’s girl gang. But hey, she loves Swift as a songwriter still!",0
"Nicki Minaj breaks social media silence, teases new songs April 11th, 2018 | by Yusuf Zay Celebrity After months of silence and seclusion, you wouldn’t believe what the cat dragged in. Yes, people, our favourite female rapper is back online!  Nicki Minaj has resurfaced on social media to tease two new songs.  The star shared a photo of herself clad in a Fendi outfit that is reminiscent of the style of Chun-Li from the game, Street Fighter. And in another photo, Minaj showed off her eccentric style in a hoodie underneath a large ball gown dress fit for royalty, while surrounded by other people wearing similar outfits and sporting doll masks.  She teased her followers with a possible release date for the two songs by captioning the photos with Thursday’s date.  This isn’t the first time she has taken to Twitter to suggest she will be dropping music in the near future. Eagle-eyed Barbz noticed on Sunday that the Anaconda singer tweeted the number four, before quickly deleting it.  She repeated this process on Monday, but with the number three, which sparked a frenzy of speculation that she was counting down to a potential release.  Her mysterious tweets come nearly five months since the Superbass singer was last active on social media save for a few promotional ads.  In these last few months, she appears to have been taking her time to create new music. Just last year, Minaj told Dazed magazine her next album would be “a billion times more epic than anything ‘Anaconda’ could have delivered.”  Whatever Nicki is cooking, we can’t wait to see. We’re counting down to the big release as well.  Source: E! News",1
"Game of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie's highly-anticipated wedding finally has an official date—and it's coming up very soon.  The couple will wed in less than a month, on June 23, according to a BBC report.  Per BBC: ""A 23 June date has been posted at the Huntly registration office in Aberdeenshire. The actress's father, councillor Seb Leslie, owns a castle in his West Garioch constituency.""  Harington and Leslie, who first met in 2012 on the set of hit HBO drama, announced their engagement last fall with an official announcement in the newspaper, which was absolutely adorable and old-fashioned.  Getty Images  ""MR. K.C. HARINGTON AND MISS R.E. LESLIE. The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughters of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire,"" the announcement read.    As famous couples go, Harington and Leslie are relatively low-key, but they have spoken publicly about their romance on a few occasions.  Notably, Harington described falling in love with Leslie on set during a 2016 interview with L'Uomo Vogue. ""Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,"" he said. ""If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.""    Harington also opened up about his less-than-perfect proposal during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show in October 2017.  ""I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,"" he said, laughing. ""Sorry, that’s a really bad expression!""",1

Not only that, but sister Jamie Lynn Spears made a surprise appearance, taking part in a performance medley of her older sibling's hits.  Jamie Lynn presented Britney with the first-ever Icon Award and joined Kelsea Ballerini , Sofia Carson and Hailee Steinfeld for a medley of ""...Baby One More Time,"" ""Circus"" and ""Till the World Ends.""

"The torch track is “about a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,” he says.  The drought is broken: Sam Smith is back with his first new music in two years. The British soulman returns with “Too Good At Goodbyes,” his first release since 2015’s “Writing’s On The Wall” from Spectre, which became the first James Bond theme to hit No. 1 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart.  Written with longstanding collaborator Jimmy Napes and Stargate, ""Too Good At Goodbyes"" builds into a gospel chorus and showcases Smith's exceptional range. The torch track is “about a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,” says Smith. “It's been a long while since I've put any music out and I feel that this first single sets the tone of what is to come.”  On it, Smith sings ""Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry / And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry / And every time you walk out, the less I love you / Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true,"" hitting high notes which suggest he's put behind him the vocal cord injury which plagued him in 2015.  Smith is coming off a spectacular start to his recording career. His debut album In The Lonely Hour was a smash, hitting No. 1 in the U.K. and shifting more than 12 million units worldwide. He’s gone on to collect an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, three Brit Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and four Grammys.  In support of his new release, Smith will play four dates later this month at venues yet to be confirmed. He’ll start Sept. 11 in Los Angeles, then head east with stops in New York (Sept. 13), London (Sept. 15) and, finally, Berlin (Sept. 18).  Listen to “Too Good At Goodbyes” below.

"Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani and have no engagement and only hunt, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can handle this story exclusively. A representative confirms that the allegations are both wrong and fabricated.  Hollywood Life allegedly claims to have ""exclusive details"" about how Stefani and Shelton ""could renounce an engagement and make the covenant."" A so-called ""source close to Gwen"" is quoted as saying: ""They talk about it all the time and that's how they live together [sic] as if they were already married."" This alleged snitch goes on to say, ""With her busy deadline, Gwen even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just one Beach or somewhere in the country to loft, if the romantic mood is right. ""  Obviously, the site is unaware that a couple can be engaged and still run away, so these claims make no sense. In the sense of Dictionary.com ""elope"" means ""secretly run away to be married"". It does not exclude an engagement. It rather means marriage, which is held without knowledge or participation of other people. Of course, this is more than just terminology.  While the blog claims that the performers could ""skip"" an engagement, she has already spread several stories about her becoming engaged. If you look at just the last year, there are at least four stories that contradict this current narrative (see screengrabs of the headlines below). For example, in May 2017, the website claimed that Stefani wanted Shelton to suggest that she use her ""The Voice"" downtime to plan a wedding. By October, the store speculated that the country superstar had ""secretly suggested"" and they were engaged after Stefani was seen in a ""giant diamond ring"".  Then in December, there was an article by HollywoodLies, as he's called ""They'll never marry if they're not engaged in 2018"" and continue to say, ""If there's no ring on Gwen's finger by the end of the new year, the couple can take the marriage forever off the table. "" This latest piece, the ""source"" mentioned, calls the marriage between Shelton and Stefani ""inevitable."" That's not all. In February, the site claimed Shelton was shopping for a diamond ring, which was to be used in a ""Valentine's Day Proposal"".  Valentine's Day has clearly come and gone without any suggestion, so HollywoodLies is now pretending it has never made such an assertion or any of the others, so it may offer this new tale to ""skip"" an engagement. But journalism does not work in a vacuum. Consistency shows credibility. And the blog's own story shows that it's not believable. It is also noteworthy that HollywoodLies first alleged Shelton and Stefani broke through in 2015. A similar claim was made last November, and they still did. This also shows that the website is untrustworthy.  And that's not all. A few days ago, the outlet uncovered a false cover story Life & Style about Stefani, who is not just pregnant, but is also planning a wedding in Mexico that will feature celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. This new ""Exclusive"" does not mention pregnancy and does not explain what happened to the supposed plans for a star wedding. Regardless of whether the publication claims there will be a wedding or a secret ceremony, HollywoodLies is still wrong. Less than a month ago, it was reported that Stefani and Shelton are unwilling to marry and are so happy with their relationship.  So, both scenarios are wrong: They're not planning a big wedding or talking about Eloping. Stefani's representative already said Gossip Cop earlier this week that the wedding (and pregnancy) allegations were ""untrue"" and now the spokesman confirmed to us that this new story is fake and fake. On the basis of all the evidence sketched here by Gossip Cop that should be very clear.",0
"45th President of the United States  Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current President of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.  Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens, and received an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He took charge of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it to The Trump Organization, and expanded it into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer products. He managed the company until his 2017 inauguration. He co-authored several books, including The Art of the Deal. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he produced and hosted the reality television show The Apprentice from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $3.1 billion.  Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump was elected president in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election while losing the popular vote. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Many of his comments and actions have been perceived as racially charged.  During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after several legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He signed tax cut legislation which also rescinded the individual insurance mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act and opened the Arctic Refuge for oil drilling. He enacted a partial repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He pursued his America First agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and imposed import tariffs on various goods, triggering a trade war with China.  After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate ""any links and/or coordination"" between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in its election interference. Trump has repeatedly denied accusations of collusion and obstruction of justice, calling the investigation a politically motivated ""witch hunt"".  Family and personal life  Ancestry and parents  Trump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt in the Palatinate on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland on his mother's side. All of his grandparents and his mother were born in Europe.  Trump's paternal grandfather, Frederick Trump, first immigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16 and became a citizen in 1892.[2] He amassed a fortune operating boomtown restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during its gold rush.[2] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple permanently settled in New York in 1905. Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.  Trump as a child  Trump's father Fred was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, ""E. Trump & Son"",[nb 2] founded in 1923,[9] was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments.[10] In 1971, Donald Trump was made president of the company, which was later renamed the Trump Organization.  In spite of his German ancestry, ""Fred Trump sought to pass himself off as Swedish amid anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II.""[12] Donald propagated this myth in The Art of the Deal.[12][13][14]  Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she immigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[15] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[15][16]  Early life and education  Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City, the fourth of five children.[19] Trump grew up in Jamaica, Queens, and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[21]  In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University.[22] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[22] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump & Son.[24] He graduated in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[22][25][26]  While in college from 1964 to 1968, Trump obtained four student deferments from serving in the military.[27][28] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a medical examination and in July 1968, after graduating from college, was briefly classified as eligible to serve by a local draft board. In October 1968, he was given a medical deferment which he later attributed to spurs in both heels, and classified as 1-Y, ""unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency.""[29] In the December 1969 draft lottery, Trump's birthday, June 14, received a high number which would have given him a low probability to be called to military service even without the 1-Y.[29][30][31] In 1972, he was reclassified as 4-F, disqualifying him for service.[30][32]  Family  Trump grew up with three elder siblings—Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth—as well as a younger brother named Robert. Maryanne is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[33]  Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[34][35] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[36]  In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[37][38] They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[39] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[40]  In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump's daughter, who was named Tiffany in honor of high-end retailer Tiffany & Company.[41] Maples and Trump were married two months later in December 1993.[42] They divorced in 1999,[43] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[44]  In 2005, Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.[45] In 2006, Melania became a United States citizen[46] and gave birth to a son, Barron.[47][48] Melania became First Lady when Trump became president in January 2017.[49]  Upon his inauguration as president, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[50] His daughter Ivanka resigned from the Trump Organization and moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[51] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[52]  Religion  Trump is Presbyterian.[53][54][55] His ancestors were Lutheran on his paternal grandfather's side in Germany and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland.[57] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936. As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where he had his confirmation.[38] In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan.[59] The pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[59] Trump has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life.[59]  Trump says while he's ""not sure"" if he's asked God for forgiveness, he takes Holy Communion as often as possible, believing it to be a form of 'cleansing'.[53] While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, ""Nothing beats the Bible.""[61] The New York Times reported that evangelical Christians nationwide thought ""that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure"".[62]  Trump has associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his ""closest spiritual confidant"".[63] In 2015, he released a list of religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, Michele Bachmann, Robert Jeffress, and others.[64][65]  Health  Trump does not drink alcohol except occasional wine, such as at communion.[66][53] This decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.[67][68] He also said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[69]  In December 2015, Trump's personal physician, Harold Bornstein, released a superlative-laden letter of health praising Trump for ""extraordinary physical strength and stamina"".[70] Bornstein later said that Trump himself had dictated the contents.[71] A followup medical report showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin.[72][73] In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who stated that he was in excellent health, although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended,[66] and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues.[74] Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle and LDL cholesterol ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.[75]  Wealth  Trump is the beneficiary of several trust funds set up by his father and paternal grandmother beginning in 1949.[77] In 1976, Fred Trump set up trust funds of $1 million (equivalent to $4.3 million in 2017) for each of his five children and three grandchildren; Donald Trump received annual payments from his trust fund, for example, $90,000 in 1980 and $214,605 in 1981.[77] By 1993, when Trump took two loans totaling $30 million from his siblings, their anticipated shares of Fred's fortune were $35 million each.[78][77] Upon Fred Trump's death in 1999, his will divided $20 million after taxes (equivalent to $29.38 million in 2017) among his surviving children.[77][79][80]  Trump said that he began his career with ""a small loan of one million dollars"" from his father.[81] He appeared on the initial Forbes 400 list of richest Americans in 1982 with an estimated $200 million fortune shared with his father.[82] Former Forbes reporter Jonathan Greenberg stated in 2018 that during the 1980s Trump had deceived him about his actual net worth and his share of the family assets in order to appear on the list.[83][84] Trump made the Forbes World's Billionaires list for the first time in 1989,[85] but he was dropped from the Forbes 400 from 1990 to 1995 following business losses.[82] In 2005, Deutsche Bank loan documents pegged Trump's net worth at $788 million, while Forbes quoted $2.6 billion and journalist Tim O'Brien gave a range of $150 million to $250 million.[85] In its 2018 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.1 billion[nb 1] (766th in the world, 248th in the U.S.)[88] making him one of the richest politicians in American history.  When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion;[89] however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth ""over $50 million"", yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt over $265 million.[90] Trump reported a yearly income of $362 million for 2014[89] and $611 million from January 2015 to May 2016.[91]  A 2016 analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist concluded that his performance since 1985 had been ""mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York"".[92] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that ""Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success"".[93]  Business career  Real estate  In 1968, Trump began his career at his father Fred's real estate development company, E. Trump & Son, which, among other interests, owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[95] Trump worked for his father to revitalize the Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, which the elder Trump had bought in 1964.[96][97] The management of the property was sued for racial discrimination in 1969; the suit ""was quietly settled at Fred Trump's direction.""[97] The Trumps sold the property in 1972, with vacancy on the rise.[97]  When his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[98] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended in a lawsuit that their company systematically discriminated against African Americans who wished to rent apartments. The Department alleged that the Trump Organization had screened out people based on race and not low income as the Trumps had stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[99][100] Trump's attorney at the time was Roy Cohn, who valued both positive and negative publicity, and responded to attacks with forceful counterattacks; Trump later emulated Cohn's style.  Manhattan developments  In 1978, Trump launched his Manhattan real estate business by purchasing a 50 percent stake in the derelict Commodore Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal. The purchase was funded largely by a $70 million construction loan that was guaranteed jointly by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain.[77] When the remodeling was finished, the hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel.  The same year, Trump obtained the rights to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 664-foot-high (202 m) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[104][105] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation. The building was completed in 1983 and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[107][108] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower's atrium was ""the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years"".[110]  In 1980, repairs began on Central Park's Wollman Rink, with an anticipated two-and-a-half year construction time frame. Because of flaws in the design and numerous problems during construction, the project remained unfinished by May 1986 and was estimated to require another 18 months and $2 million to $3 million to complete.[111][112] Trump was awarded a contract as the general contractor in June 1986 to finish the repairs by December 15 with a cost ceiling of $3 million, with the actual costs to be reimbursed by the city.[112] Trump hired an architect, a construction company, and a Canadian ice-rink manufacturer and completed the work in four months, $775,000 under budget.[112] He operated the rink for a year and gave some of the profits to charity and public works projects[113] in exchange for the rink's concession rights.[114][112] Trump managed the rink from 1987 to 1995. He received another contract in 2001 which was extended until 2021.[115][116] According to journalist Joyce Purnick, Trump's ""Wollman success was also the stuff of a carefully crafted, self-promotional legend.""[115] While the work was in progress, Trump called numerous press conferences, for example for the completion of the laying of the pipes and the pouring of the cement.[117] In 1987, he also unsuccessfully tried to get the city to rename the landmark after him; the Trump logo is prominently displayed on the railing encircling the rink, on the Zamboni,[115] on the rental skates,[116] and on the rink's website.[116][118]  In 1988 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million and appointed his wife Ivana to manage its operation. Trump invested $50 million to restore the building, which he called ""the Mona Lisa"". According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking. They sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved in the hotel's day-to-day operations.[121]  In 1994, Trump's company refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle with design and structural enhancements turning it into a 44-story luxury residential and hotel property[122][123] known as Trump International Hotel and Tower.  In 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street. In 1997, he began construction on Riverside South, which he dubbed Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[126] From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50 percent share of the Empire State Building. He intended to rename it ""Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments"" if he had been able to boost his share.[127] In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower.[129] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.  Palm Beach estate  Mar-a-Lago in 2009  In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for $10 million, $7 million for the real estate and $3 million for the furnishings.[131][132] His initial offer of $28 million had been rejected, and he was able to obtain the property for the lower price after a real-estate market ""slump"".[133] The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post.[134] After her death, her heirs unsuccessfully tried to donate the property to the government before putting it up for sale.[134][135] In addition to using a wing of the estate as a home, Trump turned Mar-a-Lago into a private club. In order to join, prospective members had to pay an initiation fee[136] and annual dues. The initiation fee was $100,000 until 2016; it was doubled to $200,000 in January 2017.[138][139]  Atlantic City casinos  After New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, Trump went to Atlantic City to explore new business opportunities. Seven years later, he opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino; the project was built by Trump with financing from the Holiday Corporation who also managed its operation. It was renamed ""Trump Plaza"" soon after it opened. The casino's poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump's paying $70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[142][143] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife Ivana managed that property until 1988.  Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal, in 1988 while it was under construction, through a complex transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International.[146] It was completed at a cost of $1.1 billion and opened in April 1990.[147][148] The project was financed with $675 million in junk bonds[149] and was a major gamble by Trump. The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[151] leaving Trump with 50 percent ownership.[152] Facing ""enormous debt"", he sold his airline, Trump Shuttle, and his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[153][154]  In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[156] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[157] Trump remained chairman of THCR until 2009.[158]  Golf courses  As of December 2016 , the Trump Organization owns or operates 18 golf course and golf resorts in the United States and abroad.[159] According to his FEC personal financial disclosure, his 2015 golf and resort revenue amounted to $382 million,[160][91] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[161]  Trump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999; his first property was the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida.[162] By 2007, Trump owned 4 courses around the US.[162] Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Trump began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.[163] Trump's use of these courses during his presidency was controversial. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor Barack Obama for his numerous golf outings, Trump golfed 11 times during his first eight weeks in office.[164] According to CNN, Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 91 times in 2017, although the White House does not disclose whether or not the president actually played on each of those visits.[165]  Branding and licensing  The Trump Organization expanded its business into branding and management by licensing the Trump name for a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint beyond New York with the branding and management of various developers' hotel towers around the world. These included projects in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai, and Indonesia.[166]  The Trump name has also been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings. These ventures met with mixed success for Trump, his partners, and investors in the projects.[citation needed] In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[167] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59 million in yearly revenue for his companies.[168]  Lawsuits and bankruptcies  As of April 2018 , Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today.[169] As of 2016 , he or one of his companies had been the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[170][171]  Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[172][173] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, ""I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me"" as a tool for trimming debt.[174][175] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[176][177]  Side ventures  After Trump took over the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he expanded its real estate operations and ventured into other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[178]  Sports  In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals—an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL). After the 1985 season, the league folded largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule where they competed with the NFL for audience, and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the organization.[179][180]  Trump operated golf courses in several countries.[179] He hosted several boxing matches at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, including Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[181] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[182] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[183]  Miss Universe  From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[184][185] The pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. His management of this business involved his family members—daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[187][188] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[189]  Following Trump's controversial statements about illegal Mexican immigrants during his 2015 presidential campaign kickoff speech, NBC ended its business relationship with him, stating that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[190] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[191]  Trump University  Trump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[192][193][194] In 2005, New York State authorities notified the operation that its use of the word ""university"" was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the ""Trump Entrepreneurial Institute"".[195] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[196]  Ronald Schneckenberg, a sales manager for Trump University, said in a testimony that he was reprimanded for not trying harder to sell a $35,000 real estate class to a couple who could not afford it.[197] Schneckenberg said that he believed ""Trump University was a fraudulent scheme"" which ""preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money.""[197]  In 2013, New York State filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University; the suit alleged that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[195][198] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[199] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized presiding Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[200][201] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25 million and denied any wrongdoing.[202][203]  Foundation  The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[204] that was established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[205][206] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[207] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[207]  The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[208] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[209][210] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[207] Trump later named Linda McMahon as Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[211]  In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[212] Also in 2016, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities, ordering it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[213][214][215] A Trump spokesman called the Attorney General's investigation a ""partisan hit job"".[213] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove ""even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.""[216] According to an IRS filing in November 2017, the foundation intended to shut down and distribute its assets (about $970,000) to other charities. However, the New York Attorney General's office had to complete their ongoing investigation before the foundation could legally shut down,[217] and in June 2018 they filed a civil suit against the foundation for $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[218] The suit names Trump himself as well as his adult children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka.[219]  Conflicts of interest  Before being inaugurated as president, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his eldest sons and a business associate.[220][221] According to ethics experts, as long as Trump continues to profit from his businesses, the measures taken by Trump do not help to avoid conflicts of interest.[222] Because Trump would have knowledge of how his administration's policies would affect his businesses, ethics experts recommend that Trump sell off his businesses.[221] Multiple lawsuits have been filed alleging that Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the United States Constitution due to his business interests; they argue that these interests allow foreign governments to influence him.[222][223] Previous presidents in the modern era have either divested their holdings or put them in blind trusts,[220] and he is the first president to be sued over the emoluments clause.[223]  Media career  Books  Trump has published numerous books. His first published book in 1987 was Trump: The Art of the Deal, in which Trump is credited as co-author with Tony Schwartz, who has stated that he did all the writing for the book.[224][225][226] It reached number 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, stayed there for 13 weeks, and altogether held a position on the list for 48 weeks.[225] According to The New Yorker, ""The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon.""[225] Trump's published writings shifted post-2000 from stylized memoirs to financial tips and political opinion.[227]  Film and television  Wrestling  In 1988 and 1989, Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall, and he has been an active participant in several World Wrestling shows.[228] In 2013, he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion.[229]  The Apprentice  In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a one-year management job with the Trump Organization; applicants were successively eliminated from the game with the catchphrase ""You're fired"".[230][224][231] He went on to be co-host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities.[230][231][232]  In February 2015, Trump stated that he was ""not ready"" to sign on for another season of the show because of the possibility of a presidential run.[233] Despite this, NBC announced they were going ahead with production of a 15th season.[234] In June, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, ""Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.""[235]  In 2011, Trump was given a weekly unpaid guest commentator spot on Fox & Friends that continued for years.[236][237][238]  Acting  Trump has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series,[239] including a cameo as one of the characters' father in The Little Rascals.[240][241] He performed a song with Megan Mullally at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005.[242][243]  Trump receives a pension as a member of the Screen Actors Guild.[244] His financial disclosure forms mentioned an annual pension of $110,000 in 2016 and $85,000 in 2017.[244][245][246]  Public profile  Approval ratings  Presidential approval polls taken during the first ten months of Trump's term have shown him to be the least popular U.S. president in the history of modern opinion polls.[247][248][249] A Pew Research Center global poll conducted in July 2017, found ""a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs"". This compares to a median of 64 percent rate of confidence for his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump received a higher rating in only two countries: Russia and Israel.[250] An August 2017 POLITICO/Morning consult poll found on some measures ""that majorities of voters have low opinions of his character and competence"".[251] Trump is the only elected president who did not place first on Gallup's poll of men Americans most admired in his first year in office, coming in second behind Barack Obama.[252][253]  False statements  As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[254][255][256][257]  Trump uttered ""at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days"" in office according to The New York Times,[254] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the ""Fact Checker"" political analysis column of The Washington Post,[258] which also wrote, ""President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered ... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.""[255] After 558 days in office, the tally was at 4,229 false or misleading claims, and it had risen to an average of 7.6 per day from 4.9 during Trump's first 100 days in office.[259] According to one study, the rate of false statements has increased, with the percentage of his words that are part of a false claim rising over the course of his presidency.[257] In general, news organizations have been hesitant to label these statements as ""lies"".[260][261][257]  Racial views  Trump has a history of making racially controversial remarks and taking actions that are perceived as racially motivated.[262] In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[95][263][264] He was accused of racism for insisting that a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger attack, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. He continued to maintain this position as late as 2016.[265]  Starting in 2011, Trump was a major proponent of ""birther"" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and questioned his eligibility to serve as president.[266][267] Trump later took credit for pushing the White House to release the ""long-form"" birth certificate from Hawaii,[268][269][270] and he stated during his presidential campaign that his stance had made him ""very popular"".[271] In September 2016, he publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States,[272] and falsely claimed that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 campaign.[273]  Trump makes a statement (begins at 07:20 into the video) on the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville published by the White House  Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech in which he stated: ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ... They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.""[274][275][276][277] Later, his attacks on a Mexican-American judge were criticized as racist.[278] His comments following a 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, were seen as implying a moral equivalence between white supremacist marchers and those who protested them.[279] In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation with Congressional leaders, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African countries as ""shitholes"".[280] His remarks were condemned as racist worldwide, as well as by many members of Congress.[281][282][283] Trump has denied accusations of racism multiple times, saying he is the ""least racist person"".[284][285]  Trump's racially insensitive statements[263] have been condemned by many observers in the U.S. and around the world,[286][287] but accepted by his supporters either as a rejection of political correctness[288][289] or because they harbor similar racial sentiments.[290][291] Several studies and surveys have stated that racist attitudes and racial resentment have fueled Trump's political ascendance, and have become more significant than economic factors in determining party allegiance of voters.[291][292] According to an October 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll, 45 percent of American voters viewed Trump as racist and 40 percent did not.[293] In a June 2018 Quinnipiac University poll, 49 percent of respondents believed that Trump is racist while 47 percent believed he is not. Additionally, 55 percent said he ""has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly.""[294][295]  Relationship with the press  President Trump talking to the press, March 2017  Throughout his career, Trump has sought media attention. His interactions with the press turned into what some sources called a ""love-hate"" relationship.[296][297][298] According to biographer Michael D'Antonio, Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s.[299]  During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased, although he[300][301] benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[302] According to journalist Lesley Stahl, after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he had told her that he kept attacking the media to ""demean"" and ""discredit"", ""so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you"".[303] Into his presidency, much of the press coverage of Trump and his administration was negative.[304][305]  Trump has often referred to the press as ""fake news media"" and ""the enemy of the people"".[306] He has privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials (despite, during his campaign, promising not to do so once he became president).[307] On his first day in office, Trump falsely accused journalists of understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration, and called the media ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth"".  The relationship between Trump, the media, and fake news has been studied. One study found that between October 7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a fake news website, ""Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmingly pro-Trump"" and ""almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10 percent of people with the most conservative online information diets"".[308][309] Brendan Nyhan, one of the authors of the study by researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College, and the University of Exeter, stated in an interview on NBC News: ""People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites"".[310]  Popular culture  Trump has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode ""Bart to the Future"", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018.[311]  Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio. Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[314][315] Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip hop lyrics since the 1980s, as he was named in hundreds of songs, most often in a positive tone.[316][317] Mentions of Trump turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.[316][318][319]  Social media  Trump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in March 2009. He communicated heavily on Twitter during the 2016 election campaign, and has continued to use this channel during his presidency. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as president. He uses Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press.[320] Many of the assertions he tweeted have been proven false.[321][322][323]  Recognitions  In December 2016, Time named Trump as its ""Person of the Year"".[324] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the ""President of the Divided States of America.""[325][326] In the same month, he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[327] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[328] In 2015, Robert Gordon University revoked the honorary Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) it had granted Trump in 2010, stating that ""Mr. Trump has made a number of statements that are wholly incompatible with the ethos and values of the university.""[329]  Political career  Political activities up to 2015  Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. He was a Democrat prior to 1987, when he registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[330] He switched to Independent in 1999, Democrat in 2001, and back to Republican in 2009.[330]  In 1987 Trump spent almost $100,000 (equivalent to $215,407 in 2017) to place full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, proclaiming that ""America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves"".[331] The advertisements also advocated for ""reducing the budget deficit, working for peace in Central America, and speeding up nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union.""[332] After rumors of a presidential run, Trump was invited by Democratic senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Arkansas congressman Beryl Anthony Jr., to host a fundraising dinner for Democratic Congressional candidates and to switch parties. Anthony told The New York Times that ""the message Trump has been preaching is a Democratic message"". Asked whether the rumors were true, Trump denied being a candidate, but said, ""I believe that if I did run for President, I'd win.""[332] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired man in America, behind Ted Kennedy and Bill Cosby.  2000 presidential campaign  In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the nomination of the Reform Party for the 2000 presidential election.[335][336] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[337] Trump eventually dropped out of the race, but still went on to win the Reform Party primaries in California and Michigan.[338][339] After his run, Trump left the party due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[335] Trump also considered running for president in 2004.[340] In 2005, Trump said that he voted for George W. Bush.[341] In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president.[342]  2012 presidential speculation  Trump publicly speculated about running for president in the 2012 election, and made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. The speech is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[343] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election.[344] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[345]  Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[346] Trump's moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[344][347][348] Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump ""accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world"" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011.[349]  2013–2015  In 2013, Trump was a featured CPAC speaker.[350] In a sparsely-attended speech, he railed against illegal immigration while seeming to encourage immigration from Europe, bemoaned Obama's ""unprecedented media protection"", advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and suggested that the government ""take"" Iraq's oil and use the proceeds to pay a million dollars each to families of dead soldiers.[351][352] He spent over $1 million that year to research a possible 2016 candidacy.[353]  In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump responded that while New York had problems and its taxes were too high, he was not interested in the governorship.[354] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[355] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[356]  2016 Republican presidential primaries  On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump discussed illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan: ""Make America Great Again"".[275][274] Trump said his wealth would make him immune to pressure from campaign donors.[357] He declared that he was funding his own campaign,[358] but according to The Atlantic, ""Trump's claims of self-funding have always been dubious at best and actively misleading at worst.""[359]  In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Trump entered a field of 17 major candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[360] Trump's campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[361]  On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[362] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016—which prompted the remaining candidates Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns—RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[363]  2016 general election campaign  After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016.  Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[364][365][366]  On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[367] Four days later on July 19, Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[368] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[369][370]  Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech. The historically long speech received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[371][372][373]  On September 26, 2016, Trump and Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, and moderated by NBC News anchor Lester Holt.[374] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[375] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning of that debate was dominated by references to a recently leaked tape of Trump making sexually explicit comments, which Trump countered by referring to alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Bill Clinton. Prior to the debate, Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.[376][377]  Political positions  Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[378] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.  His political positions have been described as populist,[379][380][381] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[382] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[383] usually considered a Democratic Party policy.[384][385] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a ""fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views"", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[386]  Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[388][389][390] Politico has described his positions as ""eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory"",[390] while NBC News counted ""141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues"" during his campaign.[391]  Campaign rhetoric  In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[300][392][301] In part due to his fame, and due to his willingness to say things other candidates would not, and because a candidate who is gaining ground automatically provides a compelling news story, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[302]  Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[393][394][395] At least four major publications—Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times—have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements, with the Los Angeles Times saying that ""Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has"".[396] NPR said that Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[397]  Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[398] Trump has called his public speaking style ""truthful hyperbole"", an effective political tactic that may, however, backfire for overpromising.[398]  White supremacist support  Acts of populism that proved successful for Trump included recognition of some Americans who felt ""anger"" towards cultural changes, sexual liberty and the potential of white Americans–especially white Protestants–becoming a minority group in the United States.[379] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[399]  During his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists.[400][401][402] He retweeted open racists,[403][404] and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, saying that he would first need to ""do research"" because he knew nothing about Duke or white supremacists.[405][406] Trump has said that he disavowed David Duke and the KKK on multiple occasions.[407][408][409] Duke himself was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump throughout the 2016 primary and election, and has stated that he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to ""take our country back"".[410] In a tweet he reminded Trump that ""it was White Americans who put you in the presidency"".[411]  The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[412] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[413][414][415] Members of the alt-right enthusiastically supported Trump's campaign.[416] In August 2016, he appointed Steve Bannon—the executive chairman of Breitbart News—as his campaign CEO; Bannon described Breitbart News as ""the platform for the alt-right.""[417] Trump personally condemned the alt-right in an interview after the election.[418]  Financial disclosures  As a presidential candidate, Trump disclosed details of his companies, assets, and revenue sources to the extent required by the FEC. His 2015 report listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $265 million.[90][419] The 2016 form showed little change.[91]  Trump did not release his tax returns during his presidential campaign or afterward,[420][421] contrary to usual practice by every candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 and to his promise in 2014 to do so if he ran for office.[422][423][424] Trump's refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[425] He said that his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[426][427] Trump has told the press that his tax rate was none of their business, and that he tries to pay ""as little tax as possible"".[428][429][430]  In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[431] He said that he did use the tax code to avoid paying taxes.[432][433][434]  On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to Rachel Maddow and shown on MSNBC. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150 million and paid $38 million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of these documents and stated: ""Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.""[435][436]  Sexual misconduct allegations  A total of 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct as of December 2017 .[437] Trump and his campaign have denied as of October 2016 all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called ""false smears"", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[438][439][440]  Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[441][442][443] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. In the tape, Trump said: ""I just start kissing them ... I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab 'em by the pussy.""[444] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he ""moved on her very heavily"".[444]  Trump's language on the tape was described by the media as ""vulgar"", ""sexist"", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[445][446] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[447][448] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[449] Subsequently, at least 15 women[450] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[451][452] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump alleged that former president Bill Clinton had ""abused women"" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.[453]  Election to the presidency  2016 electoral vote results  On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides.[454] Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[455][nb 3] Clinton was ahead nationwide by 2.1 percentage points, with 65,853,514 votes (7001481800000000000♠48.18%) to 62,984,828 votes (7001460900000000000♠46.09%); neither candidate reached a majority.[458]  Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset by most observers, as polls had consistently showed Hillary Clinton with a nationwide—though diminishing—lead, as well as a favorable advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated throughout his campaign,[459] and many observers blamed errors in polls, partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[460] Actually, the polls were relatively accurate,[461] but media outlets and pundits alike showed overconfidence in a Clinton victory despite a large number of undecided voters and a favorable concentration of Trump's core constituencies in competitive states.[462]  Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been called a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress.  Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history, even after adjusting for inflation.[463] He is also the first president without prior government or military service.[464][465][466] Of the 43[nb 4] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office, two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet, and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[466]  Protests  Women's March in Washington on January 21, 2017, a day after the inauguration  Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice versa both inside and outside the venues.[468][469][470] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States, in opposition to his policies and his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that these were ""professional protesters, incited by the media"", and were ""unfair"", but he later tweeted, ""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.""[471][472]  In the weeks following Trump's inauguration, massive anti-Trump demonstrations took place, such as the Women Marches, which gathered 2,600,000 people worldwide,[473] including 500,000 in Washington alone.[474] Moreover, marches against his travel ban began across the country on January 29, 2017, just 9 days after his inauguration.[475]  Other legal affairs  Adult film actress Stormy Daniels has alleged that she and Trump had an affair in 2006,[476] which Trump denied.[477] Just before the 2016 presidential election Daniels was paid $130,000 by Trump's attorney Michael Cohen as part of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA); Cohen said he paid her with his own money.[478] In February 2018, Daniels sued Cohen's company asking to be released from the NDA and be allowed to tell her story. Cohen obtained a restraining order to keep her from discussing the case.[479][480] In March, Daniels claimed in court that the NDA never came into effect because Trump did not sign it personally.[481] In April, Trump said that he did not know about Cohen paying Daniels, why Cohen had made the payment or where Cohen got the money from.[482] In May, Trump's annual financial disclosure revealed that he reimbursed Cohen in 2017 for payments related to Daniels.[483] In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, admitting to paying hush money of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 indirectly to Playboy model Karen McDougal, and said that he did it at the direction of Trump,[484][485] with the aim of influencing the presidential election.[486] In response, Trump said that he only knew about the payments ""later on"", and that he paid back Cohen personally, not out of campaign funds.[487] Cohen also said he would cooperate fully with the Special Counsel investigation into collusion with Russia.[488]  Presidency  Early actions  Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, re-instatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[489]  On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the Supreme Court previous held by Justice Antonin Scalia until his death in 2016.[490]  Domestic policy  Trade tariffs  Trump has been described as a protectionist[491][492][493] because he criticized NAFTA,[494][495] cancelled negotiations towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[496] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum,[497][498] and proposed to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[499][500] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[501][502]  In March 2018, Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries.[503] In response, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting $3.4 billion in U.S. exports.[504][505] In July, China retaliated with a $34 billion in tariffs on U.S. goods.[506][507] Trump had signaled that he might impose an additional $200 billion in tariffs if China imposed their own tariffs, with the potential for a further $200 billion, in an escalating trade war[508] that analysts say could impact $2 trillion in global trade.[509][510]  Economy  Trump speaking to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017  In December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the estate tax threshold to $11.2 million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.[511] The reduction in individual tax rates ends in 2025. While people would generally get a tax cut, those with higher incomes would see the most benefit.[512][513] Households in the lower or middle class would also see a small tax increase after the tax cuts expire. The bill is estimated to increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.[514][515]  Energy and climate  While campaigning Trump's energy policy advocated domestic support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[516] However following his election his ""America First Energy Plan"" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels.[517] Environmentalists have expressed concerns because he has announced plans to make large budget cuts in programs that research renewable energy and to roll back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change and limiting environmental pollution.[518]  Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change[519][520] and his former Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, does not believe that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming. While admitting that the climate is warming, Pruitt believes that warming is not necessarily harmful and could be beneficial.[521] Based on numerous studies, climate experts disagree with his position.[522] On June 1, 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[523][524][525]  Government size and deregulation  Trump's early policies have favored rollback and dismantling of government regulations. He signed a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution, the first in 16 years and second overall.[526] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[527][528]  On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, except for those working in certain areas.[529][530] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[531] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[531] A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[532][533] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[534]  Health care  In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live: ""I believe in universal healthcare.""[535] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[536] and he has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[535][537][538]  During his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[539][540] Shortly after taking office, he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May of that year, the United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the ACA.[541] Over the course of several months' effort, however, the Senate was unable to pass any version of a repeal bill.[542] Trump has expressed a desire to ""let Obamacare fail"", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[543][544][545] The tax reform Trump signed into law at the end of his first year in office effectively repealed the individual health insurance mandate that was a major element of the Obamacare health insurance system; this repeal is scheduled to be implemented in 2019.[546][547][548]  Social issues  Trump favored changing the 2016 Republican platform to affirm women's right to abortion in the three exceptional cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[549] He has said that he is committed to appointing pro-life justices.[550] He personally supports ""traditional marriage""[551] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a ""settled"" issue.[550]  Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[552][553] although his views have shifted over time.[554] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[555] He favors capital punishment,[556][557] as well as the use of waterboarding and ""a hell of a lot worse"" methods.[558][559]  Immigration  Trump conferring with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly , January 25, 2017  Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[560] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[561] and criticized birthright citizenship for creating ""anchor babies"".[562] He said that deportation would focus on criminals, visa overstays, and security threats.[563]  Travel ban  Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[564][565][566] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a ""proven history of terrorism"".[567][568][569]  On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[570] Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports.[571][572] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[573][574]  On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional;[575] Trump immediately dismissed her.[576][577] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[578][579] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities.[580][570] Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation.[581] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a ""credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.""[582]  The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, and certain Venezuelan officials.[583] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions with injunctions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4.[584] In January 2018, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the travel ban.[585] The Court heard oral arguments on April 25,[586][585] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June ruling.[587]  DACA  While running for president, Trump said that he intended to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) on ""day one"" of his presidency. The program, introduced in 2012, allowed people who had either entered or remained in the United States illegally as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and be eligible for a work permit.[588]  In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would be repealed after six months.[589] Trump argued that ""top legal experts"" believed that DACA was unconstitutional, and called on Congress to use the six-month delay to pass legislation solving the ""Dreamers"" issue permanently.[590] As of March 2018 , when the delay expired, no legislation had been agreed on DACA.[591] Several states immediately challenged the DACA rescission in court.[592] Two injunctions in January and February 2018 allowed renewals of applications and stopped the rolling back of DACA, and in April 2018 a federal judge ordered the acceptance of new applications; this would go into effect in 90 days.[593]  Family separation at border  In April 2018, Trump enacted a ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy that took adults irregularly entering the U.S. into custody for criminal prosecution and forcibly separated children from parents, eliminating the policy of previous administrations that made exceptions for families with children.[594][595] By mid-June, more than 2,300 children had been placed in shelters, including ""tender age"" shelters for babies and toddlers,[596] culminating in demands from Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups that the policy be rescinded.[597] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law.[598][599][600] On June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border.[601] On June 26 a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Trump administration to stop detaining immigrants parents separately from their minor children, and to reunite family groups that had been separated at the border.[602]  Foreign policy  President Trump together with other leaders at the 43rd G7 summit in Italy  Trump has been described as a non-interventionist[603][604] and as an American Nationalist.[605] He has repeatedly stated that he supports his foreign policy ""America First"".[606] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[605] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[607] He says America should look inward, stop ""nation building"", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[604]  In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[608] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[609] a position he later retracted.[610]  Trump has praised China's President Xi Jinping,[611] Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte,[612] Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,[613] Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,[614] King Salman of Saudi Arabia[615] and Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.[616] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[617] On April 13, 2018, he announced missile strikes against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, following a suspected chemical attack near Damascus.[618]  Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Iran-backed Houthis and signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[619][620][621]  In November 2017, the Trump administration tightened the rules on trade with Cuba and individual visits to the county, undoing the Obama administration's loosening of restrictions. According to an administration official, the new rules were intended to hinder trade with businesses with ties to the Cuban military, intelligence and security services.[622]  U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, as of January 2017 .[623] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[624] U.S. officials said then that they aimed to ""force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement""; in January 2018, however, Trump spoke against talks with the Taliban.[625]  Iran  During the campaign Trump maintained that ""Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons.""[626] He opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or ""Iran nuclear deal"") that was negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015, calling it ""terrible"" and saying that the Obama administration negotiated the agreement ""from desperation.""[627] At one point he said that despite opposing the content of the deal, he would attempt to enforce it rather than abrogate it.[628] However, in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in March 2016, Trump said that his ""number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.""[629]  Shortly after taking office, Trump put Iran 'on notice' following their ballistic missile tests on January 29, 2017.[630] In February 2018, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran's 25 individuals and entities, which it said were but ""initial steps"", with Trump's National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn adding that ""the days of turning a blind eye to Iran's hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over.""[631][632][633]  Trump reportedly lobbied ""dozens"" of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, under which the U.S. may not pursue ""any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran."" The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.[634] On May 18, 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the JCPOA.[635]  Israel  Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is ""a big fan of Israel"".[636] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv.[637] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, which included Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[638][639] Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017, despite criticism and warnings from world leaders. Trump added that he would initiate the process of establishing a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem,[640] which was later opened on May 14, 2018.[641] The United Nations General Assembly condemned the move, adopting a resolution that ""calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem"" in an emergency session on December 21, 2017.[642][643]  NATO  As a candidate Trump questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[644] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[645] As president, he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO in March 2017.[646] However, he has repeatedly accused fellow NATO members of paying less than their fair share of the expenses of the alliance.[647]  North Korea  During the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump said he hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[648] However, North Korea accelerated their missile and nuclear tests leading to increased tension.[648] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[649][650] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. would be met with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen.""[651] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country's next missile test toward Guam.[652]  On June 12, 2018, after several rounds of preliminary staff-level meetings, Trump and Kim held a bilateral summit in Singapore.[653] In a joint declaration, both countries vowed to ""join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula"", while North Korea repeated its April 2018 promise to ""work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.""[654][655]  Russia  During his campaign and as president, Trump repeatedly said that he wants better relations with Russia,[656][657] and he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[658][659] Trump had pledged to hold a summit meeting with Putin,[660] stating that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS.[661] According to Putin and some political experts and diplomats, the U.S.–Russian relations, which were already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have further deteriorated since Trump took office in January 2017.[662][663][664]  Trump and Putin met in a 2018 Russia–United States summit in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. Trump drew harsh bipartisan criticism in the United States for appearing to side with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.[665][666] His comments were strongly criticized by many congressional Republicans and most media commentators, even those who normally support him.[667][668]  Personnel  The Trump administration has been characterized by high turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[669] As of early July 2018 , 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[670] and 141 staffers had left in the past year.[671] Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[672] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Mike Flynn (after just 25 days in office), Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, replaced by retired Marine General John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017,[673] and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[672] Close personal aides to Trump such as Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee and Keith Schiller, have quit or been forced out.[674]  Trump has been slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying that many of the positions are unnecessary. As of October 2017 , there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions vacant.[675] At the end of his first year in office, CBS News reported that ""of the roughly 600 key executive branch positions, just 241 have been filled, 135 nominated candidates await confirmation while 244 slots have no nominee at all.""[676][needs update]  Cabinet  Cabinet meeting, March 2017  Trump's cabinet nominations included U.S. Senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[677] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[678] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[679] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[680] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[681] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[682]  While most of Trump's nominees were approved by the GOP majority in the Senate, the confirmation of education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education[683] required Vice President Pence to cast a rare tie-breaking vote, the first in a Cabinet nominee's Senate confirmation.[684]  Two of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy.[685][674] EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July 2018 amidst multiple investigations into his conduct.[686]  Investigations  Russian interference  In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence—jointly stated with ""high confidence"" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[687][688] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that ""the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.""[689] Later, in testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, he affirmed he has ""no doubt"" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding ""they did it with purpose and sophistication"".[690]  Trump's connections to Russia have been widely reported by the press.[691][692] One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency.[693] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[694][695] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[696] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[697] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[698]  Dismissal of James Comey  On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He attributed the action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[699] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[700] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing ""Russia thing""[701] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[702]  According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he ""hoped"" Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn.[703] In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a ""cloud"" impairing his presidency,[704] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[705] He also asked intelligence chiefs Dan Coats and Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[706] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[707] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[704][708] In a statement on Twitter Trump implied that he had ""tapes"" of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[709]  Special counsel  On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former Director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). In this capacity, Mueller oversees the investigation into ""any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation"".[710] Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.[711] Mueller is also investigating the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[712][713]  The Washington Post reported that days after Comey's dismissal the special counsel started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[714] Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[715][716] ABC News later reported that the special counsel was gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but had not launched a full-scale investigation.[717]  In January 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump had ordered Mueller to be fired in June, after learning that Mueller was investigating possible obstruction of justice, but backed down after White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would quit;[718] Trump called the report ""fake news"".[719][720] The New York Times reported in April 2018 that Trump had again wanted the investigation shut down in early December 2017, but stopped after learning the news reports he based his decision on were incorrect.[721] In April 2018, following an FBI raid on the office and home of Trump's private attorney Michael Cohen, Trump mused aloud about firing Mueller.[722]  In January 2018, The Washington Post reported that Mueller wants to interview Trump about the removal of Michael Flynn and James Comey.[723] Trump has expressed a willingness to do the interview; according to The New York Times, some of his lawyers have warned against doing so. Mueller can subpoena Trump to testify if Trump refuses.[724] As of March 2018 , Trump is reportedly a ""subject"" of the investigation, meaning his conduct is being looked at, but not a ""target"" which would indicate the likelihood of criminal charges.[725]  In August 2018, Trump wrote that Attorney General Jeff Sessions ""should stop"" the special counsel investigation ""right now""; he also referred to it as a ""rigged witch hunt"".[726][727][728]  Impeachment efforts  Congressman Al Green delivers a speech calling for impeachment of President Trump, June 2017.  Formal efforts to start the process of impeachment against Trump, who took office in January 2017, have been initiated by Representatives Al Green and Brad Sherman, both Democrats.[729][730] Other people and groups have asserted that Trump has engaged in impeachable activity during his presidency.[731][732] Talk of impeachment began before Trump took office.[733][734]  Serious proposals to impeach Trump for obstruction of justice were made in May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey[735][736][737] and allegations surfaced that Trump had asked Comey to drop the investigation against Michael Flynn.[738] A December 2017 resolution of impeachment failed in the House by a 58–364 margin.[739] Since the Republicans control both the House and the Senate, the likelihood of impeachment during the 2017–2019 115th Congress is considered remote.[740][741]  Independently of impeachment, some commentators have speculated that Trump could be stripped of his powers and duties for incapacity under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.[742][743][744]  2020 presidential campaign  Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[745] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[746] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[747] By January 2018, Trump's reelection committee had $22 million in hand[748] and it had raised a total amount exceeding $50 million towards the 2020 campaign as of July 2018 .[749]  Notes  References",0
"What's going on between Pamela Anderson and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange?  The former ""Baywatch"" actress has frequently been photographed visiting Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he's been living in exile since 2012 in an effort to avoid bail violation charges in the UK and extradition to the US, where he's wanted to leaking classified documents.  At the end of March, the embassy revealed that it had revoked Assange's visitor privileges and access to the internet because he went against ""a written [agreement] not to issue messages that might interfere with other states.""  Reacting to the news, Anderson released a statement to the New York Post expressing her disapproval of the embassy's latest move.

With her visits to Assange suddenly halted, Anderson is once again drumming up speculation around the nature of her relationship with the controversial figure. Though the actress has been dating 32-year-old soccer star Adil Rami since 2017, it's unclear whether or not that romance is exclusive.  ""I don't want to say anything about whether there's a romance,"" Anderson once told Grazia of her relationship with Assange. ""So, let's say we're just 'good friends.'""  Sources close to the WikiLeaks founder say that he has a ""deep crush"" on the actress because ""she's just out of reach.""

Though neither has done much to quell rumors of a romance between them, sources familiar with the ""Baywatch"" actress question her motives in getting involved with Assange and her highly-photographed visits to see him.

Indeed, the outfits that Anderson has worn to visit Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy are always glamorous, often skin-baring and definitely thought-out.

"Science and fashion came together at the LACAMA gala and it never looked more gorgeous. Kim Kardashian risked a massive wardrobe malfunction, but pulled off a shirtless look while on the red carpet!  No shirt? No problem. Kim Kardashian, 37, didn’t need anything underneath her suit coat when she walked the carpet at the Las Angeles County Museum of Art’s Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles on Nov. 4. The Keeping Up with the Kardashian seemed to defy gravity – and dress codes – as she left her shirt in the car. Whoever designed her double-sided tape probably deserves an award, because Kim managed to get through the event without a nip slip or another embarrassing malfunction. Technically, does she have cleavage if she’s not wearing a bra or a shirt?  This year’s event honored Star Wars creator George Lucas and artist Mark Bradford, according to Daily Mail. The event was also presented by Gucci. Kim famously met future hubby Kanye West while dressed as Princess Leia. Plus, she’s also a fashionista and a patron of the arts. That explains why she and her mother, Kris Jenner, were attending this LACMA Fundraiser – and turning heads with Kim’s braless, shirtless fashion choice.  Kim’s bold fashion choices don’t always pay off. While she was posing in one of her sexy Halloween costumes, her nipple made a surprise cameo. While flaunting her Aaliyah-inspired outfit, she seemed to be in need of some double-sided tape, as her jewel-studded bra slipped a bit and – out popped the nip! Considering that Kim spends most of her time half-naked (and proud of it!) this was one of her more minor “malfunctions.” It certainly didn’t stop her from enjoying Halloween!  Speaking of that Aaliyah tribute, Kim actually came under fire for people who accused her of being in “poor taste.” Some fans accused Kim of culture appropriation, since Aaliyah was an African American woman and Kim is not. “The look was inspired by what she wore in her “Try Again” music video,” Kim said when she was explaining her choice (while clapping back at those accusing her costume of being racist.) “I play every kind of genre of music in my home and I like for my kids to be exposed to many different artists. For me, it’s always about love and respect.”  What do you think of Kim’s LACMA gala outfit, HollywoodLifers? Do you think it was stunning? Or do you think it’s a pass?",1

"Kim Kardashian West said she wants to give her daughter “a normal life” as the pair posed in a new photoshoot inspired by the style of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.  The reality TV star said she was “very conscious” of her daughter’s mixed-race heritage after appearing with North, her daughter with rapper Kanye West, in the pictures for Interview Magazine.  The images were taken by photographer Steven Klein. It is the first time four-year-old North has appeared on the cover of a major magazine.  Kardashian, whose family have roots in Armenia, said: “Kanye always has his family around and people who look like my daughter — that’s important to me.  “She’s obsessed with her curly hair, and if she finds someone who has the same hair, she runs to them and is like, ‘You have curly hair like me?’ And we get to talk about it.  “We also talk about it with my niece Penelope, because she and North look really different, but they’re best friends and they’re together all the time.”  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said the family had “strict rules” about how much of the children’s lives are included in the reality show that made their name.  She said: “Some seasons they’re on a little bit, just to show a bit of personality, although there are never storylines about them. But then there’s social media, on which I’ve always been really open. When I’m out and people call North’s name, that’s when it’s weird for me. She lives such a normal life, believe it or not, at home.”  She shared the images on her Instagram page captioning it: “Interview Magazine September cover!!! This photo shoot I will cherish forever as such an amazing memory with my daughter, working with the most incredible team.”  Kardashian-West said the photographs were a “homage to the iconic Jackie Kennedy”.  But she was criticised on social media, with some people saying the pictures were an insult to the memory of the the former First Lady.  One person tweeted: “This is a disgrace, You are no Jackie O,” while another said: “Jackie O turning over in her damn grave right now.”  Some twitter users also wanted to know why Kardashian’s skin colour appeared to have been darkened to match that of her daughter.  “Why did they darken her skin to try and make her look black?” one asked.",1
"Lisa Rinna made her feelings quite clear when she zealously came to her husband Harry Hamlin's defense on Tuesday's episode of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills after Kim Richards accused him of harboring a secret.  And now the 63-year-old Mad Men actor is applauding his wife's actions.  The LA Law star said that he and Lisa equally defend each other's honor.  Scroll down for video  Happy couple: Harry Hamlin stood behind his wife Lisa Rinna after her outburst on Tuesday's Real Housewives of Beverly Hills defending his honor. The pair are pictured at an awards dinner in LA in February  'I was actually proud of her. I mean, look -- you are getting your back up against a wall with something like that,' he told US Weekly at the Raising The Bar to End Parkinson’s event in Sherman Oaks, California on Saturday.  'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, ""You go girl!'""  Even though he previously had his reservations about his wife coming on the show, Harry now admits Lisa is doing a good job.  Make-believe: TMZ has reported that Kim Richards invented the fact that she knows a secret about Harry that Lisa is covering up during last week's episode  'Well, you know, I am [proud] because she’s doing a magnificent job,' he said. 'I think she’s bringing some class to a show that is kind of a reflection of who we are today.  'So in some sense it is art in that respect. I think she’s doing an extraordinary job.'  As for the big secret Kim is accusing him of hiding? Harry said he is in the dark just like everyone else.  Losing her cool: When Kim, 50, brought up her husband, Lisa, 51, furiously smashed a glass of wine  'There is a hashtag #WhatDidHarryDo? out there so maybe someone will tell me at some point, and I hope it was good,' he joked.  On last week's episode, Kim, 50, accused Lisa of harboring a secret about her husband, causing Lisa, 51, to throw and smash a glass full of wine.  Fans were left wondering exactly what Kim 'knew' about Harry, 63, but TMZ reports that Kim fabricated the story just to push Lisa’s buttons.  In the face: Lisa tossed a glass full of wine into Kim's face  According to production sources, the Housewives brought up the issue again during the taping of the reunion episode, and Kim admitted she made it up.  The season five reunion episode was filmed on February 20 and will air on a later date.  Fans witnessed the feud between Kim and Lisa come to a dramatic head on Tuesday night's episode.  In a final flourish after a menacing exchange of words, Lisa furiously smashed a wine glass after throwing the contents in Kim's face.  'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later.  The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam.  Drama: The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam  But the civility did not last long as they started having a serious chat, with Lisa discussing her 'really deep-rooted issues about people dying from alcohol and drug overdoses' after losing her 21-year-old sister when she was just six.  Breaking down, Lisa turned to Kim and said: 'I'm sorry if I've ever gotten into any of your business, I never meant to …'  'Well, you have,' Kim snapped, shocking everyone by cutting her short in her emotional moment and bringing up their feud on the jet over there.  About to explode: Lisa became outraged after Kim brought up her husband Harry  'I have been sober for three years,' Kim insisted, adding that her one time taking a pill at the poker party was a one off.  'You have gone around to everybody and talked about me,' she said, also pointing to Eileen and saying: 'And you too.  She then unexpectedly turned the tables on Lisa, telling her: 'I'm concerned about you, and your situation at home. You wanna bring out my stuff, let's talk about your home life.'  Dinner fight: Kim's sister Kyle Richards looked downcast as the fight dragged on  As Eileen angrily intervened - telling her 'shame on you' - Kim snapped: 'Shut your f***ing mouth, I've had enough of you you beast.'  As Yolanda tried to calm everyone down, she mentioned about how Lisa was understanding because she has admitted that her husband Harry has only been sober for three years.  'Let's talk about the husband,' Kim said spitefully. 'Let's not talk about what you don't want out.'  Too much drama: Kyle, 46, became upset after watching sister Kim's outburst and its aftermath  That was when Lisa exploded, initially trying to grab Kim's face as she snapped: 'Let me tell you something - don't touch my husband, ever.'  'If you don't want it out for everybody to know, you better watch what you talk about me, or everybody will know,' Kim replied. 'Everybody will know.'  Lisa then stood up, threw the contents of her glass at Kim and then angrily smashed it on the table's edge, screaming as Yolanda held her back: 'You never go near my husband! Don't you f***ing understand that? You never go after my f***ing husband!'  Reflecting on her behaviour: 'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later  Later, she asked: 'What the f*** does Kim Richards know - what does she know about Harry? What did he do? She doesn't even know my husband.'  Kim's hatred did not extend just to Lisa and Eileen, 55, - she also attacked her sister Kyle, snidely saying 'go after your new friend' as Kyle, 46, prepared to leave in tears.  'You want me to defend you but your behavior is indefensible!' she sobbed.  Making up: Kim surprised Lisa the next morning by coming to her room to talk things over  Eventually all the women were left huddled together in tears after the ugly fight - with only Brandi Glanville staying with Kim.  Yolanda then went back to them and told Kim: 'That is not the way to communicate. That is not the way to talk. You shouldn't go after her husband or her children.'  'I have been pushed to the limit with this,' Kim insisted.  Street fight: Brandi, 42, later lost her temper while the crew was walking in the street  The other women were most sympathetic to Kyle, with Lisa telling her: 'It's abusive, and if you are in an abusive relationship you walk away from it. You are being abused by Kim.'  Later, Kim explained: 'Alcohol ruled my life. It called all the shots. And it took a heck of a fight to get it back. I'm not gonna let one person go around putting doubt in people's minds.'  'It's so cruel,' Eileen said with tears. 'It's so bizarre to me.'  Stepping out for charity: The 63-year-old star and his daughter Amelia Hamlin attended the Raising The Bar To End Parkinsons Event held at the Public School 818 in Sherman Oaks, California on Saturday  As the evening ended, Lisa vowed that she will 'never talk' to Kim again. But the next morning, Kim caught her by surprise by coming to her hotel door - and was invited in.  'This is the most important thing in my life, my sobriety,' Kim told her. 'And it's where my children get hurt. I will f***ing kill for my kids.'  'Well that was never my intention,' Lisa insisted. 'I have come at this only with good intentions.'  No memory: Yolanda Foster was reminded by a former flame that they used to date  Amazingly given how the previous evening had ended, Lisa assured Kim that they were 'good'. 'I believe so - I believe we can move forward,' she said.  Eileen admitted she found Lisa's sudden about face 'pretty mind blowing'. 'For all of a sudden everything to be OK, like nothing happened - my brain does not compute,' she said.  But the fighting was far from over.  During a night out at a coffee shop, Brandi, 42, said the last time she smoked weed she had been with Kyle, who was upset at her saying it publicly because she did not want her kids to know.  In her defense: Harry told US Weekly, 'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, ""You go girl!'""  As they left, Brandi had a meltdown in the street, saying: 'Anyone and everyone can say whatever the f**k they wanna say about me, but I can't say the truth about them, and it's f***ing annoying.  'You guys re the biggest f***ing hypocrites of all f***ing time!' she exploded, walking off screaming out loud.  'Finally we're having a little reprieve from the drama and insanity. But no, here again, walking down the street screaming bloody murder,' Eileen complained later.  But there were lighter moments. When Yolanda took everyone to meet her mother Ans she cracked them all up by saying she had had a 'space cake' at one of the coffee shops, despite Yolanda telling everyone they 'never did it'.  And during a bike-riding trip, they came across a bearded guy at a windmill who insisted he knew Yolanda 'from back then', adding: 'We dated.'  'I am going to blame it on the brain damage because I swear to God I do not remember the guy,' Yolanda, 51, said later.  'And it makes me feel awful! I should remember who I kissed.'  'She was clearly riding a lot of things, it wasn't just bikes,' Lisa Vanderpump quipped.  They also discussed the red light district, with Yolanda admitting: 'If I was dead broke and I had to feed my children, I would do anything - even that.'  Lisa laughed off the excuse, saying it wasn't necessary to resort to the sex trade to feed your children.",0

"Update, 12:45 p.m.: Royal reporter Rebecca English clarified that the empty chair at the wedding wasn't a tribute to Princess Diana. Instead, it's protocol to leave the seat in front of the Queen empty.  Btw - I’ve seen some reports about the spare seat by Prince William in the chapel as having being left in memory of Princess Diana. It wasn’t empty for that reason. The seat in front of the Queen is always left empty, I am told by BP #royalwedding — Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) May 19, 2018  But even with the vacant chair aside, there were plenty of tributes to Princess Diana at the nuptials, including Meghan Markle's veil, her bridal bouquet, the floral arrangements, and the reading from Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister.  Original post, 11:38 a.m.: About 600 guests filled St. George's Chapel for the royal wedding today, but one seat was apparently left vacant—and it's believed to be for Princess Diana. While following along with the nuptials, viewers noticed there was an empty seat next to Prince William on the royal family's side of the congregation. The supposed explanation? It was reserved for Prince Harry's late mother.    Getty Images  Royal fans got emotional over the tribute.  There’ll be a lot of things said & written about Harry & Meghan’s wedding (and rightly so) but one of the stand outs - for me - was the empty seat right next to William ... for Princess Diana 😢💖 #RoyalWedding #HarryAndMegan #PrincessDiana pic.twitter.com/BuWbWRr9Rx — Jason Reeves (@JaseReeves) May 19, 2018  As if we weren't fragile enough already, the empty seat next to Wills and all of the flowers were for Diana. #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/X1gesINDMK — Cashé Kidd (@CasheKidd) May 19, 2018  is the seat next to william empty because it’s meant for diana? #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/JmsoI0vpfC — Snober Abbasi (@snobers) May 19, 2018  Someone else spotted an empty chair near William. An empty seat for Princess Diana? #RoyalWedding — Lauren Jones White (@LaurenJo8) May 19, 2018  Aside from the empty chair, the royal nuptials was laden with special nods to the late princess, who passed away in 1997. All three of her siblings were present at today's ceremony, and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave a reading.  The white roses in the floral arrangements were also included in honor of Harry's mom. He reportedly hand-picked Meghan's bouquet of forget-me-nots, his mother's favorite flower. Markle gave a sweet shoutout with her veil, which was reminiscent of Diana's insanely long ""monarch-length"" headpiece for her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles in 1981.  To top it off, Sir Elton John, a longtime friend of Diana, performed at the lunchtime reception  There was also apparently an empty chair left at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in Westminster Abbey seven years ago. Viewers at the time also speculated on Twitter that it was a nod to the groom's late mother.  Who's sitting in that empty chair to Camilla's left? Is that for Diana or something? #RoyalWedding — David Kae (@DavidAtlanta) April 29, 2011  A moving tribute of an empty chair for the late Princess Diana. Gone but never forgotten. #royalwedding — Donnie Dhillon (@DonnieDhillon) April 29, 2011  Prince William and Kate Middleton paid tribute to Diana in various ways on their wedding day in 2011. First and foremost, the Duke gave his bride his mother's engagement ring. They also visited her grave before their wedding day. The address was given by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, who knew Diana and spoke at her 10th anniversary memorial, Reuters reports. Finally, the hymn ""Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer,"" which was sung at the late princess' funeral, was also included in her son's royal wedding.",1
"Keira Knightley  ""I had really bad skin until I was 24 and up until then I did everything under the sun to it. Then one day I thought I would try to leave it and that's what suited it better. That's also why I always want to wear as little make-up as possible when I am not working. When I'm filming, I always have a breakout as we have to cake the make-up on. I think it needs a break every now and again to be able to breathe. Since having a baby and being over 30, it's also getting dry for the first time.

"This Is Us season two poster is teasing some happy and sad moments.  Actress Mandy Moore shared the poster on Twitter writing, “Buckle up. Season 2. September 26th.” If our estimations are good, the upcoming season is about to bring lots of tears, but also some laughs.  Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Jack, recently told E! News: “I always tell people to focus more on the way the man lived than how he died. I think—look, go back and watch the episodes. Don’t just watch them for Jack, watch them for every character and understand, let’s say what the adversity is and the challengers are and how they’re met with bravery.  To be really honest I feel zero pressure on season two. I think we, on the creative end, are approaching it the same way,” he told us. “We’re just excited to be there.

"JENNIFER Aniston and Justin Theroux's split was a long time coming with ""rows with their neighbours"" one of the main reasons for their break up.  According to new reports, the couple also argued about where to live, while a bizarre ""bologna incident"" only added to the tension.  Rex Features 5 Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, pictured last April, announced their divorce yesterday with 'differences over where to live' one of the main reasons  The couple yesterday announced they were ""lovingly"" divorcing after just two years of marriage.  A source told Entertainment Tonight that Justin prefers living in New York and ""that's been a major issue for the couple for a long time"".  Although Jen was initially happy to make a go of things in the city and moved into an apartment in the West Village with Justin, 46, she found herself constantly being snapped by paparazzi.  The paps would often set up shop in a small park opposite the apartment to photograph the actress, 49, coming and going, which upset the neighbours.  Rex Features 5 Justin lived a more care-free life in New York city than Jen, who was often snapped by paparazzi  Rex Features 5 Jennifer, pictured in New York back in 2016, was never happy in the city  The source recalled: ""There was the construction, which is obviously a nuisance, but what really p***ed off the neighbours was just the constant commotion outside their door all the time with the photographers.  ""It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbours weren't happy.  ""Justin can hop on his bike, walk in the neighbourhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her.""  At one point, Justin found his beloved motorbike covered with bologna sausage slices, which is said to have infuriated the Friends star who was convinced the neighbours did it.  Architectural Digest 5 Jennifer, posing at her Bel Air apartment for the cover of Architectural Digest, was much happier on the West Coast  The source said: ""She just never really could get settled in, she wasn't happy [in New York].""  The couple ended up selling the West Village apartment, but Justin tellingly kept his Greenwich Village pad.  Although he would stay there when they were on the East Coast, Jen would opt to stay in a luxury hotel.  Eventually, Justin agreed to move to Los Angeles.  But his friendship circle was still in New York and he ""constantly came up with reasons to return"", according to the website.  Although the couple ""really wanted"" to make things work, they couldn't keep the marriage going and they split at the end of last year.  Rex Features 5 Justin, pictured in Los Angeles, kept finding excuses to return to the East Coast, according to Entertainment Tonight  Justin Theroux missed his audition for friends because he slept in  The statement, released by Jennifer's publicist, reads: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.  ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.  ""We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.

After only two months of dating FKA twigs, Pattinson is supposedly really ""smitten"" with the adorable British singer and appears to be seriously in love, according to People magazine. After the Twilight hunk's anguish-filled years with ex Stewart, we really think that twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, is just that much better for him.  Here are five reasons why we think twigs blows Stewart way out of the water, and is a far better match for the hunky actor.  twigs is way friendlier. The half-Jamaican, half-Spanish rising star is so much friendlier to fans both online and offline as well as to eager photographers. She has a much sweeter disposition and does not make your hair stand on end when giving interviews.  She makes him smile. Spotted on a recent shopping trip together, Pattinson and twigs were constantly smiling and laughing as they tried different outfits on. ""They were trying things on, making suggestions to one another, and he seemed to be really having a good time,"" an onlooker told People. This is a far cry from Pattinson's appearances with Stewart, where both always sported mega-pouts on their faces and looked like someone died on a continuous basis.  She makes him feel relaxed. Every time RPatz and twigs are seen together, he seems very relaxed and comfortable with her. They were recently spotted in Paris walking hand in hand looking très snug and cozy with each other. ""They're very cute together,"" another insider added.  She sings. Pattinson loves him some music. So, 'nuff said on this one.  She's classy. No matter how hard Stewart tried, she just never seemed to pull the classy look together. Blame it on her perpetual grumpiness if you will, but the girl just lacks refinement, even while in the prettiest red carpet looks.",0
"That newlywed glow!  Amy Schumer and her new husband, Chris Fischer, walked their first red carpet together at Sunday’s 2018 Tony Awards.  The comedian and Broadway star, 37, was nominated for her role in the play Meteor Shower and her chef love proudly supported her at the annual event.  Schumer was stunning in a low-cut black Brandon Maxwell gown with a thigh-high slit. She slicked her blonde locks back for the occasion. Fischer rocked a matching black suit and tie for the event.  The I Feel Pretty actress shocked fans in February when she tied the knot with Fischer, just days after going public with their romance.  Getty Images  “I’m psyched I found that dude. He’s really supportive and excited for me,” Schumer told ET’s Kevin Frazier in April.  During her opening monologue on a May episode of Saturday Night Live, Schumer revealed some funny details about Fischer’s proposal.  Getty Images  ""The way that my now husband proposed was so worthless,"" Schumer quipped. ""It was such a dumb proposal. It was the morning, I was still asleep. He threw the box at me and said, 'I got you this.'""

"Oprah surprised Tiffany Haddish on ‘The Ellen Show’ and like any sane person meeting Oprah, Tiffany sobbed uncontrollably when her idol stepped out. Watch the clip here!  If you think you’re Oprah‘s biggest fan, think again. Tiffany Haddish proved she loves the Wrinkle In Time star more than anyone else when she cried over her on the Feb. 22 episode of The Ellen Show. While telling a story to Ellen Degeneres about how she was an extra on an Oprah-produced film, the 38-year-old explained that the former talkshow host said to her, “Well, keep me updated on your career, write me, let me know what you got going on.” But the letters always went unanswered. “And so, I would write her, right? She never wrote back,” the Girls Trip star added. Then, Ellen yells out, “Oprah, why didn’t you write back,” and out comes Oprah! Cue a sea of Tiffany’s tears!  After the pair shared the warmest of hugs, they sat down and basically ignored the host of the show. Oprah turned to the comedian and said, “You are so so so good,” which Tiffany hilariously responded between sobs by saying, “Thank you! You told me that before in a dream!” The Keanu star couldn’t contain herself as her idol sang her praise, but when the media mogul explained that she lost her letter, Tiffany called her out with, “But I sent you like six!” We couldn’t love Tiffany anymore than we do after watching this video. Check it out above!  HollywoodLifers, would you also cry literal tears meeting Oprah like Tiffany did?",1
"According to the South African newspaper The Times — which ran a story about her 67-page contract with the concert promoter Kusasa, the organizer of the South African leg of her current tour — she has some interesting personnel requirements, as well.    Onstage with her at all times must be those 11 security guards — eight of whom are to be on chairs that can swivel 30 degrees. (I know there's a lot of kidnapping in South Africa, but that's going a little overboard.)",0

"Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian West aren’t so different – both are massive successes in their respective fields (whether it be singing, reality TV and/or accumulating an impressive social media following) and are constantly in the news for, well, anything they do.  But these two have had a rather interesting history, especially after Kim released footage of Taylor and Kanye West‘s phone call about those “Famous” lyrics, as well as Taylor’s supposed rebuttal in the form of her single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” Let’s take a look back on how we got here.  SEPTEMBER 2009: THE KANYE INCIDENT  It’s important that we start here, even though this situation only involved Taylor and Kanye. You see, since Kanye and Kim later married, Kanye’s past becomes important to Kim’s future. And that time he grabbed the mic from Taylor’s hands during her 2009 VMAs acceptance speech is the root of so much more.  A lot was said about this incident over the years from both sides, from apologies to non-apologies, but Kim didn’t have much to say on the matter – yet.  NOVEMBER 2012: JUST CHILLING  At the 2012 MTV EMAs, Taylor hung out with Kim – who had just started dating Kanye a few months before. They also spent time with Rita Ora , who was dating Rob Kardashian at the time. Yes, yes we were ever so young.  There was also a moment when Kim took a photo for Taylor.  FEBRUARY 2015: GOOD VIBES  Taylor and Kanye were reunited at the 2015 Grammys, and there was no drama to be seen. Taylor enjoyed some nice conversation with Kim. Everyone smiled.  They also embraced! This could really be the start of something beautiful.  They also took a group shot with JAY-Z, because, why not?The whole lovefest sparked rumors of a potential collaboration that West was quick to humor in an interview with Ryan Seacrest . “She wants to get in the studio, and we’re definitely going to go in,” he said. “Any artist with an amazing point of view, perspective, fan base, I’m down to get in the studio and work. I don’t discriminate.”  Sadly, that day never came – but if it had, we would have expected backup vocals from Kim, the artist best known for “Jam (Turn It Up).”  FEBRUARY 2015: PARTY TIME  Britt Awards!!! @TaylorSwift @samsmithworld A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Feb 25, 2015 at 5:54pm PST  The two reunited at the 2015 Brit Awards. Kim shared a group photo with Taylor, Kanye and Sam Smith.  They also had a beautiful moment with Karlie Kloss and Derek Blasberg.  Plus, when Kanye performed, Kim was treated to a front-row view of The Taylor Swift Award Show Dancing Extravaganza. Lucky Kim!  via GIPHY  JUNE 2015: SISTERLY BOND  https://www.instagram.com/p/4c9IgIDvAL/  The squad joined forces at Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour stop in London, kicking off a summer full of guest appearances up on the stage. One certain member of the squad to note: Kendall Jenner, Kim’s sister.  In fact, a few members of Taylor’s friend circle are also friendly with Kim, including Gigi Hadid and Cara Delevingne (who also go by Slay-Z and Mother Chucker).  AUGUST 2015: BEST NIGHT EVER  Six years after that original night at the VMAs, Taylor took the stage to present Kanye with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. “I have been a fan of his since I can remember because Kanye defines what it is to be a creative force in music, fashion and, well, life,” Taylor said in her introduction. “I’m really happy for you, and I’mma let you finish, but Kanye has had one of the greatest careers of all time!”  She then settled in next to Kim in the audience to watch Kanye give an 11-minute speech/rant/proclamation to run for president. Their expressions throughout it all pretty much confirmed their status as #squad.  They laughed.  They applauded.They looked at one another lovingly.They hugged.And for a brief moment, Tay was basically one of the KarJenners.  https://www.instagram.com/p/7OZIdGDvFT/  After that night, Kanye sent Taylor flowers, which pretty much led to her assertion that she would, indeed, be his running mate. She captioned the Instagram photo, “Awww Kanye sent me the coolest flowers!! #KanTay2020 #BFFs.”  Interestingly enough, these flowers beared a striking resembling to his and Kim’s floral wedding wall.  💍 A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 27, 2014 at 7:58am PDT  This also resembles the flower wall Kanye got Kim for her first Mother’s Day. Basically, if Kanye loves you, you get a flower wall.  #MyWorld A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 11, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT  FEBRUARY 2016: THOSE LYRICS  Then things started to get … complicated. At Kanye’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show (which doubled as a listening party for his new album, The Life of Pablo), fans first heard his song “Famous.” In it, Kanye raps, “For all my Southside n—-s that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that bitch famous / Goddamn / I made that bitch famous.”  After some reactions from the Internet (including squad members Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jaime King, plus brother Austin Swift), Kanye took to Twitter to clear up his side of the story. According to him, both Taylor and Kim approved the lyrics prior to the song’s debut.  “I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line, and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings,” Kanye wrote. He went on to say his lyrics about Taylor were “endearing” and that she herself was actually the source of a contentious line. According to him, she was at a dinner with one of their mutual friends when she allegedly said, “I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!”  A spokesperson for Taylor told PEOPLE, “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account.”  Her rep also said, “She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.'”  FEBRUARY 2016: TAYLOR’S RESPONSE  The 2016 Grammys came just a few weeks later. Taylor took home the biggest prize of the night – album of the year – and used that moment to make a powerful speech that many saw as a dig to Kanye.  “[A]s the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice,” Taylor said, “I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”  She continued, “If you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment.”  JUNE 2016: KIM HAS SOME OPINIONS ON THAT  In her cover interview with GQ for their July issue, Kim said that Taylor did green-light the verse mentioning her. “She totally approved that,” she said. “She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t. I swear, my husband gets so much s— for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.”  She continued: “What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?”  Kim also shared that “so many respected people in the music business” heard the phone conversation and that West always keeps cameras rolling while he is recording an album, in case he decides to make a documentary (as one does).  “I don’t know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden,” Kim said. “It was funny because [on the call with Kanye] she said, ‘When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I’m so against this, and I’ll just laugh and say, ‘The joke’s on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.’ And I’m like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.”  Kim said Kanye and Taylor have not been in touch since the latest bout of drama, but he did receive an attorney’s letter from Taylor’s team asking for the video footage to be destroyed.  JUNE 2016: TAYLOR SEES THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY  GQ reached out for comment from Taylor’s side on the whole debacle. A spokesperson for her declined to directly answer questions seeking clarification on the matter, but instead provided the following statement:  “Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian, as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West. However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016, and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do.”  The statement continued: “Kanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term ‘that bitch’ in referencing her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian’s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone.”  JUNE 2016: THE MUSIC VIDEO  Kanye finally released his NSFW music video for “Famous” – and per usual, it got the people talking.  Inspired by Vincent Desiderio’s 2008 Sleep painting, Kanye literally stripped down 12 of the biggest pop culture figures, including Taylor. The video also opened with a snippet of her and background audio from that fateful night at the MTV Video Music Awards.  JULY 2016: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY  On an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the family discussed the longstanding feud between Kanye and Taylor in great detail, as well as Kanye’s controversial rant during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was recorded backstage calling Taylor fake.  When Kanye’s assistant called Kim to let her know about the leaked audio recording from SNL, she got upset, though Kanye didn’t seem too bothered. “My full-time job is your publicist,” she told Kanye. “I care what people think.”  “Kanye says what he wants and he has no filter … and some people may not understand that,” Kim added during her interview. “Usually I try to stay neutral and just give moral support.”  Kim was finally ready to take action when it came to that GQ interview, and she explained to sister Kourtney Kardashian exactly why she felt the need to speak out.  “I never talk s–t about anyone publicly, especially in interviews. But I was just like I had so had it,” she said “I wanted to defend him in it. She legitimately quote says, ‘As soon as I get on that Grammy red carpet I’m gonna tell all the press. Like I was in on it.’ ”  “And then she just didn’t like the reaction?” Kourtney asked.  “Yeah, and you know just another way to play the victim,” Kim added. “It definitely got her a lot of attention the first time,” – referencing when Kanye jumped on VMA stage – “I just don’t think he should be punished for it still to this day,” she continued.  “I feel like I’ve had it with people blatantly treating my husband a certain way and making him look a certain way, and I’m gonna say how I feel,” Kim said during her interview. “Kanye is always so honest and speaks his mind. And you know, when we were first dating, people would always talk s–t and he always had my back. At this point, I really don’t give a f— so I’ll do whatever to protect my husband.”  She then went on to add that Taylor even helped Kanye rewrite the lyrics within the song.  “I’m so glad that you said the truth,” Kourtney told Kim. “Yeah, I’m just speaking the truth,” Kim replied.  At the end of the episode, Kim sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the controversial interview and issues surrounding it. Kris tried to play peacemaker, asking, “What would happen if you just called Taylor up and say ‘What happened? How did this go so south?’ I guess I don’t understand the motivation to flip … maybe she took it the wrong way. My advice would to be give Taylor Swift a call.”  “Thank you for your lovely advice,” Kim told her mother, “but I’m not going to take it.”  JULY 2016: THE VIDEO FOOTAGE  Immediately following that episode of KUWTK, Kim took to Snapchat to provide the proof, sharing a series of videos of that phone call between Kanye and Taylor, discussing the “Famous” lyrics – as well as their history.  “It’s like a compliment,” Taylor is heard saying in the video after Kanye reads the lyrics to her (which include, “For all my Southside n—– that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex”).  “What I give a f— is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good,” Kanye said, and thanked Swift “for being like, so cool about it” after she told him she appreciates the “heads up” on the lyrics.  “I never would’ve expected you to like tell me about a line in your song,” Taylor said. “I mean, I don’t think anybody would listen to that and be like, ‘Oh, that’s a real diss.’ You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it.”  She went on to add, “If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘He called me and told me before it came out … Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine.”  Why might Kim do such a thing, you ask? “Kim is super loyal to Kanye and will always do anything to have his back,” a source tells PEOPLE. “She is even more protective of him than she is of herself. She thinks he’s misunderstood and couldn’t stand that people thought he was a liar.”  The Internet immediately seemed to side with Kim, and #KimExposedTaylorParty started trending.  JULY 2016: TAYLOR SPEAKS AGAIN  Taylor wasn’t about to sit back and watch all this happen – she quickly responded to the videos with a post on Instagram.  “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote in a note.  “Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”  “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,” Taylor continued. She captioned the post, “That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.”  WATCH: Taylor Swift-Kim Kardashian Feud: Internet Sides with Kim on #KimExposedTaylorParty  JULY 2016: THE AFTERMATH  At this point, the whole situation extends far past Taylor, Kim and Kanye – the whole squad is getting involved.  Taylor’s BFF Selena Gomez tweeted, “There are more important things to talk about Why can’t people use their voice for something that f—— matters? Truth is last thing we need right now is hate, in any form.”  Chloë Grace Moretz spoke out against Kim’s actions, too, which led Kim’s sister Khloé Kardashian to clap back against her.  Then, Ruby Rose, another member of the squad, chimed in with: “Yo Khloe I thought you were rad when I met you but this is awful and this is a 19 year old girl. Nobody likes being bullied or made to feel worthless.. Yet so many people will go above and beyond to make others feel that way.”  Plenty more people weighed in – while some of Kim and Taylor’s friends stayed noticeably quiet.  JULY 2016: WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS…  Aside from the drama with Kimye, Taylor hasn’t had the cleanest breakup from her ex Calvin Harris (considering he recently slammed her on Twitter and all).  The two worlds collided over the weekend during Jennifer Lopez‘s birthday celebration at her show in Las Vegas. French Montana shared an Instagram photo in which a whole group – Harris included – posed with Lopez and a cake.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BIPD1qegmiD/  Kim also shared several Snapchats during her night at Hakkasan nightclub in the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, which included dancing along and lip syncing to songs played at the club – and there’s one song in particular she chose to share with her followers.  Kim shared a video of herself and friend Carla DiBello dancing and singing along to Kanye’s now-infamous song, “Famous,” specifically at the moment where he says, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.”  JULY 2016: SELENA SPEAKS AGAIN  Selena also had a birthday to celebrate over the weekend (which Taylor, of course, observed on Instagram), but it didn’t seem quite as positive. Just before performing her hit single “Kill ‘Em With Kindness” to end a show, Selena got emotional and said to the crowd, “The next song, before I go home, is a song that’s so important to me, because I get really frustrated. I get stupid sometimes. I say things that I don’t mean, or that come out wrong, just because I care so badly.”  Selena talking to the crowd in Jakarta. pic.twitter.com/2mMqbpv1Gp — Diana (: (@gomezmalikteam) July 23, 2016  She continued her message, perhaps alluding to the recent feud Taylor has been dealing with versus Kimye, or the negative reaction from fans when she stepped in to defend her BFF. “But the thing is, at the end of the day, no war in anger was ever won,” she said, quoting her hit song. “I do know that deep down in my heart, that I have to believe that we can love each other and always be kind, no matter what it takes in us. I believe that we can do that, no matter what.”  Things took an even more emotional turn later that night when Selena posted a note on her Instagram reflecting on her performance.  “Tonight I felt extremely unauthentic, unconnected to both myself and my music. I’ve never really felt like my materials, wardrobe or a video could define me. I act on a moment and fear that something hasn’t happened. I’m stagnant, I stay still and don’t just sit with myself first and ask ‘Is this where I am, whole heartedly?’ I’ve always told the truth. I’m always true to my word, I’ve shown who I am but I need to rethink some areas of my life creatively and personally.”  She captioned the screenshot, “not being negative about anything I’ve done. I’m grateful for every single moment I get here – Indonesia you were LOUD and clearly inspiring. Love you so much.”  AUGUST 2017: SENDING A MESSAGE  A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 23, 2017 at 7:01am PDT  Ahead of Taylor releasing her first single since Kim leaked a phone call between the “Shake It Off” singer and Kanye on Snapchat, the reality star banned commenters from using the snake emoji on her Instagram. In the edited clips of the call, the pop star appeared to give the rapper her blessing for his “Famous” lyrics. But on Instagram, Taylor asserted that Kanye never told her he was going to call her “that bitch” in the song. “You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote. “He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.”  Still, haters flooded Taylor’s social media pages with the reptile last summer. But now she’s embracing the snake image and using it to promote her new music.  AUGUST 2017: A NEW IMAGE  After spending eight months out of the spotlight, Taylor made her triumphant return, announcing that her new album, Reputation, would be dropping in November. While some fans are saying “Look What You Made Me Do” makes digs at Kanye and Kim, we won’t know for sure until the singer comes forward to confirm those rumors.  DECEMBER 2017: IT STILL ISN’T OVER  famous A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Dec 4, 2017 at 3:51pm PST  Kim took to Instagram to share a throwback snapshot of herself at Kanye’s “Famous” exhibit, which shows a nude row of celebs in bed with the rapper — including Taylor. The photo enraged Swifties so much that the superfans flooded the reality star’s account to post rat emojis.",0
"The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can’t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in. President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not. America does not need more of what comes in illegally over the border, whether it’s people, drugs, or both.Join America’s Patriots Media And Share This Article Now!Source: http://www.independent-reports.com",0

"A diva is the female version of a hustla…or maybe just a pregnant Kardashian-Jenner sister. Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian — who both have babies on the way with their respective boyfriends, Travis Scott and Tristan Thompson — reportedly have crazy demands for their upcoming deliveries.  According to OK! Magazine, Kylie, 20, and Khloé, 33, are “already driving the staff at LA’s Cedars-Sinai hospital nuts.” While the Kylie Cosmetics founder has requested a completely stocked snack bar for her hospital room, KoKo is demanding that her room includes a brand-new bathtub in case she decides to have an underwater birth. On top of that, an insider tells the publication that both moms-to-be have decided that light gray, 1,000-thread count sheets are a necessity during their deliveries.  A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:45pm PDT  Though both Keeping Up With the Kardashians beauties have buns in the oven, neither have confirmed the exciting baby news themselves. However, it seems that both reality stars are looking forward to first-time motherhood.  ""Tristan and I definitely talk about starting a family,” Khloé said on the last season of KUWTK. ""[Tristan] wants to have five or six kids with me and that's lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I'm not on birth control is just like — it's scary. It's like a really big step.”  For her part, Kylie has always wanted to have kids sooner than later. “I want kids for sure. I feel like seeing you guys go through everything, it’s great knowledge,” the lip kit queen said during a February 2016 episode of Kocktails With Khloé. “I feel like I want kids before I’m 30.”  More from Life & Style  Travis Scott Turns to Kanye West for Advice on Dealing With Kylie Jenner's Pregnancy (REPORT)  Kim Kardashian Wants Pregnant Kylie Jenner to Flaunt Her ""Sexy New Curves"" (REPORT)  Kylie Jenner's Latest Photo Has Fans Convinced That She's Pregnant With Twins",0
"Anne Heche and James Tupper have gone their separate ways after more than 10 years together, Us Weekly confirms.  During their time together, the pair welcomed son Atlas, 8, in 2009. According to court documents obtained by Us, the actress, 48, has filed a petition to establish custody and child support. Heche is seeking joint custody and “reasonable visitation” rights for both parents and is also asking that Tupper, 52, pay her legal fees during the court battle.  The former couple first met when they costarred in the ABC series Men in Trees in 2006, while she was married to ex-husband Coleman Laffoon. Heche then ended her marriage to the cameraman, and she began dating the Big Little Lies actor shortly after. The couple moved in together in 2007 and Heche’s rep confirmed that The Brave actress was expecting a child with Tupper in December 2008. During their relationship, the duo worked together on different projects, including the Syfy network’s show Aftermath and NBC’s The Brave.  Although they were together for more than a decade, the pair never married. In a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, Heche described herself as “eternally engaged” to Tupper, and said that she was in no rush to make things official. “I’ve already said yes. When I’m 60 I’m happy to walk down the aisle,” she said, also revealing that he bought her a new ring every year they didn’t tie the knot.  “Well, he’s given me a ring every year so I don’t want to stop that. I have quite a collection,” she said at the time. “Besides, I’ve been married before and so has he. I don’t know what either of us would gain or what would change that would benefit us.”  Heche also shares son Homer, 15, with her ex-husband. Prior to that marriage, the actress was in a high profile relationship with Ellen DeGeneres from 1997 until their split in 2000. Tupper was married to Kate Mayfield, but they divorced in 2006.

"Oprah Winfrey Getty Images  President Donald Trump has long admired Oprah Winfrey, the much-beloved media mogul and self-made billionaire. But that may change now that Winfrey is reportedly considering a 2020 presidential bid herself.  Trump has spoken glowingly of Winfrey over the last few decades, even telling TV host Larry King in 1999 that Winfrey would be his top pick for a vice presidential running mate, should he run.  ""I love Oprah. Oprah would always be my first choice,"" Trump told King. ""She's a terrific woman, she's somebody that's very special. If she'd do it, she'd be fantastic. She's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman.""  And in 2015, Trump again suggested he might pick Winfrey as his presidential running mate, telling ABC News's George Stephanopoulos that the two would ""win easily"" if they teamed up.  ""I like Oprah, what can I tell you?"" Trump said in the interview. ""She's great, she's talented, she's a friend of mine, she's a good person. I've been on her show. … I like Oprah, is that supposed to be a bad thing? I'd love to have Oprah, I think we'd win easily, actually.""  Trump has also publicly praised her on Twitter, tweeting in 2012 that he ""adore[s]"" Winfrey and calling her ""terrific"" in a 2013 tweet.  The president has appeared on Winfrey's long-running daytime talk show multiple times and 30 years ago, in 1988, discussed his possible presidential ambitions.  ""I know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run — would you ever?"" Winfrey asked Trump.  Trump demurred, responding that he had no immediate plans to run for office, but went on to say that he would have ""a hell of a chance of winning"" because he, like many Americans, he argued, is frustrated by trade deals and foreign policy that he said disadvantaged the US.  ""I probably wouldn't, but I do get tired with seeing what's happening with this country and if it got so bad I'd never want to rule it out totally,"" he said.  Trump went on to say that if he were elected president, ""this country would make one hell of a lot of money from those people that for 25 years have taken advantage.""  ""It wouldn't be the way it's been, believe me,"" he said.  Donald Trump and Winfrey. Screenshot/YouTube  Oprah 2020?  Speculation about Winfrey's own political ambitions are mounting after she delivered a powerful speech at the Golden Globe awards on Sunday night, weaving stories of racial and gender injustice into a hopeful narrative that many argued read like a political stump speech.  ""I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,"" she said to a standing ovation.  While Winfrey recently shot down the idea of a possible presidential bid, telling Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning"" in October that there would be ""no running for office of any kind for me,"" she said on Sunday that she would consider a run. Two of Winfrey's close friends told CNN that she is ""actively considering"" a 2020 bid. And Winfrey's longtime partner, Stedman Graham, told The Los Angeles Times on Sunday that Winfrey would ""absolutely"" run if ""the people"" want her to.  In fact, Winfrey told Bloomberg last March that Trump's election inspired her to consider the possibility.  ""I thought, 'Oh gee, I don't have the experience, I don't know enough.' And now I'm thinking, 'Oh. Oh!'"" she said.  Winfrey was a strong supporter of former President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns and she endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. But her political positions are largely unknown.  During a 2008 stump speech for Obama in Iowa, Winfrey said she's voted for candidates on both sides of the aisle.  ""Over the years, I've voted for as many Republicans as I have Democrats, so this isn't about partisanship for me, this is very, very personal,"" she said. ""I'm here because of my personal conviction about Barack Obama and what I know he can do for America.""  The White House responded to the 2020 speculation on Monday.  ""We welcome the challenge, whether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on Monday, adding that Trump will definitely run for reelection.

"Tom Cruise’s ex-wife Katie Holmes is allegedly spending millions of dollars to keep her rumored romance with Jamie Foxx a secret. According to the latest speculation into Katie and Jamie’s personal lives, the alleged couple is spending way too much money during this courtship.  After Katie Holmes decided to end her troubled marriage with the Top Gun star, rumors started to surface that she is having an on-and-off relationship with former Dawson’s Creek’s co-star Joshua Jackson. After that, her name was linked with How I Met Your Mother star Jason Segel. If that was not it, there were several rumors that indicated her inclination toward her The Kennedys: After Camelot co-star Matthew Perry. From the past three years, there are rumors that the 38-year-old Katie is having a secret and serious relationship with 49-year-old Jamie Foxx.  According to an insider who spoke to Life & Style, the alleged couple has put a lot of work into keeping their romance out of the media. Their secret romance is all about secret trips, sworn secrecy, and disguises. Not only this, they have even asked their close friends not to reveal their relationship among the paparazzi.  “Their relationship is warm and passionate and very, very private. Only their closest friends are privy to their love affair,” the source told the outlet.  As previously reported by different media outlets, the real reason behind all the secrecy is Tom Cruise. According to them, Tom will feel betrayed that his old friend and Collateral co-star got involved with his ex-wife.  “Katie would go to Jamie’s house and lie down in the back of a car so she wouldn’t be seen on the way in. Jamie and Katie also felt safe on yachts because no one would see them out on the water. [The secrecy] added passion.”  It was previously reported by the Inquisitr that when Jamie was asked by a reporter at LAX about his alleged relationship with Katie Holmes, the Django Unchained movie star responded by coyly, calling the rumors of his dating life nothing but “fake news.” Similar to this, both Katie and Jamie were photographed together at a romantic restaurant in New York City in April. In the leaked pictures, they both tried to go incognito by sporting sunglasses and hats.  The insider went on to suggest that after having a tough time dealing with the Church of Scientology and her troubled marriage to Tom Cruise, the Batman Begins actress wanted her personal life to go as smoothly as possible. The recent attempts by Jamie are making her extremely anxious, but given the fact that she is deeply in love with him, she is willing to spend $100,000 per year just to have a background check on everyone they hang out with.  “This is not at all how Katie saw her life going. But she will take this over nothing. Katie’s friends are telling her that if he isn’t willing to step up and be there for her as a true partner, it’s time for her to move on,” the insider said. “But she really loves him and can’t seem to let go.”  A lot has been said and published about the personal lives of Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx. There were once rumors that Katie was pregnant, then there were rumors indicating that due to her contractual marriage with Tom Cruise, she is not allowed to publicly date until 2017. Now there are these rumors suggesting that the alleged couple is spending millions just to maintain privacy from the media and Tom Cruise.  Fans of both Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx should remember that neither the stars nor their representatives have confirmed the news about their relationship. So, it is safe to say that Tom Cruise’s ex-wife is currently not involved with the Horrible Bosses star.  [Featured Image by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images and Theo Wargo/Getty Images]",0

"Richard Pryor’s daughter, Rain Pryor, has made a statement saying that her late father did not have a sexual relationship with Marlon Brando.  “Why this sudden need to drag Daddy through the Hollywood mud? I find it tasteless and infuriating,” Pryor wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. “At least get the details right, but of course we live in the age of faux news is real unless we disagree for our own agendas, and people need to stay relevant by dishing dirt.”  The comedian’s daughter pushed back at a Vulture interview in which prolific music producer Quincy Jones first made the claim, saying Pryor would “f— anything. Anything! He’d f— a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.”  Jones was then backed up by Pryor’s widow, Jennifer, who also spoke to Vulture. “Instead of putting labels on it, Richard just saw himself as a sexualized creature, who wasn’t afraid of exploration and experimentation,” she said. “And in the ’70s, of course, we were all doing it.”  Also Read: Quincy Jones Says He Knows Who Killed JFK and 12 More Wild Takes From New Interview  “Daddy did NOT have relations with Brando. There were no trips to his South Pacific Oasis, no flowers or love notes between. Not even a film role,” Rain, whose mother is Pryor’s second wife Shelley R. Bonus, wrote in her post.  “Bottom line. This man Richard Pryor, is not your Hollyweird scandal performance,” she continued. “He is our Daddy. He is our perfect imperfection. He is our legacy and we are most certainly his. So get a life and focus back on what’s really going on in the world.”  In a separate post, Rain took aim at Jones specifically, referring to him as a “brilliant music producer who is losing his mind.”",1
"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.",0
"Not all women want to have children, and that’s perfectly OK. While “normal” people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON’S AND JUSTIN THEROUX’S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE  It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war “Jennifer Aniston Pregnant” was still searched more than “are we at war” on Google.  Jennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends—and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant—could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn’t she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.  Over time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks “bloated,” whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.  MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON BANS THE WORD “BABY” AROUND HER  Take a look at almost two decades worth of pregnancy rumors and how they progressed:",0
"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.",1

"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

"Millie Bobby Brown is best known for her breakout role as telekinetic child Eleven in Netflix's 'Stranger Things.'  Who Is Millie Bobby Brown?  Born on February 19, 2004, Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress. Her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she began earning parts on shows like Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and NCIS. Her big break came with the Netflix sleeper hit Stranger Things, on which she stars as the gifted Eleven.  Early Life & Career  Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress who was born on February 19, 2004. Her family moved back to the U.K. when Brown was four years old and then moved to Orlando, Florida, four years later to start an entrepreneurial business. It was there that she was spotted by a talent scout who told her parents ""she has instincts you cannot teach.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Brown's parents sacrificed everything — moving their family to Los Angeles — to see Brown's acting dreams come true. Within three months of moving, Brown was given the role of Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and soon after she appeared as Madison O'Donnell in BBC America's Intruders. While Brown continued finding work in smaller roles on shows like NCIS, Modern Family and Grey’s Anatomy, she kept getting passed up for bigger roles.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  With no major jump in her career, her family had become so financially strained, they moved back to the U.K. to live with an aunt. ""I was devastated. I wasn’t getting work. I thought I was done,"" said Brown in an interview with the Daily Mail.  'Stranger Things'  However, as things were looking bleak, Brown landed an audition for Netflix's Stranger Things. ""I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park,"" she said. Weeks later, Brown was on a plane to begin filming in Atlanta.  Set in a 1980s Indiana town facing a threat from paranormal activity, Stranger Things became a hit upon its release in 2016, earning an array of awards. Meanwhile, Brown was heralded as one of its breakout performers for her role of Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers.  The show's success was such that its primary actors all scored big raises heading into Season 3, with Brown rumored to be earning as much as its best-known star, Winona Ryder.  In April 2018, the 14-year-old Brown was the youngest person named to Time's 100 most influential list. Writing about her inclusion among the special group, actor Aaron Paul recalled how he was stunned by Brown's wisdom and perspective upon meeting her, feeling like he was talking to a future leader. ""Maybe that's why she's such an extraordinary actor,"" he wrote. ""She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.""

"A sense of untrustworthiness has haunted the Democrat this election, but the roots of hostility against her are much deeper  There is – and perhaps there always will be – a dedicated group of people who don’t know Hillary Clinton personally, but nonetheless hate her.  Whether they are truly a “vast rightwing conspiracy” (as Clinton called them in 1998) or just many in number and conservative in outlook, there’s no arguing that they exist or that they continue to try to influence public opinion on the Democratic nominee.    But even if people consider themselves savvy enough to reject the strangest conspiracy theories (sample claims include that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian faking her 40-year marriage, a member of the Illuminati and/or an agent of the devil himself), there seems little doubt that an undercurrent of hostility spanning decades has had an impact upon how she is viewed.  Clinton’s unfavorability rating may not be as low as Donald Trump’s, but in an election year which has frequently degenerated into name-calling, she has attracted invective from both the left and the right. Polls have frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the “Crooked Hillary” epithet.  Her links to Wall Street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. But the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.  Craig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, said that, when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington DC as first lady, “she came from Little Rock with a reputation already established” as “such a militant feminist, difficult to deal with”.  He noted that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, because she kept her maiden name.“Here she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale,” Shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, “down to Little Rock and brings her attitudes with her”.  There’s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people Craig Shirley, conservative political consultant  So by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be – a potential liability to her husband’s political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly.    And, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. First, there was her much-maligned “I’m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette” comment in response to a reporter’s assertion that she and her husband had “some sort of understanding and arrangement” about his infidelity.  Then, her out-of-context “I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies” comment, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.  And then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she’d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and Travelgate, in which she – contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the president’s staff – was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he arranged.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest President Bill Clinton takes his oath of office, accompanied by Hillary Rodham Clinton, in 1993. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock  The key question raised about Whitewater and Travelgate was not whether Clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal means to try to keep the media from finding out. The Starr investigation, which eventually resulted in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, found that she had not, but by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media who also maybe did not do the right thing.  This business of people ‘not liking’ her is shaped ... by what we think people in authority ought to look like Elaine Kamarck, Brookings Institution fellow  Shirley conceded that “the press pounded on her” first in Arkansas and then in Washington, but did not believe that affected her relationship with the media, or that it was a driving factor in people’s attitudes towards her. “There’s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people,” he said. “People don’t like to be talked down to, and she has a terrible habit of talking down to people, with that smirk.”  However, Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton’s administration, said she did not think that people’s dislike of Hillary Clinton is her own fault. “This business of people ‘not liking’ her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,” she said.    “She is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,” she said. But while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they do not like to their fathers Kamarck noted that Clinton “reminds people of their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didn’t like.” (References to a “nagging wife” and “bitchy wife” are also common.)  “I think there’s some misogyny in that,” said Kamarck, noting that it’s exceedingly common for men who don’t hew to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they meet traditional beauty standards.  “We will overcome this but, right now, the world is accustomed to saying old men are fine, they’re strong, they’re wise,” she added. “Old women, we’re not so sure.”",1
"Jamie Foxx did not “betray” Katie Holmes by supposedly “getting flirty” with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It’s simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, “When Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Foxx “would reach over and touch the woman’s leg or hold her hand” throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is “headed for heartbreak,” quoting its supposed insider as saying, “She needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn’t have any real proof that Foxx got “flirty” with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman’s arm during a conversation. That’s as intimate as the two get in the images and there’s no evidence to suggest they’re anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn’t feel “betrayed” when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx’s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two “don’t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don’t want to be labeled as a couple.” It was further stressed that neither “want to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.”  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us “he knows he’s in a public forum” when he chats with other women. As we’ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx “betrayed” Holmes by “getting cozy” with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn’t feel “betrayed.” That remains the case.",0
"Over the past week, Cambridge-born-and-bred actor Matt Damon has found himself at the center of the #MeToo sexual harassment controversy.  Over the past week, Cambridge-born-and-bred actor Matt Damon has found himself at the center of the #MeToo sexual harassment controversy after giving two interviews on the subject. Here’s a look at what he said, and what the response has been.  Dec. 12: Matt Damon’s ABC News interview  Damon first faced criticism in response to an ABC News interview that aired last Tuesday. Damon spoke with film critic Peter Travers about several men who are facing sexual assault and harassment allegations, including film executive Harvey Weinstein, US Senator Al Franken, and comedian Louis C.K.  In an interview on “Popcorn with Peter Travers,” Damon said that we are living in a “culture of outrage” and that these recent allegations of sexual misconduct need to be analyzed on a spectrum.  Advertisement  “There’s a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,” Damon said. “Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”  Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here  Damon said it’s been a “watershed moment” that women have felt empowered to share their stories and hold men accountable for sexual misconduct. He also said people should try to be optimistic about the state of the movie business and of men overall.  “This [is] like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers,” Damon said. “It’s not everybody. It just feels like it.”  Dec. 15: The response  Damon’s interview was met with criticism, including from actresses Alyssa Milano and Minnie Driver.  Driver, Damon’s ex-girlfriend and “Good Will Hunting” co-star, responded to Damon’s comments in a series of tweets on Friday afternoon.  Gosh it?s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women?s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising) — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017  Advertisement  Milano, who worked with Damon in “Glory Daze” in 1995, responded to Damon’s comments in a Twitter thread last Friday night that began, “Dear Matt Damon, it’s the micro that makes the macro.”  Dear Matt Damon,    It?s the micro that makes the macro.    (Thread) — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  We are in a ?culture of outrage? because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted--even welcomed-- misogyny. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  Milano went on to compare Damon’s spectrum philosophy to the spectrum of cancer.  We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it?s still cancer. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  Sexual harassment, misconduct, assault and violence is a systemic disease.

Please send flowers. #MeToo — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  Dec. 17: Minnie Driver continues her criticism  In an interview with The Guardian published Sunday, Driver expanded on her reaction.  “I felt I desperately needed to say something,” Driver told the publication. “I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.”  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse,” Driver continued. “A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  I don?t just speak for myself in this article, I speak for too many friends and co-workers as well. - Minnie Driver: men like Matt Damon 'simply cannot understand what abuse is like' https://t.co/Z9M120C6XZ — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 17, 2017  Advertisement  “How about: it’s all f****** wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not,” Driver continued. “Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.”  Dec. 18: Damon speaks with Business Insider  Damon continued defending men in the entertainment industry in a Monday interview with Business Insider. He said more attention should be focused on the men who don’t commit acts of sexual misconduct.  “We’re in this watershed moment, and it’s great, but I think one thing that’s not being talked about is there are a whole s---load of guys — the preponderance of men I’ve worked with — who don’t do this kind of thing and whose lives aren’t going to be affected,” Damon said.  Dec. 19: The response  Damon was called out on Twitter yet again by various Hollywood figures, including actresses Rose McGowan and Debra Messing.

"The Hollywood premiere of Wonder Woman on Thursday got a double dose of Diana Prince. Gal Gadot, who plays the titular heroine in Patty Jenkins’ film, joined original Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter on the red carpet.  Carter, who starred on the beloved TV series in the 1970s, previously teamed up with Gadot at the United Nations last year, when Wonder Woman was named an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls. (The U.N. ultimately dropped that campaign two months later, after the initiative was met with criticism.)  “In some magical and mystical way, there lies within each of us Wonder Woman,” Carter said at the time. “She is real. She lives and she breathes. I know this because she lives in me, and she lives in the stories that these women tell me, day in and day out. I see it in the letters and in the stories. I read it on social media. I see it in the tears that fall from the eyes of the women who say it saved them from some awful thing that they endured — because they saw that they could do something great.”  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Gadot slipped on the Amazonian gauntlets first for Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She now headlines her own Wonder Woman movie, due in theaters June 2. Based on early reviews, the future looks bright for Diana. Gadot will also reprise the role on screen for Justice League.  The two actresses were photographed bowing down to each other in front of the cameras and director Jenkins. “What a wonderful movie!! Gal Gadot is fabulous as Wonder Woman. I had so much fun at the premiere,” Carter tweeted on Friday.  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Alberto E.

"One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's ""no ring, no bring"" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the ""no ring no bring"" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.",1
"A Bad Moms Christmas is a 2017 American Christmas comedy film written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. It is a sequel to the 2016 film Bad Moms. The plot follows the three moms from the first film (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn) dealing with their own mothers (Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon) visiting during the Christmas holiday.  Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia in May 2017, and the film was released by STXfilms in the United States on November 1, 2017. It received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at the thin story and raunchy jokes, and grossed over $130 million worldwide.[3]  Plot [ edit ]  Amy (Mila Kunis) is now in a happy relationship with Jesse (Jay Hernandez) and is looking forward to having a simple Christmas. Her plans are derailed when her overly critical mother, Ruth (Christine Baranski), texts her to say she is coming for Christmas.  Meanwhile, Kiki (Kristen Bell) is still overworked with her four kids but now her husband Kent is much more helpful. Kiki is surprised when her mother Sandy (Cheryl Hines) shows up three days earlier than expected and is planning to spend the next three weeks with Kiki. Sandy's love for Kiki is overwhelming, and smothering Kiki.  When Carla (Kathryn Hahn) gets home, her mother, Isis (Susan Sarandon), has arrived, telling her she intends to spend time with her for the first time in years. Surprised by this turn of events Carla is excited to spend time with her. Eventually, Amy, Kiki and Carla go to the mall where they express their misery over the holidays. But while commiserating about the pressures of the holidays they make a pact to ""take Christmas back"". Ruth tries to create a spectacle out of Christmas, rather than keeping it simple like Amy wanted. In an effort to tamp down those plans Amy takes the family to Sky Zone to meet up with Kiki and Carla and their families. Ruth, Sandy and Isis all meet and chat while their daughters have fun with their kids.  At work, Carla meets an erotic dancer named Ty (Justin Hartley), who says he is competing in a Sexy Santa competition and he asks Carla to be his date, which she enthusiastically accepts. Kiki continues to have issues with her mother's overbearing ways and decides to bring Sandy to Dr. Karl (Wanda Sykes) to discuss these issues. This leads to a breakdown in communication leading to Kiki scolding Sandy and causing her to leave the session.  Amy and Kiki join Carla as they attend the Sexy Santa show. All the ladies in the room are impressed with Ty's dancing. To everyone's surprise, Isis gets up on the bar and starts dancing with Ty. Carla runs up to get Ty back, leading to a fight. When Carla brings Isis home, Isis tells her she needs money for a new investment, but Carla knows she's just going to gamble it all away and then disappear from Carla's life like it's been for years. Nonetheless, Carla relents and loans Isis the money.  On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki that she put up a cash offer for the house next door so that she can live right next to Kiki. Finally, Kiki lashes out and tells Sandy she cannot live next door and that she wants some space. Sandy leaves the room crying.  Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers Ruth has invited a bunch of strangers over to her home to throw an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy did not want. Amy loses her temper and demands everyone leave her home and tells Ruth to leave and get out of her life forever. Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a note from Isis indicating she has just taken off with the money she lent her. Kiki is all alone as well.  Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass and is, surprisingly, joined by Sandy and Isis. All the ladies criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, with each of them realizing their flaws. Amy's father, Hank, goes to her to talk about Ruth and the horrible fight they had, but acknowledging that while Ruth can be difficult to deal with, Ruth has always been incredibly insecure, always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but she always had the right intentions and loved Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church where Ruth is in order to try and repair her relationship with her mother. The two apologise to each other, with both confessing how much they genuinely love each other. Ruth tells Amy that she is a wonderful mother. The two embrace tightly. As the clock strikes midnight, Amy realises that she needs her mother to help her fix Christmas. The two rush home to start decorating the house properly.  On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan go downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looking wonderful with decorations and gifts. Kiki makes up with Sandy, who tells her she put the neighboring house on the market and admits that she's just always felt lonely on Christmas since Kiki's father died. Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone.  All the families get together and Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  In December 2016, it was announced that A Bad Moms Christmas would be released on November 3, 2017, and that it would be Christmas-themed, with Bell, Hahn, and Kunis returning to reprise their roles.[4][5] The release date was subsequently moved up two days to November 1, 2017.[6] In April 2017, Justin Hartley joined the cast of the film,[7] and in May 2017, Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines joined as the mothers' mothers, alongside Wanda Sykes and Jay Hernandez reprising their roles from the first film.[8]  Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia on May 1, 2017.[9][10]  Release [ edit ]  A Bad Moms Christmas was released on Wednesday, November 1, 2017. It was originally scheduled for November 3, 2017, but was pushed back two days to avoid direct competition with Thor: Ragnarok.[11]  In Australia, the film was released under the title Bad Moms 2.  Home media [ edit ]  The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on February 6, 2018 in the United States and Canada.  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  A Bad Moms Christmas grossed $72.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.6 million, against a production budget of $28 million.[2]  In North America, the film was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,615 theaters in its first five days (including $17 million over the weekend).[12] It took in $2.7 million on its first day,[13] and $17 million over the weekend, for a five-day total of $21.6 million, finishing second at the box office behind Thor: Ragnarok.[14]  Critical response [ edit ]  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on 116 reviews with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Featuring twice the moms but roughly half the laughs, A Bad Moms Christmas is a slapdash holiday sequel that falls short of the original with a disappointing dearth of good cheer.""[15] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[16] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale, down from the ""A"" earned by the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a ""very low"" 68% overall positive score.[13]  Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing, ""A Bad Moms Christmas should appeal to the same—dare I say it?—demo that Bad Moms did, even though it's not nearly as wild a comedy. It has one halfway original idea, which is that when you're a mom yourself, the ability of your own mom to drive you nuts is heightened to the third power, because you're competing on levels that are almost primal.""[17] Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it a ""good time movie"" and writing: ""...it goes way over the top, but I have to confess I laughed—a lot—and that's obviously the point even if this is not critic's fodder or meant to be. Subtle this is not, but A Bad Moms Christmas is the perfect tonic to lift your spirits and forget your troubles in these dark times.""[18]  Three New Zealanders, following in the footsteps of Kiwi heroes Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery (of ""The Worst Idea of All Time""), are watching this film every week for a year (52 times in total) for their podcast ""The Even Worse Idea of All Time"".",1

Jeter joined the team on May 29, 1995, when the Yankees’ starting shortstop was benched with an injury.  In 1996, Jeter received the American League Rookie of the Year award. In 2014, after 20 years in baseball, multiple Golden Glove and MVP awards, and five world championships, Jeter retired, with his career hits ranking sixth in major-league history.  As of April 2017, Jeter’s net worth was $185 million, according to TheRichest.  You can use Bankrate’s net worth calculator to see your net worth.

"This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.  In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx’s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they’re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors “one hundred percent not true.” Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, “What I’ve learned about society today is that they’re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they’re so thirsty to find any story… Sometimes when you read the stuff you’re like, ‘Wow! That’s so not true!’” Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, “That’s not something I want to answer.”  Despite JamKat’s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they’ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx’s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx “is very happy with [Holmes].” Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, “I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” adding, “I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her.”  Still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie’s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston’s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That’s because Foxx and Holmes’ intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes’ 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.  Long before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior—the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.  One of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney’s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise’s second marriage: “I was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.”  According to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige—a good friend of Cruise’s—became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney’s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige’s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, “auditing” Cruise, and “re-educating” the couple’s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.  A 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, “The organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‘What do you think of Tom Cruise?’” The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: “In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.”  When Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement “specifically about Cruise,” claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: “By the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology’s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise ‘wants someone with her own power—like Nicole.’ When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.” (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment prior to publication.)  By April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s couch.  According to journalist Tony Ortega, who’s covered the church since 1995, “Katie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.” Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress’ Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, “Jessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.” Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples’ six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise’s best man at his and Holmes’ 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that “his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,” in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.  As The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise’s young daughter, Suri: “When Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org—an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a ‘billion-year contract.’” Cruise and Holmes’ hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri’s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in “more than 1,381 days.” This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church’s practice of “disconnecting” congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.  A RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx’s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, “Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the source continued. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”  And the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes’ bizarre ex.",0
"CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device  Back in April, Angelina Jolie was named the most admired woman on the planet in a global online survey, ahead of Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Malala Yousafzai.  But very soon after, the 43-year-old actress, director and globe-trotting humanitarian began to appear in not-so-admiring news stories reporting that she had been accused by a judge of undermining estranged husband Brad Pitt’s relationship with their six children.  Jolie started to come across even to friends as “crazy and manipulative” for going public earlier this month with her efforts to portray Pitt as a deadbeat dad, having her lawyers say he was shirking his responsibility to pay his fair share of childcare expenses, Page Six reported.  So perhaps it’s no surprise to learn this week that she and Pitt quietly reached a temporary custody agreement that would put off arguing their respective cases in a court hearing, according to People.  Actually, this interim custody agreement keeps in place the one imposed by a judge in June, which said that “Angelina must let Brad see the children,” a source close to Pitt told Page Six. The agreement also may only put off the custody hearing for a few weeks, the source added.  Still, there appears to be a temporary truce in play. Was this a matter of Jolie “waving the white flag,” as Us Weekly put it?  Another Page Six report earlier this week said that Jolie’s decision to escalate her fight against Pitt was losing her friends in Hollywood — according to some of those friends. And she was already upset that she had lost Amal and George Clooney as close friends after she filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016.  Moreover, with the Clooneys taking Pitt’s side in the breakup, Jolie also was developing an “insane” jealousy over Amal Clooney, an international human rights attorney and mother of 1-year-old twins.  Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six. The source added: “Angelina hates all the attention that Amal is getting — she’s beautiful, she’s smart, she’s stylish, she has a beautiful family and she’s doing important human rights work.”  Jolie’s humanitarian reputation began to take a hit in June when details spilled out about how a Los Angeles County judge said she risked losing custody if she continued to interfere in Pitt’s relationship with their three sons and three daughters, Maddox, 17, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 10-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  Saying it was important for the children’s welfare to have strong bonds with both parents, the judge set up a detailed summer visitation schedule and prohibited Jolie from barring Pitt’s phone and and text access to them.  Family law experts say the judge’s admonition was unusual in that courts generally trust parents to make the best decisions for their children. “But when a parent is proving they’re not acting in that way, the court will start imposing sanctions,” Christopher Melcher, a Los Angeles-based family law attorney, told this organization in an interview in June.  Melcher, who is not associated with the Jolie-Pitt case, added it’s pretty “rare” for a judge to tell a parent he or she could lose custody if a certain behavior doesn’t change.  “I imagine there were some pretty serious warning signs before the judge made this ruling,” he said.  A source told Page Six that “Angelina lives in such a bubble” in not being able to “understand why she herself has become so unpopular in Hollywood.”  Jolie’s “bubble” was based in London this summer, where she was filming “Maleficent 2.” The children spent much of their summer in London with Jolie, People reported. However, the judge’s visitation schedule allowed Pitt to spend time with the children there and then to have them stay with him in Los Angeles for about a week, where he is based and where he has been shooting Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”  In the past few weeks, Jolie and the children have been back in Los Angeles, where they have been spotted shopping at Whole Foods or going to a movie.",0
"Two reality stars met in the Oval Office on Wednesday. One wanted a presidential pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother serving life in prison without parole for a drug crime. The other wanted a presidential pardon for Dinesh D’Souza, America’s greatest troll.  Guess which star became a media joke?  Kim Kardashian West met Donald Trump in the White House Wednesday to lobby for prison reform and to ask him to pardon Johnson, who went to jail more than 20 years ago after getting involved in a cocaine ring. In a viral interview, Johnson told Mic that her son had died, she’d been divorced, and she needed the money. “I couldn’t find a job fast enough to take care of my family,” she told Mic. “I felt like a failure.”  Kardashian was moved by the interview.  This is so unfair... https://t.co/W3lPINbQuy — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 26, 2017  Trump heard out Kardashian. Then he released a photo of the two of them in the Oval.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018  The New York Post went with not one, but two references to Kardashian’s rear end on its Thursday cover. The image was retweeted and liked thousands of times.  Tomorrow's cover: Kim Kardashian visits the White House to discuss prison reform with President Trump https://t.co/1N3bNkVmK7 pic.twitter.com/yPaL93Tyhe — New York Post (@nypost) May 30, 2018  It’s tempting to say that Kardashian just isn’t serious. She’s a reality star. She makes millions selling a brand on top of questionable products. But Trump, too, is a reality star. He, too, makes millions selling a brand on top of questionable products. The difference is that Trump is the modern male archetype. Kardashian is his female foil.  The reaction to Kardashian is a window into how we think about male and female leadership. Trump is an alpha man who never backs down, never apologizes, and never accepts “no.” He gets to be president. Kardashian is the modern female archetype — she is thin (except in the places it’s difficult to be plump), she is ageless, and she glamorizes motherhood. Her politicking is treated as a joke.  Celebrities draw attention to causes all the time — and it works. The media flocks to cover events when big names get involved in policy. Whether it’s Bono testifying on the state of AIDS resources, Brad Pitt meeting with Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi on sustainable housing, or Ashley Judd taking on saving wolves, the coverage usually takes them seriously along with the issue.  Trump’s rise is proof of the phenomenon. He was irresistible to TV news during the 2016 campaign. He still is.  But even advocates of prison reform didn’t see Kardashian, perhaps the best publicity-getter in America, as any kind of help. In a response to my colleague German Lopez’s explainer on yesterday’s meeting, Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, wrote him the following email:  President Trump’s reported meeting with Kim Kardashian West to discuss prison reform makes light of one of the biggest crises that we face in our country today. Prison reform is a complex issue that requires expertise and knowledge of where some of the greatest racial disparities lie. I am not aware that Ms. Kardashian West brings the requisite record of experience to tackle these issues on a national scale. In short, this proposed meeting is outrageous and makes clear that this administration does not deem prison reform a real priority.  Many organizations rely on celebrities to draw attention to their cause. Clarke’s organization, for example, has highlighted “special guests” at their annual gala, like Laz Alonso, a Hollywood star from box office hits like Avatar; Mike Tomlin, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers; and Jim Nantz, a CBS sports personality.  Perhaps the only person better at using celebrity for promotion than Trump is Kardashian. But when she takes up a cause, no matter how significant, her role as a feminine icon overshadows it. We laugh at the idea of the perfect woman having something important to say. But it’s not funny at all.",0
"Justin Bieber may want to take a trip to his tattoo artist soon.  The 24-year-old singer got engaged to Hailey Baldwin on Saturday, but he still has his tattoo dedicated to his ex-girlfriend -- Selena Gomez -- on his left wrist. On Tuesday, Bieber and Baldwin were snapped together in New York City, where the tattoo -- featuring a girl with long hair, meant to be Gomez -- was still clearly visible.  TheImageDirect.com  TheImageDirect.com  Bieber previously talked about attempting to cover up the tattoo in February 2016. ""This is my ex-girlfriend,"" he told GQ, pointing to the distinct ink. ""So, I tried to cut her face up with some shading, but people still know.""  Clearly, Bieber's tattoos are important to him. Last June, he showed off his ""Better at 70"" tattoo on his leg, which he actually referenced again in his Instagram confirming his engagement to Baldwin.  ""My goodness does feel good to have our future secured!"" he wrote of his and Baldwin's engagement. ""WE'RE GONNA BE BETTER AT 70 BABY HERE WE GO!""  Meanwhile, a source previously told ET that 25-year-old Gomez is unbothered by Bieber's engagement. The ""Wolves"" singer was snapped on a relaxing boat cruise with friends in NYC on Sunday after the news broke, and on Tuesday, she stepped out with a huge smile on her face.  Bieber and Gomez rekindled their romance late last year, but cooled off again in March. Before his engagement, he and Selena had been dating on and off since 2010, and even Baldwin appeared to previously be a fan of their longtime romance in now-awkward resurfaced tweets that she's since deleted.  “She does not care at all,” the source said of Gomez's reaction to Bieber's engagement. “What [Bieber and Baldwin] do with their lives does not impact her. Selena is in such a great place and is surrounding herself with good, positive people, and Justin and Hailey’s happiness doesn’t take away from her own happiness.”  “Things just roll off her back now,"" the source added.

"First comes love, then comes marriage? No. First comes money, then comes marriage, according to a new report, which claims Rihanna and Hassan Jameel headed to the alter! But, they’re reportedly protecting their massive fortunes first.  The first sign of true love and trust is an iron-clad prenup, right? Well, according to a new report, both Rihanna, 29, and her new rumored boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, 29, are in the midst of planning a wedding! However, business is business. “Everything is moving so fast, but right now the priority is working out their individual assets with their attorneys in order to write up an ironclad contract,” a source tells Life & Style magazine. So, what numbers are we exactly working with, here? Rihanna and Hassan are reportedly hashing out a prenup worth more than $1 billion; you know, nine zeros…  “They’re crazy about each other, but they both know that a prenup is a good idea,” the insider says. So, here’s the alleged understanding — “Both parties agree that what they bring into the marriage, financially speaking, is what they’ll leave with.” Ultimately, Rihanna and Hassan have reportedly agreed to keep the contract as simple as possible. Basically a what’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is yours, type of situation; because, again, this is what love is all about.  Once the alleged prenup is dealt with, the couple reportedly plans to get married, outside of the U.S. “They want to exchange vows to be special to who they are and where they come from, which means Barbados for her and Saudi Arabia for him, probably in Riyadh,” the source says. And, get this — “Having two weddings is a big possibility.” Wow.  And, there’s no price tag too high for everlasting love. “They obviously aren’t concerned about money,” according to the mag. “What they both want is to be in a gorgeous location, surrounded by family and friends. They can’t wait to get married.” This is cute. However, neither Rihanna and Hassan have addressed the marriage reports. Not to mention, they don’t even have more than a few photos together at this point.  One person who did confirm their romance? — Rihanna’s father, Ronald Fenty. “She told me she had a new boyfriend. But, I didn’t know who he was,” Fenty tells the mag. And, he even offered up a stern warning to Ri’s new man. “He’s going to have to buckle up,” Ronald says, because Rihanna’s “very independent and ambitious. Nobody can tell her what to do.” Father knows best!  Rihanna and Hassan were first romantically linked on June 27, when they were spotted kissing in a private pool in Spain. The pair vacationed at an exclusive villa and looked smitten with each other in steamy, PDA photos. Rihanna’s romantic getaway was the first time she was spotted with a new man since she and Drake, 30, split in Oct. 2016.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Rihanna and Hassan are the real deal?",0

The fact is, Demi is looking better than ever, and maybe it's because she just shed 170 pounds of STRESS, if you know what I mean.

""You've got me in my hotel, arresting in my hotel for doing what, sir?""  When an officer asks if they can talk, LaBeouf declines from the backseat of a cop car. ""Take these cuffs off,"" he demands. ""I am (expletive) American. I pay my taxes. Get this (expletive) off my (expletive) arms.""  ""Who you fighting for?"" LaBeouf continues antagonistically. ""You got a president who don't give a (expletive) about you, and you stuck in a police force that don't give a (expletive) about you. So, you want to arrest — what, white people who give a (expletive), who ask for cigarettes?""  In this July 8, 2017 photo released by the Chatham County Sheriff's Office, actor Shia LaBeouf poses for a booking photo, in Savannah, Ga. (Photo: AP)  LaBeouf then gives his account of the prior events. ""I came up to you trying to be nice, you stupid (expletive),"" he says. ""I came up to you asking for a cigarette, you dumb (expletive). Why would I ask for a cigarette if I was racist, you stupid (expletive)? I was asking for a cigarette. You said, 'No.' I said, 'Word.' And then you arrested me, you dumb (expletive).""  He also throws his fortune in the officer's face. ""I got more millionaire lawyers than you know what to do with, you stupid (expletive).""  In LaBeouf's apology tweet, he says that his behavior is ""a new low"" for him.  ""My outright disrespect for authority is problematic to say the least, and completely destructive to say the worst,"" he says. ""I have been struggling with addiction publicly for far too long, and I am actively taking steps toward securing my sobriety and hope I can be forgiven for my mistakes.""  The arrest is the second for the actor in 2017. In January, he was handcuffed outside of the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens after getting into a scuffle at the site of his He Will Not Divide Us anti-Trump art project. The charges were later dropped for lack of evidence.  Contributing: The Associated Press  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uitDEt",1

"Selena Gomez revisited her childhood home recently and shared a thoughtful post to Instagram reflecting on where she’s been and how far she’s come since then. “The home I grew up in, from birth to 13... (no one was home when I knocked this time lol),” she captioned the photo of herself perched on the front stoop. “I visit this place every chance I get. In many ways it very well could have been better than my life today, but I’m grateful for a voice that can enable change today. Even when I don’t know how to do it well or actually want it. I love you Grand Prairie. Thank you. ❤️”  Loading View on Instagram  Gomez was born and raised in Grand Prairie, Texas, but made the move to Los Angeles when she was in her early teens after she landed the lead role of Alex Russo on Disney Channel’s Wizards of Waverly Place . She currently resides in a $2.5 million ranch house in Studio City, California, that features three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms in the main house, with an additional bedroom and bathroom in a separate space that could be converted into a studio or guesthouse. The singer snapped up the 3,188-square-foot home last May after selling her Fort Worth, Texas, mansion in February of the same year. (The 10,000-square-foot home was listed for $3 million and featured 1.5 acres of extravagance, including a saltwater pool, a putting green, an outdoor kitchen and cabana, and a tennis and basketball court.)",1
"It's no secret that Houston Texan J.J. Watt has always had a crush on Jennifer Aniston. All you have to do is look at his Twitter feed: ""Anybody who knows me knows my one lifetime crush has been Jennifer Aniston"" reads a tweet from February 12, 2014.  Now it looks like dreams do come true — even for NFL superstars. On Monday night, Watt met his lifetime crush, and he couldn't help exulting about it. He tweeted the photo above, with the caption, ""I'm not even going to try to pretend like I acted cool when this happened. #LifeMade""  We're guessing the duo met in Los Angeles, where Watt will appear on the ESPY Awards Wednesday night. The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year is up for Best Male Athlete alongside Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors), LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers). He's also a nominee for Best NFL Player along with Tom Brady (New England Patriots), Antonio Brown (Pittsburgh Steelers), DeMarco Murray (Philadelphia Eagles) and Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers).  But even if he doesn't take home the sports award, he's had quite an offseason, cavorting with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in Paris, pretending to be a security guard for the Zac Brown Band, doing a dead-on impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger and flying in a private plane — which still excites Watt, even though he's a multimillionaire.",0
"Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian continue to be hella cryptic about their rumored pregnancies.

"The luckiest lad in Newcastle! Duchess of Cambridge obliges with a hug after cheeky request from youngster during royal walkabout  The royal visit is Kate’s first official trip to the North East  Husband William was paying his respects at the funeral of his former nanny  Kate recycled a berry-coloured coat from last Christmas at Sandringham  Young fan Terry Campbell said she had very soft skin after his hug  Kate revealed that she grows her own potatoes    Friends of schoolboy Terry Campbell learnt an important lesson from their classmate yesterday: If you don’t ask, you don’t get.  The cheeky ten-year-old managed to get a full hug from the Duchess of Cambridge simply by holding his arms out wide for her.  Terry was among a group of children from a local school who were waiting excitedly outside Newcastle’s Civic Centre for a glimpse of Kate.  Scroll down for video  Stockton was just one of the stops on the Duchess's whirlwind tour of the North East, her third official engagement is as many days  Young Terry Campbell aged 10 from Morpeth Road Primary School in Blyth was the luckiest boy in Newcastle today after receiving a cuddle from the Duchess of Cambridge  When she saw him gesturing she opened her arms and asked: ‘Am I going to get a cuddle as well?’ Without a second thought she then leant over the steel barrier and embraced him.  Terry, wearing his school uniform under a green hoodie, went a brighter shade of red moments later and appeared almost lost for words when asked what it had been like to cuddle a real-life royal.    As the Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Stockton this afternoon she was greeted by hundreds of excited locals who has been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the beautiful Royal.  Kate arrived to cheers from the crowds lining Prince Regent Street as she paid a special visit to the CRI Stockton Recovery Service.    Write caption here  Hundreds of well wishers lined the streets waving Union Jack flags to welcome the Duchess  And the hundreds of people who waited patiently behind the barriers to catch a glimpse of the princess were not left disappointed as Kate worked her way down the line with a beaming smile on her face.  'She’s absolutely beautiful - she really is fantastic,' gushed Diane Holder, 64, from Ingleby Barwick, 'She has beautiful hair - she is just a beautiful woman!'  Kate was in Stockton to pay a special visit to The Stockton Recovery Service which supports people aged 18 and over who are adicted to drugs.    As a patron of Action on Addiction she was particularly moved to meet families involved in Action on Addiction’s Moving Parents and Children Together (M-PACT) programme.  The CRI-run service in Stockton is one of the charity's licensed partners and the focus of this visit was to learn about their work with children living with parental substance misuse and addiction.    The Duchess of Cambridge greeted crowds outside Newcastle’s Civic Centre  Stockton was the third stop on the Duchess's packed itinerary on her first official visit to the North East. Earlier in the day as she greeted crowds outside Newcastle’s Civic Centre she made her way along to a group of school children who had been waiting excitedly all morning for a glimpse of the Royal. Among them was 10-year-old Terry who had vowed to get a hug from the Duchess – even maybe a kiss. And he was far from disappointed when his moment arrived. As the Duchess made her way along to the cheeky youngster he immediately held his arms out wide. The Duchess then asked him: ‘Am I going to get a cuddle as well?’ Without a seconds thought she leant forward over the steel barrier and embraced the schoolboy. ‘It was good,’ he said, still slightly stunned by his first encounter with royalty. ‘I was hoping to get a hug from her when we came here this morning. ‘I never actually thought it would happen. I can’t believe she hugged me back. ‘She was everything I thought she would be. She was really nice.’ A school friend interrupted: ‘The one thing he really wanted though was a kiss.’  Among them was 10-year-old Terry Campbell who had vowed to get a hug from the Duchess    As the Duchess made her way along to the cheeky youngster he immediately held his arms out wide    Without a seconds thought she leant forward over the steel barrier and embraced the schoolboy    VIDEO: The luckiest boy in Newcastle...a huge hug from Kate!  Unfortunately for Terry he missed out on a kiss but the school pupil from Morpeth Road Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, is unlikely to ever forget the day he shared a cuddle with the future Queen.  He was among 11 pupils from the school who were taken on the trip to Newcastle to see the Duchess.  His teacher Kim Ramsey, 32, said: ‘I never imagined when we set off this morning that terry would actually get a hug from Kate.  ‘I don’t think there was much planning that went into it. We asked the children to come up with a question for her and he decided he was going to ask for a hug.  ‘He’s such a cheeky little lad. He just said: ‘I’m going to stick my hands out and get a hug.’  ‘I never thought she’d actually agree to it. It was a wonderful moment.’  Kate was delighted to spend time in the gardens with the children  Kate played with the local children who were dressed in plastic ponchos to keep clean and dry  Elswick Park was just one of the venues that the Duchess visited on her first solo engagement to the North East  Write caption here  Kate chose a burgundy wool coat worn cinched in with large buckled belt and her favourite suede knee high boots for the visit to Newcastle    Schoolboy Terry appeared almost lost for words when asked what it had been like to hug a real-life princess.    'I was hoping to get a hug from her when we came here this morning,' Terry said KATE RECYCLES ANOTHER WINTER WARMER  Another official engagement = another recycled dress coat for Kate, the queen of thrifty chic. And this three-quarter length berry-coloured coat has special significance in the Duchess's wardrobe. Kate chose the deep burgundy piece for her first Christmas day at Sandringham as wife of William, where she was spotted making another little boy's day as she left Sandringham Church after the traditional Christmas Day service last year. The high-necked jacket was reported to be made by an independent British designer and Kate wore a hat in a matching wine coloured velvet by Jane Corbett, one of the Middleton family's favourite milliners. Hat's a winner: Another happy young fan greets the Duchess on a sunny Christmas day in 2011    The royal visit is Kate’s first official trip to the North East, and speaking ahead of the visit, the Lord Mayor said: 'This is indeed an honour for the whole city and it will give us an opportunity to showcase our talents in education, sport and science as well as our international work.' The Duchess’ first engagement was at Newcastle Civic Centre where a range of people - from those who contributed to making the Olympic Games a success in Newcastle to volunteers who help make the city centre a more welcoming place for people and businesses - were waiting to meet her. Inside Newcastle Civic Centre, Kate met representatives from a number of community organisations which have been helping residents and businesses and working to improve life generally in the city. She even tried her hand at the Paralympic sport of boccia, a form of bowls, when she joined two disabled players in motorised wheelchairs from the local Percy Hedley School, which teaches children with cerebral palsy and motor disorders. The Duchess sat between Michael Bell, 17, from Durham, and Richard Armstrong, 16, from Birmingham. As she was handed a red bowl, she said: 'The pressure’s on' and predicted it would 'go rolling off the carpet.' Her first effort hit the white jack ball and stopped six inches away but Richard proved to be the master of the game, making a succession of throws which hit or came close to the target. Kate’s second effort sailed past the jack but her third and final throw made her gasp as it came within a whisker of hitting the target before rolling two feet away. Michael, who performed a little worse than the Duchess with his bowls, conceded: 'She was doing better than what I was doing, but she should come down and see some of our other sports like wheelchair basketball.'

She was greeted by 200 children and members of the public who were waving flags and cheering.  Some of the children also passed her gifts, including flowers and jam. Kate was shown around a community garden and helped plant some seeds before continuing through the park. A plaque was then unveiled and a girl from a local school presented the Duchess with a bouquet of flowers. The park is protected under the Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge, which seeks to protect and create hundreds of playing fields across the country. The community garden was set up in 2009 to give girls and young women the chance to learn how to grow vegetables and plants. Kate revealed to community garden Emma Hughes that like thousands of keen gardeners around the country, she grows her own veg. Ms Hughes said after the visit: 'She grows her own potatoes in sacks. We were digging the potatoes and she was asking about it. She said ours were bigger. She said she only got small ones this year.'

Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2007 Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $140 million.[7] She has been named the world's most beautiful woman by People a record five times.  Early life and family [ edit ]  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][8] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][8][9] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[10][11] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Roman Catholic,[12] and she was raised Catholic.[13][14] Her older brother, Eric Roberts, from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, sister Lisa Roberts Gillan, and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors.  Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts was their daughter Yolanda Denise King's acting coach.[15] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[16]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[17] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[18] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[19] The couple had a daughter, Nancy Motes, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[20] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[19] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[21]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[22] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[23][24] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[25][26]  Acting career [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series Crime Story with Dennis Farina, in the episode titled ""The Survivor"", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film Mystic Pizza in 1988;[27] that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of Miami Vice. In 1989, she was featured in Steel Magnolias, as a young bride with diabetes, and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actress) and first Golden Globe Award win (Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress) for her performance.[27]  1990s [ edit ]  Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella/Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990.[27] Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.[28] The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy).[27] Her next box office success was the thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, playing a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. She played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook in 1991, and also played a nurse in the 1991 film, Dying Young. This work was followed by a two-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, ""What Happened to Julia Roberts?""[29] She was offered the role of Annie Reed in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham's 1992 novel of the same name.[27] In 1996, she appeared in season 2 of Friends (episode 13 ""The One After the Superbowl"").[31] She had a relationship with cast member Matthew Perry at the time.[32][33][34][35] According to an audience member, Roberts said to Perry about their on-screen kiss, ""I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend.""[36] She was offered the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz in While You Were Sleeping (1995), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Liam Neeson in Michael Collins (1996).[27] That same year, she starred in Stephen Frears' Mary Reilly, which was a commercial failure. In 1997, however, she enjoyed renewed success with the romantic comedy My Best Friend's Wedding. In 1998, she appeared on Sesame Street opposite the character Elmo, demonstrating her ability to change emotions. She was offered the role of Viola de Lesseps in Shakespeare in Love (1998) but turned it down.[30] She starred in the films Stepmom (1998), alongside Susan Sarandon,[37] Notting Hill (1999), with Hugh Grant, and, also in 1999, in Runaway Bride, her second film with Richard Gere. Roberts was a guest star on the Law & Order television series episode ""Empire"" with series regular Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[38]  2000s [ edit ]  In 2000, she played the lead role of real-life environmental activist Erin Brockovich in the film Erin Brockovich.  In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest-paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 50 most influential women in show business since the list had begun in 1992.[3]  In 2001, Roberts received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Erin Brockovich. Roberts' acceptance speech for the award went over the allowed time limit but did not mention the real-life Brockovich, for which Roberts later apologized, saying she forgot.[39] While presenting the Best Actor Award to Denzel Washington the following year, Roberts made a gaffe, saying she was glad that Tom Conti wasn't there; she meant the conductor, Bill Conti, who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor.[40]  Roberts' first film following Erin Brockovich was the road gangster comedy, The Mexican, giving her a chance to work with long-time friend Brad Pitt. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[41] Later in 2001, she starred in the romantic comedy America's Sweethearts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked ""sympathetic characters"" and was ""only funny in spurts.""[42] A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however.[43]  In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven, a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played Tess Ocean, the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is dating a casino owner played by Andy García. In preparation for her role, Roberts studied Dickinson's performance by watching the original film at least seven times in order to get her part right.[44] A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean's Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of US$450 million worldwide.[45]  In 2003, Roberts was cast in Mike Newell's drama film Mona Lisa Smile, also starring Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles. Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.[46] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it ""predictable and safe"".[47]  In 2004, Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols's Closer, a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name.[48] The film also starred Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.[48] Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to what the film's characters believe is their strong resemblance.[49] Though less well reviewed than Eleven, the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.[50] Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series' third and final installment, Ocean's Thirteen (2007), due to script issues.[51] In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single ""Dreamgirl"" by the Dave Matthews Band; it was her first music video appearance.[52]  Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005.[5]  Eat Pray Love, September 2010 Roberts in Paris promoting, September 2010  Roberts had two films released in 2006: The Ant Bully and Charlotte's Web. Both films were animated features for which she provided voice acting.[53][54] Her next film was Charlie Wilson's War (2007), with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols; it was released on December 21, 2007.[55] Fireflies in the Garden (2008), also starring Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe, was released at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas; it did not get a North American release until 2011.[56]  Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg's 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[57] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with ""self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.""[58] Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that ""it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.""[58] Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, ""Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain—even if three days of it can seem an eternity.""[59]  In 2009, Lancôme announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company.[60]  2010s [ edit ]  Roberts at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival  Roberts starred with Clive Owen in the comedy-thriller Duplicity for which she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. In 2010, she appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, with Cooper, and starred in the film adaptation of Eat Pray Love.

"Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.“You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?” Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.Read more:Rep.

"Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani weren’t always so sure their romance was built to stand the test of time.  During a preview of the singer’s upcoming Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist interview, Shelton, 42, admitted that both he and Stefani, 48, initially thought their relationship was strictly a “rebound.”  “When I was going through my divorce, I hit rock bottom, just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,” Shelton told Geist. “It’s a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time.”  Continuing, he added, “If Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought, ‘This is a rebound deal.’”  Shelton and Stefani met as coaches on The Voice and started dating in 2015, not long after Shelton’s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani’s divorce from Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani John Shearer/ACMA2018/Getty  RELATED: Gwen Stefani Joins Blake Shelton Onstage as He Jokes About ‘Messin’ Around’ When They First Met  Shelton went on to say that neither of them were sure things would become serious, because they were both “coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives” and were “kind of clinging to each other to get through this.”  “But now here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it’s going to the next level,” he remarked.  The country singer previously hinted at their not-so-serious origins in September 2017, when he was joined by Stefani for an intimate concert at his Ole Red Tishomingo venue in Oklahoma.  While jokingly discussing their relationship, Shelton explained they “started hanging out together and messing around.”  After Stefani — who had brought along her three sons — appeared surprised by his admission, he added, “you know, texting each other.”  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton REX/Shutterstock  The former No Doubt frontwoman also addressed the beginning of their romance on her 2016 album This Is What the Truth Feels Like.  On “Truth,” she sings, “And they’re all gonna say I’m rebounding, so rebound all over me.”  RELATED VIDEO: Gwen Stefani and Her Kids Spend Spring Break in Blake Shelton’s Native State of Oklahoma  While discussing what the future holds for the pair, Shelton admitted to CMT’s Cody Alan that while he is contemplating marriage, fans shouldn’t be waiting on pins and needles for an engagement announcement.  “I think about it. I don’t think it’s anytime soon or anything,” Shelton said when asked about walking down the aisle. “The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you’d be getting to that.”  See Shelton’s full interview Sunday, June 24th on Sunday TODAY.",0

"Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose.  Knox, the American exchange student convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial.  Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.  Knox, now 30, was referred to at the time as a 'sex-mad American party girl' and an 'evil temptress'.  Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice in which she interviews women, including Mischa Barton, (pictured above) who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality  Knox has revealed she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life  'I could have been the kinkiest person in the world it and it shouldn't have mattered because it has nothing to do with the evidence of the case,' Knox told Newsweek.  'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd.  'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out.  'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.'  In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life.  'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said.  'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.  Knox wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. One of the women she interviews is model Amber Rose (above) who has publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'  Knox's show The Scarlet Letter Reports premiere's on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Pictured above is a behind the scenes look at her interview with Mischa Barton  Knox (right on right) and Barton (left) filmed a segment of the show speaking about how the OC actress filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her  'I'm not alone in that. As soon as you've been labelled something, as soon as you've been given that catchy salacious nickname, the real you is gone and you are absorbed into this template character.'  Knox now wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports.  The show, which is for Vice's Broadly and will be broadcast on Facebook Watch, includes Knox's interviews with women including Mischa Barton, Amber Rose and Brett Rossi.  Barton filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her, while Rose has previously publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'.  'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA.  'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality.  'Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.'  Knox, above in 2007, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her British roommate  Knox was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. She has been dating her author boyfriend Christopher Robinson since 2015  Knox said she came up for the idea for her new show before the #MeToo movement started in October 2017 when scores of women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment and rape.  'It's an incredible time to be a woman. We're redefining what it means. I'm amazed and so grateful to be a part of it. I never thought I would be here,' Knox told Newsweek.  'Not too long ago, I thought I would be spending the best decades behind bars for something I didn't do.'  Knox, a student from Seattle, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.  She was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life.  Knox started dating and then got engaged to musician Colin Sutherland in 2015.  The couple split sometime that year and Knox started dating Seattle poet and author Christopher Robinson in late 2015.",1
"Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn’t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  “He had reservations at the time because they still hadn’t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen — and probably always will be — but marriage was never important to him,” the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. “Marriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn’t need it.”  But Aniston did. “Constant scrutiny of Jen’s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,” the source tells Us. “It was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn’t want to lose her, so they got married.”  In the end, things didn’t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The separation was caused in part by distance. “Jen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,” a source previously told Us. “New York City wasn’t ever going to be home for Jen.”  With reporting by Jen Heger.

"Academy Award winner George Clooney, who was given his first major big-screen role by Harvey Weinstein, has become the latest—and most high-profile—member of Hollywood to speak out on the alleged sexual-misconduct allegations against his sometime employer.  “It’s indefensible. That’s the only word you can start with,” he says. “Harvey’s admitted to it, and it’s indefensible. I’ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We’ve had dinners, we’ve been on location together, we’ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I’ve never seen any of this behavior—ever.”  Clooney spoke to me at length about the allegations—as well as charges of Hollywood complicity—during a phone conversation late Monday.  His remarks come in the wake of statements released by Meryl Streep and Dame Judi Dench, two actresses who’ve won Oscars for Weinstein-shepherded films and who took the bullying movie mogul to task for allegedly preying on vulnerable young women for 30 years, resulting in at least eight settlements, according to a bombshell New York Times exposé.  Weinstein’s accusers, among them the actress Ashley Judd, shared similar horror stories: a “business meeting” at a lavish hotel suite soon gave way to a series of sexual propositions, including watching him shower. One local TV reporter, Lauren Sivan, claimed that Weinstein cornered her in the bowels of his restaurant, told her to “be quiet,” and masturbated into a potted plant.  Weinstein, the former co-chief of Miramax, has since been fired from The Weinstein Company—which he co-founded with his brother Bob—and many of the male actors and filmmakers in particular who have benefited from the studio executive’s Oscar Midas touch, from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting) to Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), have remained alarmingly silent.  Clooney, on the other hand, was anything but.  How did you react to the Harvey Weinstein news?  I’ve heard rumors, and the rumors in general started back in the ’90s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn’t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we’re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn’t hear anything about that and I don’t know anyone that did. That’s a whole other level and there’s no way you can reconcile that. There’s nothing to say except that it’s indefensible.  The thing I’ve been seeing online is that, in the wake of Meryl Streep’s statement, and knowing that he helped guide her to an Oscar for The Iron Lady, many people are saying, “Oh, she had to know.” But that seems both incredibly speculative and unfair.  A lot of people are doing the “you had to know” thing right now, and yes, if you’re asking if I knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure. But I had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence, and that these women were threatened and victimized. I’ve been talking with a lot of people about this, and I don’t know many people who knew of that.  Sharon Waxman over at The Wrap said she was working on a story about Harvey over 10 years ago at The New York Times and they killed it, and if that’s true, then that’s a shameful thing because a lot of women wouldn’t have been made victims if this had come out. By the same token, I do want to say that Sharon’s been running her own influential website, The Wrap, for quite a long time, and if she did these interviews and this investigation, she didn’t run the story either, and I and a lot of other people would have liked to have known it. A good bunch of people that I know would say, “Yeah, Harvey’s a dog” or “Harvey’s chasing girls,” but again, this is a very different kind of thing. This is harassment on a very high level. And there’s an argument that everyone is complicit in it. I suppose the argument would be that it’s not just about Hollywood, but about all of us—that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don’t speak up, you’re complicit. And there’s no question about that.  Hollywood can be good when it comes to certain progressive causes, but this area—preying on women—seems to be a pretty major blind spot. The “casting couch” and the “creepy, lecherous producer,” these are concepts that are so firmly ingrained in the industry that they’ve become troubling clichés, and go all the way back to Golden Age studio chiefs like Louis B. Mayer and David O. Selznick.  I hear you. At the same time, I know an awful lot more people in this business who have nothing to do with that, and I suppose if I went looking I could probably find three or four names of people that I would suspect of doing that. The other part of it is, I’d like to think that if someone came up to me and told me this was going on that I would go out and confront it. I’ve told this story about a night with Silvio Berlusconi, and I hadn’t told all the specifics about it before, but perhaps I should have been more graphic about how vulgar that was in a way to take some responsibility—each of us, in our own individual way—of talking about people with a lot of power using it and holding it over others in some ways.  But on the other hand, maybe that’s what good will come out of this: that not just in Hollywood, although Hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don’t need to be afraid.  This is an interesting moment. I’ve seen a lot of people, from Meryl [Streep] to Judi Dench, come out and say “holy shit,” and I think that that’s been the reaction by a lot of people in Hollywood. I don’t think that people were looking the other way; I think that people weren’t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.  So when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it’s a news story. And this is a big news story now. And I feel very bad for all of the victims. I mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant? That’s not just some rumor about Harvey hitting on a woman; it’s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up. That’s frustrating. If politicians knew these stories, I doubt they’d have been taking donations from him at the DNC [Democratic National Committee], and I hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.  Those on the right, from Fox News to Donald Trump Jr., have used the Harvey Weinstein news as a cudgel against liberals. It’s a bit rich on Trump Jr.’s part, given the numerous allegations against his father.  Yeah, that’s a little pot and kettle there, unfortunately. But I think that everything gets politicized these days. The reality is that this is a problem deeply ingrained in our society. It was something that was talked about a lot on the left with Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, and Donald Trump, and it’s something that’s going to be talked about a lot on the right with Harvey Weinstein. I think that rather than politicize it, there should be talk on both sides about the really bad behavior by powerful men and the horrible acts they commit. It’s pretty crazy to me.  It is so firmly ingrained in the culture now. We just elected a man president who’s been accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women and was caught on tape bragging to a relative stranger about his ability to sexually assault women at will. One of the strange things about the Harvey news is it emerged around the one-year anniversary of that Trump Access Hollywood tape.  That is a funny part of it: In “liberal” Hollywood the guy loses his job, but then this other guy [Trump] gets elected president. There are a couple of good things that have to come out of this, because something good has to come out of this. One of those things is that victims have to feel safer to come out and tell their stories without the fear of losing their jobs, and they also need to be believed, which is a very important element of this. Also, this should be a shot across the bow that people in places of power cannot abuse that power, and if you do, you’ll be outed publicly, shamed, and even prosecuted. When it comes to most of the people that I know, where we’re shocked is by how bad it was. This is about show business but it isn’t just about show business—it’s about everything. We need to get to a place where we can call these people out much quicker before it becomes such a deeper, long-running problem. This apparently went on for almost 30 years.  People did know that Harvey was a terrible bully, though. It was interesting how Hollywood approached it, because he was almost treated like a caricature—the angry, bellowing studio mogul. I remember there was a character on Entourage based on him. It was treated almost like a joke.  Think about it this way, too: I had knock-down, drag-out fights with him over the years, but he was also making films that other studios weren’t willing to make, and he was making films that everybody loved, so you just put up with certain bad behavior because you felt like, well, if he yells and screams but he gets Pulp Fiction made, who cares if he yells and screams? But it’s a very different conversation when you say, it’s not that he yells and screams but that he’s cornering a young, scared lady in a restaurant and telling her to stand there and be quiet while he jerks off. That’s a very different kind of behavior, and had that been a public thing, I think there would have been some different results. I hope there would be.  Why do you think people are holding him accountable now? I wrote a piece about how there seems to be a lot more accountability surrounding issues of sexual assault and misconduct in Hollywood, and that it’s perhaps a reaction to the Cosby revelations, which served as a wake-up call for a lot of people in the entertainment media space—that in covering celebrities you can’t gloss over the dark details, otherwise you’re mildly complicit. Also, it’s so important how there are more women now in both Hollywood and newsrooms who feel empowered to speak up and hold those in power accountable.  Hopefully, this kind of behavior will end—or become harder and harder for it to continue. What’s important now is that anybody who thinks that they can get away with doing that, they now have to think: Wait, somebody can be recording this or writing a story about it. I’m going to get in a lot of trouble. That’s good, because we’ve seen this type of behavior in politics, in Silicon Valley, and in corporate America. This is a big problem in our society, that people in power are taking advantage of people not in power—particularly powerful men with young women. Maybe Cosby was the watershed moment. I think Roger Ailes was also a watershed moment, because it concerned an establishment figure up to some very shady stuff. But this isn’t a right or a left issue; this is a moral issue. We’re all going to have to be more diligent about it and look for any warning signs. Before, people weren’t paying enough attention to it. Now we have to. This is the moment to start scaring people like this into not acting this way anymore.",1
"Kylie Jenner attends the 2015 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)  Here are a selection of headlines People.com has posted over the past few days:  Pregnant Kylie Jenner Wants an ‘Easy Birth’, Says Source: She’s ‘Open to Pain Medicine’  Pregnant Kylie Jenner ‘Hasn’t Hired a Nanny’: She’s ‘Worried About New People Around the Baby’  Pregnant Kylie Jenner Has a Baby Name Picked Out for Her Daughter  Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet — Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal — some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as “sources” and “insiders” dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie’s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news — reported by the tabloids in September and described as a “happy” surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family’s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie’s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn’t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie’s first public appearance since the fall, although she’s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as “We’re Expecting!” (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)

Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie’s baby’s debut for quite some time.  “She very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can’t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,” a “source” told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. “She doesn’t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.”  Read more:  As Kim and Kanye welcome baby No. 3, the Kardashian deluge of 2018 has officially started  Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention  Perspective | Here’s why Chicago is actually a great name for Kimye’s baby",0
"Follow­ing therap­y, actor has come to realis­e that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

"On this day in 2003, 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart is finally found in Sandy, Utah, nine months after being abducted from her family’s home. Her alleged kidnappers, Brian David Mitchell, a drifter who the Smarts had briefly employed at their house, and his wife, Wanda Barzee, were charged with the kidnapping, as well as burglary and sexual assault.  In the middle of the night on June 5, 2002, Elizabeth Smart, then 14 years old, was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom in her parents’ house in the upscale Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City. Her captor slid into the house undetected after cutting open the screen of an open window. Elizabeth’s younger sister, Mary Katherine, with whom she shared her bedroom, was the only witness to the kidnapping. Mary Katherine did not inform her parents until two hours after the incident, frightened that the man might return for her if she called out to alert them. She was initially unable to identify her sister’s attacker.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Elizabeth was taken to a crude campsite in the woods just three miles from her family’s home–close enough that she could actually hear the voices of searchers calling for her in the days following her abduction. There, it is alleged that Mitchell, who calls himself Emmanuel and professes to be a prophet with his own Mormon sect, sexually assaulted her.  After two months, Smart, who was forced to wear a wig and dress in a robe and veil, was taken to Salt Lake City and appeared in public, but was not recognized. From there, Mitchell and Barzee took Smart to San Diego, where they lived in a series of campsites and under bridges. Finally, the group returned to the Salt Lake City area and, just a couple of hours later, several people recognized Elizabeth. They reported their sightings to police, who immediately followed up on the lead and pulled over a car carrying Mitchell, Barzee and Smart.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Most of the early police investigation into Elizabeth’s disappearance had focused on another suspect, Richard Ricci, who had also once worked as a handyman in the Smart home. Serving time in prison for a parole violation during the investigation, Ricci denied having any involvement in the kidnapping. The trail grew cold after Ricci died in prison of a brain hemorrhage on August 30. Finally in early February 2003, Mary Katherine Smart told her parents she believed another former worker at the Smart home, who called himself Emmanuel, might be Elizabeth’s captor and the Smarts relayed the information to authorities. On February 3, believing that the police were not taking Mary Katherine’s tip seriously, the Smart family called their own press conference to release a sketch of Emmanuel. Several days later, a man contacted police to inform them that Emmanuel was his disturbed stepfather, Brian David Mitchell, and that he believed him to indeed be capable of kidnapping. In the days before finding Elizabeth, the Smarts continued to criticize police for failing to devote enough energy to following up on the lead.  When found, Smart, who called herself Augustine, most likely at the behest of Mitchell, initially denied to police that she was in fact Elizabeth Smart. Undeterred, police took her and her captors in separate cars to the Salt Lake City Police Department, where she was reunited with her family. On March 18, 2003, after Mitchell and Barzee were formally charged, Mitchell’s attorney announced that his client considered taking Elizabeth a call from God. It has since been reported that Mitchell believed Smart was his wife and that the young girl may have suffered from Stockholm syndrome during the nine-month ordeal, answering questions as to why she did not try to escape even though it seemed she had been presented with several opportunities.  Police later discovered that Mitchell had also attempted to kidnap Smart’s cousin several weeks after taking Elizabeth and added that crime to the list of charges against him. Mitchell was declared mentally unfit to stand trial in July 2005 and December 2006; Barzee, who filed for divorce from Mitchell in December 2004, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in the kidnapping in November 2009. On May 25, 2011, after being ruled competent to stand trial in March 2010 and convicted that December, Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison.",1
"Look What You Made Me Do is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 24, 2017 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from her sixth studio album Reputation (2017). Swift wrote the song with her producer Jack Antonoff. ""Look What You Made Me Do"" is an electroclash and pop song,[2] with lyrics about various issues that built Swift's reputation. Right Said Fred band members Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Rob Manzoli are also credited as songwriters, as it interpolates the melody of their song ""I'm Too Sexy"" (1991).  The song broke a string of records, including the record for the most plays in a single day on Spotify. Commercially, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" has topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has also received Platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, Italy, Sweden and the United States. It also received Diamond certification in Brazil.  The song received a mixed response from music critics. Its music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and upon its release on YouTube, it attained the most views in its first 24 hours of release, more than any other music video on the site[3], later surpassed by the K-pop band BTS with ""Idol"" in August 2018.[4]  Promotion and release [ edit ]  On August 23, 2017, Swift announced that the first single from her upcoming sixth album, titled Reputation, would come out the following night.[5] The song was released to streaming services on August 24,[6] and earned over eight million streams within twenty-four hours of its Spotify release, breaking the record for the highest first-day streaming for a single track.[7] The record was surpassed in 2018 by Drake's ""God's Plan"".[8] ""Look What You Made Me Do"" was then released the next day onto iTunes for digital download through Big Machine Records[9] and onto Italian contemporary hit radio[10] before a United Kingdom radio release on August 26, 2017.[11] It impacted American contemporary hit radio three days afterwards.[12] A CD single release followed in Germany on October 27, 2017.[13]  A lyric video heavily based on the Saul Bass imagery used in the film Vertigo was released through Swift's official Vevo account on August 25, 2017.[14] The video was produced by Swift and Joseph Kahn.[15] It gained more than 19 million views during its first 24 hours on YouTube, surpassing ""Something Just like This"" by The Chainsmokers and Coldplay as the most viewed lyric video within that time period.[16] As of October 2018, the lyric video on YouTube has amassed over 100 million views.  Composition and lyrical interpretation [ edit ]  ""Look What You Made Me Do"" runs for 3 minutes and 31 seconds.[9] Music critics have described the track as a hybrid of electroclash and pop,[2] as well as a dance-pop[17] and an electro-pop song.[14] It emphasizes the blame that is placed on an enemy, in particular the line ""I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"". The middle eight of the song features Swift saying, ""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now / Why? / Oh, 'cause she's dead!""[citation needed] ""Look What You Made Me Do"" is performed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 128 beats per minute.[18] Swift's vocals span from G 3 to F 5 .[18]Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone noted a ""nightmarish aesthetic"" present in the song, and believed it to be a continuation of the ""antagonistic persona"" from ""Bad Blood"".[17] Richard Fairbrass, Fred Fairbrass and Rob Manzoli, the members of the British dance-pop group Right Said Fred, are credited as songwriters because the song interpolates the melody of their song ""I'm Too Sexy"".[19][20] According to Fred Fairbrass, he and his brother were contacted one week before the release of ""Look What You Made Me Do"" and were asked whether a ""big, contemporary female artist who hasn't released anything for a while"" – whose identity they were not told – would be able to use a portion of their song for her latest single.[21] Although the brothers agreed to a deal, they did not officially find out that the artist in question was Swift until the morning after the song was released, but had deduced that it was her based on the description they were given.[21] Both of the Fairbrass brothers said that they enjoyed ""Look What You Made Me Do""; Fred Fairbrass told Rolling Stone, ""I like the cynical aspect of the lyric, because 'I'm Too Sexy' is a cynical song, and I think she channeled that quite well.""[21] A representative for Swift confirmed that the song interpolated the melody from ""I'm Too Sexy"", but did not include sampled audio from the earlier song.[22]  Critical reception [ edit ]  ""Look What You Made Me Do"" received mixed reviews from critics.[23][24][25] USA Today said that the polarizing reaction to the song illustrated Swift's position as a ""ubiquitous cultural force"".[26] The Telegraph Randy Lewis praised the song, deeming Swift and Antonoff's work as ""blow[ing] past the production clichés of clap tracks and hiccuped syllabic hooks that have proliferated across Top 40 fare in recent years with boldly inventive textures and fresh melodic, rhythmic and sonic accents"". He also added how the track musically and sonically shifted alongside the lyrics.[27] Sarah Carson of the Los Angeles Times wrote a positive review of the song, saying: ""The reverberating crescendo builds and ever more delicious is the wickedness of Swift's menacing protagonist"", praising Swift for her successful embrace of the villain character the media has portrayed her as previous to the song's release.[28] Variety's Chris Willman also praised Swift's embrace of a darker-styled pop music and the stylistic conflict between the song's pre-chorus and chorus.[29] Mark Harris, in New York magazine's pop culture blog, thought of Swift's song as a pop art anthem for the Trump era in how she reappropriates her public feuds as empowering badges of honor without acknowledging her own responsibility or blame.[30]  However, the single received more criticism than her previous lead singles. Maura Johnston of The Guardian wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the ""sloppy"" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics.[14] Lindsay Zolad of The Ringer said ""Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and — yes, really — Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy, except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred."" Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone believed that the song marked a continuation of the feud between Swift and rapper Kanye West; the latter had previously name-dropped Swift in his song ""Famous"" by using the line, ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous"". The single was noted as being a darker, angrier work than what Swift had done before.[17][31] Hugh McIntye of Forbes was critical of the change in style, saying that it ""didn't sound like [Swift]"" and that it ""may have some kinks to work out"".[2] Meaghan Garvey from Pitchfork referred to it in a review as ""a hardcore self-own"" track.[32]  Chart performance [ edit ]  In the United States, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" debuted at number seventy-seven on the Billboard Hot 100, powered by its first three days of airplay.[33] It also sold slightly under 200,000 digital copies within its first day of sales in the country, where it became the fastest selling download since Ed Sheeran's ""Shape of You"".[34] One week later, the song ascended from No. 77 to No. 1 on the Hot 100 after its first full week of tracking, becoming the fifth largest rise to the top position and Swift's fifth number-one single in the United States. It ended the 16-week reign of ""Despacito"". It also topped the nation's Streaming Songs chart with 84.4 million streams, becoming its most streamed song within a week by a female artist and second overall behind the 103 million that Baauer's ""Harlem Shake"" gained in 2013. The track also had more weekly streams in the US than any other song in 2017. The song stayed atop the charts for three consecutive weeks, tying with American rapper Cardi B's ""Bodak Yellow"" as the longest running female at the number one spot on the charts in 2017. With 353,000 copies sold in its first week, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" opened atop the US Digital Songs chart and had the country's biggest sales opening since Justin Timberlake's ""Can't Stop the Feeling!"" in 2016 as well as the best weekly sales for a song by a female artist since Adele's ""Hello"" in 2015. The track also became the country's first number-one song with a female artist since Halsey was featured on ""Closer"" by The Chainsmokers and the first song with a female lead artist since Sia's ""Cheap Thrills"" with Sean Paul (both in 2016). It additionally was the first solo song by a female to top the US charts since Adele's ""Hello"".[35] It remained atop the Hot 100 and Streaming Songs charts for a second week with 114,000 copies sold and 61.2 million streams, though descended to number two on the Digital Songs chart when another Reputation track titled ""...Ready for It?"" debuted at number one with 135,000 digital copies sold and opened at number four on the Hot 100. As a result, Swift became the first artist to have two tracks sell over 100,000 digital copies in the nation within a week since Sheeran with ""Shape of You"" and ""Castle on the Hill"". It also became the first time a female had two songs within the top five of the Hot 100 since 2015 when Swift's previous tracks ""Blank Space"" and ""Shake It Off"" respectively were at numbers four and five on the chart.[36] The single also topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart, becoming Swift's eighth single to do so.[37] However, a week after reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40, it moved to number 7, being the largest fall from the top in the chart's history; and from number 5 to number 20 on the all-format Radio Songs chart, the biggest drop from the top five in that chart's 27-year history.[38]  In the United Kingdom, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" sold 20,000 copies and was streamed 2.4 million times in less than a week.[39] The song debuted at the top the UK Singles Chart on September 1, 2017 – for the week ending date September 7, 2017 – with opening sales of 30,000 copies and 5.3 million streams within the week and becoming Swift's first chart-topping song in Britain.[40] After two weeks at the top spot, it was displaced by Sam Smith's ""Too Good at Goodbyes"".[41]  ""Look What You Made Me Do"" also debuted at number one in the Republic of Ireland on September 1, 2017 and became Swift's first song to top the Irish Singles Chart. In doing so, it surpassed the number three peaks of her singles ""Love Story"" (in 2009) and ""Shake It Off"" (in 2014).  ""Look What You Made Me Do"" opened at number one in Australia on September 2, 2017, becoming her fifth track to top the ARIA Charts.[42] It spent another week at the nation's summit[43] before ""Too Good at Goodbyes"" took the top position there as well.[44] The song has been certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 70,000 units.[45] After debuting at number one on the Canadian Hot 100,[46] ""Look What You Made Me Do"" was also certified Platinum by Music Canada for shipments of 80,000 units on September 14, 2017.[47]  In New Zealand, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" entered at the number one spot on September 1, 2017, becoming Swift's fourth chart-topping single there.  In the Philippines, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" debuted at number 7 spot on the Philippine Hot 100 on its first week. A week later, it soared to the number 1 spot, ending the 10-week reign of ""Despacito"" by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber. It descended to the runner-up position the following week, as the latter song reclaimed the top spot for an 11th week.  Music video [ edit ]  Production and release [ edit ]  Preparation for the music video began in January 2017, while the shooting took place in May.[48][49] The dance was choreographed by Tyce Diorio, who had worked with Swift on ""Shake It Off"" before.[48] Swift's make-up as a zombie was done by Bill Corso.[49] Post-production of the video lasted until the morning of its release.[49] A 20-second music video teaser was released on Good Morning America on August 25.[50]  The song's music video premiered on August 27, 2017 at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[51] The video broke the record for most-watched video within 24 hours by achieving 43.2 million views on YouTube in its first day. This record was surpassed by Korean group BTS with their music video for ""Idol in August 2018.[52] It topped the 27.7 million Vevo views Adele's ""Hello"" attracted in that timeframe (only to be surpassed by Ariana Grande's ""Thank U, Next""), as well as the 36 million YouTube views of Psy's ""Gentleman"" video.[53][54][55] It was viewed at an average 30,000 times per minute in its first 24 hours, with views reaching over 3 million views per hour.[52] As of November 2018, it has over 990 million views, making it the 89th most-viewed Vevo video of all time and has reached 8.0 million likes on YouTube, making it the 26th most-liked YouTube video of all time.  It was also reported that the diamonds used in a scene were authentic. The diamonds, loaned from celebrity jeweler Neil Lane, were said to be worth over $10 million, hence triggering tight security measures.[56] The video was named the fifth best music video by Rolling Stone and the sixth best music video by Billboard.[citation needed]  Synopsis [ edit ]  The bathtub scene in the music video. The diamonds used were authentic and worth over $10 million.  Swift has said that part of the premise of the video is rooted in the idea that, ""If everything you write about me was true, this is how ridiculous it would look.""[57] It is a satirical send-up of media theories about her true intentions that have little validity. The video begins with a zombie Swift crawling out of a grave, where the headstone reads ""Here Lies Taylor Swift's reputation"", and digging another grave for her Met Gala 2014 self. The next scene shows Swift in a bathtub filled with diamonds. She is then seen seated on a throne while snakes surround her and serve tea. Swift later crashes her golden Bugatti Veyron on a post and sings the song's chorus holding a Grammy as the paparazzi take photos. She is also seen swinging inside a cage, robbing a streaming company in a cat mask, and leading a motorcycle gang. Afterwards, she gathers a group of women at ""Squad U"" and dances with a group of men in another room. At the video's climax, Swift is seen standing in a T-shaped throne while clones of herself (from her past music videos), struggle and fight against each other trying to reach her. As the video concludes, the clones bicker with one another, describing each other as ""so fake"" and ""playing the victim"" while one clone of Swift in the background watches in silence. The video ends with a 2009 VMA Swift saying ""I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative"" and the other Swifts yelling at her to ""shut up!"" in unison.[58][59]  Analysis [ edit ]  The video contains numerous hidden meanings and references. In the opening scene, there is a subtle ""Nils Sjöberg"" tombstone shown when Swift is digging up a grave, referencing the pseudonym she used for a songwriting credit on Calvin Harris' 2016 single ""This Is What You Came For"".[60] Similarly, Swift—masked as a cadaveric version of herself in the ""Out of the Woods"" music video—was shown digging a grave for herself in a 2014 Met Gala gown, an event that characterized her first public appearance with short hair.[citation needed] A single dollar bill in the bathtub full of diamonds that she bathes in was also speculated to symbolize the dollar she was awarded for winning a sexual assault trial earlier in 2017.[60] Interpretations for the bathtub scene were contrasting. Some believe that it is a response to media statements teasing that she ""cries in a marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.""[61] Others speculate that the bathtub scene is a jibe at Kim Kardashian, wife of Swift's long-time feuding partner, Kanye West. Some viewers took the scene as a reference to Kardashian's 2016 robbery, in which she was robbed jewelry worth over $10 million while held at gunpoint at a hotel in Paris, France.[62][63] Others argued the claim was unfounded, as Kardashian was not in a bathtub during the robbery.[citation needed]  In a separate scene, Swift is shown sitting atop a golden throne, where a carving of a phrase ""Et tu, Brute?"" could be seen on the armrest, a reference to Shakespeare's drama Julius Caesar.[60] Swift's infamous title as a ""snake"" during her hiatus[64] was also represented when a snake slithers onto the throne to serve Swift some tea. When Swift's car crashes, some speculated that it may be a jab at Katy Perry, as Swift's hairdo is similar to Perry's in the scene and the car crash resembles one in Perry's music video for ""Unconditionally"" (2013). The sports car is also reminiscent of a car in Perry's ""Waking Up in Vegas"" (2009) video, which Kahn also directed. However, given the theme of making fun of the media, it is likely making fun of the media theory that Swift's real fall-out with Perry was simply for publicity and album material. Swift is mocking the idea that she would damage her friendships for the sake of her business, with the car crash being a metaphor for the fall out between her and Perry and her holding the Grammy Award after the crash within sight of the photographers' cameras referring to the song inspired by their feud winning awards, which the media claimed was Swift's ulterior motive. Swift's withdrawal of her entire music catalog from streaming services and the media theory that she was truly doing this to start her own streaming company were hinted when Swift and her crew robbed a streaming company in the video.[65][66]  Swift gathering at ""Squad U"" was also said to be a reply to the media dubbing her close ""squad"" friends as artificial.[60] During the second chorus, Swift can be seen with eight men, each of which revealed an ""I Heart TS"" crop top after unbuttoning a jacket on her commands. This scene is mocking the idea that Swift forced her then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston to wear an ""I Heart TS"" tank top when they were a couple. Swift was also seen standing on a pile of clones of herself from the past, reiterating the idea that she is leaving her past self behind and mocking the idea that she was not genuine during these phases of her life. The shirt that her ""You Belong with Me"" clone wears is slightly different from the one in the original music video, with her close friends' names scribbled on it this time.[65][66]  In June 2016, discussing the relationship between her and Kanye West after West's song ""Famous"" (2016) was released, Swift wrote on Instagram, ""I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.""[67] The same line is spoken by the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Taylor clone at the end of the video.[68][69] She is wearing the same outfit Swift had worn during the actual 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West interrupted her award-winning speech for Best Female Video.[70]  Live performances [ edit ]  Swift performed ""Look What You Made Me Do"" live for the first time as part of the KIIS-FM's Jingle Ball 2017 on December 1, 2017 in Inglewood, California.[71] Two days later, Swift returned onstage to perform the song again as part of 99.7 Now!'s Poptopia in San Jose, California with the same setlist.[72] The next week Swift sang the song on three other occasions; the B96 Chicago and Pepsi Jingle Bash 2017 in Chicago, the Z100 Jingle Ball 2017 in New York City and Jingle Bell Ball 2017 in London.[73][74][75]  The song is also a regular part of her setlist for the Reputation Stadium Tour, with a tilted throne and golden snakes; while there are snakes on the high screen in the back during the part, ""I don't trust nobody and nobody trust me, I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams"", a big cobra floating appears on stage with the line from the bridge announcing the death of the ""Old Taylor"" spoken by comedian Tiffany Haddish.[76][77]  Accolades [ edit ]  Usage in media [ edit ]  ABC used the song in a promotional video for its Shonda Rhimes' Thursday line-up an hour after its release.[88] Sister network ESPN used it in its college football telecast advertisements for the season opening game between Alabama and Florida State, which was aired on ABC on September 2 along with her other song ""...Ready for It?"".[89] In the South Park episode ""Moss Piglets"" the water-bears in Timmy and Jimmy's experiment for the science fair dance to the song in response to Swift's singing.

"Iowa’s golden girl, Shawn Johnson, revealed she recently suffered a miscarriage in a heartbreaking and emotional video posted Saturday on YouTube.    The 25-year-old former gymnast, who represented the United States at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and came home with a gold and three silver medals, decided to share the video because “we felt like a lot of people go through this.”    The nearly 21-minute video starts off with Johnson crying tears of joy and revealing that she is pregnant.    Her husband, former NFL player Andrew East, tells his future unborn child, “If you are on the way, I love you. I have no idea who you are, what you are, or what you’ll be like, but I’m pumped to meet you.”    Johnson gives her husband a pair of Converse baby sneakers and tells him that she is pregnant before they give each other a big hug.    But then came the news no expectant mother ever wants to hear.  Advertisement  After she experienced bleeding, Johnson went to the doctor’s office, where the doctor confirmed the “Dancing with the Stars” winner was miscarrying but that it’s not her fault.    “So, it’s been a roller coaster of a few days. We just got back from the doctor and I’m no longer pregnant. Somehow, I lost the pregnancy already. It sucks. It’s definitely no fun, guys … and having a doctor confirm that we miscarried doesn’t feel good,” Johnson said in the video. “I’ve cried enough today, I don’t need to cry anymore.”    Johnson uploaded the video Saturday morning, and it’s already been seen more than 100,000 times as of late Saturday afternoon.  In the caption, she wrote: “The past 48 hours have been some of the happiest, scariest, and saddest times of my life.  My husband Andrew and I found out that we were unexpectedly pregnant, only to find out hours later some tragic news. I have been crying more than I ever have, but am still optimistic for what is next.”  AlertMe",1
"Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don’t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the “most corrupt and dishonest” media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.Together, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.It is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial – such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year’s inaugural.But many untruths are not at all trivial – such as the seminal untruth of the president’s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate – to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all – the supposed “hoax” at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.To be very clear, to call the Russia matter a “hoax” – as the president has many times – is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth – so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.Mr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.Mr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.But a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:“In February…Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, “You can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.”In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being “demonized” by “fake news.” Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote “laughing by his side” Duterte called reporters “spies.”In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had “spread lots of false versions, lots of lies” about his country, adding, “This is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?”There are more:“A state official in Myanmar recently said, “There is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,” referring to the persecuted ethnic group.Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised “fake news” legislation in the new year.”And on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.We are not in a “fake news” era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, “The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.”Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press’s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people’s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:“We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.”Mr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.We are a mature democracy – it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring – or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: ""What is truth?"" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled “Oh Say, What is Truth.” It ends as follows:“Then say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,For the limits of time it steps o'er.Tho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,Eternal… unchanged… evermore.”Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.This article tagged under: Donald TrumpJeff Flake",0
"“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is currently Broadway’s hottest ticket. One person who won’t be lucky enough to score a ticket? President Donald Trump.  “No,” Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione, said when asked if Trump should see the show. “Anybody else, yes.”  Even though the play itself is not overtly political, Harry Potter fans have drawn comparisons between Trump and the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort, since the 2016 presidential election.  “I really do believe that’s why it’s resonating at the moment,” Dumezweni said on the red carpet at the Tony Awards. “We, all as human beings, are fighting to be connected. If you’re not seen and not heard, that’s where dangerous stuff happens. That’s where people under the radar do very cruel things.”  The two-part stage play, based on J.K. Rowling’s boy wizard Harry Potter, is set 19 years after the events of the seventh book installment, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.”  That’s what this play is about,” Dumezweni said. “It’s about bringing things into the light. Letting your light shine. This is what J.K. has always been about. Let the darkness out into the light. That’s why i’m very proud to be here telling this story right now. Those things are very important.”  “Cursed Child” is up for 10 Tonys, including best play, best performance by an actor, and best performance by an actress.  RELATED VIDEO:",0
"Black Mirror’s “USS Callister” won three Emmy awards Saturday and there could potentially be more in its future—if the episode becomes a series.  “Never say never,” creator and executive producer Charlie Brooker said about continuing the story of the episode’s characters, Variety reported Saturday. “The opposite of never,” executive producer Annabel Jones added. “Forever!”  The episode won Emmys for outstanding TV movie, picture editing and sound editing. Black Mirror also won the award for outstanding TV movie for “San Junipero” in 2017.  In “USS Callister,” Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) is the chief technical officer of a gaming company who is the starship captain in a virtual reality world. Digital clones of his real-life coworkers make up the virtual crew of the ship. While he’s bossed around in real life, he’s the one in charge in his video game.  The episode also stars Cristin Milioti as a coworker who leads a rebellion against Daly in the virtual world and destroys the DNA samples he has of his coworkers in his apartment in the real world. Jimmi Simpson plays Daly’s real-life boss.  The potential of the story to continue was also addressed when Netflix first released the episode. “I was talking with Louise Sutton, who produced this and ‘Metalhead,’ and she cooked up the brilliant idea of spinning it off into a TV series,” director Toby Haynes told The Hollywood Reporter in January. “I’d love to do a TV series of ‘USS Callister’—it’s probably one of the best pilots for a space show ever. … I think Charlie [Brooker] might revisit it as a Black Mirror.”  While the episode ended with Daly defeated in and unable to leave the virtual reality, its director wouldn’t rule out seeing Plemons if there is a series or sequel. “That’s the fun of it, isn’t it? That’s what this idea is,” Haynes said to the publication. “There is this brilliant idea that he is still alive, and his attempted murder gets pinned on someone. Whose fingerprints do they find in the apartment? There’s so much you could do.”  Jonathan Prime / Netflix  Milioti would like to reprise her role and explore that point from Haynes. “If this were ever a spinoff, in the fake world she would be kicking ass and battling aliens,” she told THR in December. “And then there is the real world where her prints have been found inside Daly’s apartment. He’s dead in his apartment and she has to figure that out.”",1
"The Golden Globes are known for switching things up compared to other award shows, but that wasn't the case when Sterling K. Brown won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama for his role as Randall Pearson on This Is Us. Brown beat out Jason Bateman for Ozark, Freddie Highmore for The Good Doctor, Bob Odenkirk — Better Call Saul, and Liev Schreiber for Ray Donovan. And just like Brown doesn't disappoint week to week on This Is Us, he's also proving himself a force to be reckoned with when it comes to awards show speeches.  Brown was the most obvious choice to win the Best Actor in a TV Drama award, considering in September, he won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. That win made Brown the first black man to take home the award in 19 years. That said, it wouldn't have been a huge surprise if the Globes had chosen a wild card. As Entertainment Weekly noted in their predictions, ""The HFPA loves to honor members of the freshman class,"" which made EW think Highmore was going to win. TV Guide also predicted a win for Highmore, explaining that the category was a ""toss-up"" between him and Brown, but that a win for Highmore on The Good Doctor would be a shout-out to the new show. Meanwhile, TIME predicted Brown's win, noting that he was a sure bet and that the ""HFPA overlooked him last year when he was nominated for The People v. O.J. Simpson.""  Brown gave a funny and emotional speech when he won his Emmy, but it also got a lot of attention because he was cut off before he was finished speaking. Now, Brown has made up for that with his Golden Globes' speech, only four months later. This win was also a historic one for the actor; it made him the first black TV drama actor winner.  He started the speech by simply saying, ""Oprah..."" I mean, she was right there in the audience, after all, and who wouldn't be stunned by the Oprah Winfrey? He soon continued on, though, and made a reference to his Emmy's speech being cut off when he said, ""I don't want to run out of time, so let me thank my wife.”  Brown then went on to thank his kids — ""I will take you to school in the morning, I promise,"" he told them — as well as NBC and his co-stars. But then, things took a more serious turn when he began to thank This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman.  Brown first talked about how he has benefitted from ""colorblind casting"" throughout his career in parts where they would just ""throw a brother in this role."" But what he appreciates about playing Randall, the character Fogelman created, is that it isn't colorblind at all.  ""Dan Fogelman, you wrote a role for a black man that could only be played by a black man,"" Brown said. ""And so, what I appreciate so much about this thing is I am being seen for who I am. I am being appreciated for who I am. And it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or to dismiss anybody who looks like me. So thank you, Dan. Thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press.""  In addition to Brown's nomination for This Is Us, the show was also nominated in two other categories: Best TV Drama Series, which it lost to The Handmaid's Tale; and Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture for TV for Chrissy Metz, who plays Randall's sister, Kate, on the series, and who lost out to Laura Dern for Big Little Lies.",1

"One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's ""no ring, no bring"" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the ""no ring no bring"" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.",0
"Bill O’Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were “disgusted” by his behavior towards women at Fox News. O’Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That’s when the “tolerant” liberals got violent.One of the men grabbed O’Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.O’Reilly was taken to St. Vincent’s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O’Reilly’s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.The family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O’Reilly “got what he deserved” for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.Liberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don’t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be “tortured,” but it’s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he’s done.Liberalism is truly a mental disorder.",0

"Kristen Mary Jenner (née Houghton HOH-tən, formerly Kardashian; born November 5, 1955)[1] is an American television personality, entertainment manager, producer, businesswoman, and author. She rose to fame starring in the reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–present).  She has four children from her first marriage to lawyer Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert, and two children from her second marriage to television personality and retired Olympic Games medalist, Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn): Kendall and Kylie.  Early life [ edit ]  Jenner was born in San Diego, California. She is the first child of Mary Jo Shannon (née Campbell; born 1934) and Robert True Houghton,[2][3] an engineer.[4][5] She is of Dutch, English, Irish, German and Scottish descent. When Jenner was seven years old, her parents divorced and she and her younger sister, Karen, were raised by their mother until a few years later when her mother married businessman Harry Shannon.  Three months after moving to Oxnard, California, Shannon's business partner allegedly left with all the company's capital, so the family moved back to San Diego.[6] Jenner attended Clairemont High School[7] and graduated in 1973.[8] She worked as a flight attendant for a year in 1976.[9]  Career [ edit ]  Jenner runs her own production company, Jenner Communications, which is based in Los Angeles. Since the start of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, she has managed her daughter Kim's career. She also is involved with the business management of her other daughters and son.  Jenner opened a children's boutique in 2004 with her eldest daughter, Kourtney . The boutique was called ""Smooch"" and was open for almost six years before closing down in 2009.[10][11]  Writing [ edit ]  Jenner's autobiography, Kris Jenner... and All Things Kardashian, was released in November 2011.[12] She later wrote a cookbook entitled In the Kitchen with Kris: A Kollection of Kardashian-Jenner Family Favorites, which was released in October 2014.[13]  Television show [ edit ]  Jenner hosted a pop culture-driven daytime talk show, Kris. The series began its six-week trial summer run on several Fox-owned stations on July 15, 2013.[14]  Kanye West, her son-in-law, revealed the first public picture of daughter North West on the show. The show's six-week trial run was not extended.[15]  Keeping Up with the Kardashians [ edit ]  Jenner met with Ryan Seacrest in 2007 to pursue a reality television show based on her family. Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in his mind. Jenner further commented on the possible series:[16]  “ Like, there's the little girls, and there's the older girls, and then there's my son. [...] Everybody thinks that they could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural. ”  The show eventually was picked up to air on the E! cable network with Jenner acting as the executive producer. The series focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended families.[10] The series debuted on October 14, 2007, and has later become one of the longest-running reality television shows in the country.[17] The twelfth season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians started airing on May 1, 2016.[18] The show has resulted in the development of several spin-offs, such as Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami (2009), Kourtney and Kim Take New York (2011), Khloé & Lamar (2011), Rob & Chyna (2016) and Life of Kylie (2017)[19]  Personal life [ edit ]  Kris Jenner in 2010  Marriages, relationships, and family [ edit ]  Jenner's first marriage was to lawyer Robert Kardashian (who later became widely known for his early legal representation of O. J. Simpson) on July 8, 1978.[20][21] They have four children: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), Khloé (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). They divorced in March 1991, but remained close friends until his death from esophageal cancer in 2003.[22]  In 2012, Kris confessed that she had an affair with former soccer player and animator Todd Waterman during her marriage to Kardashian. She referred to Waterman as ""Ryan"" in her autobiography, but he revealed his identity on his own. They had an encounter on Keeping up with the Kardashians while Kris was having a tennis lesson.[23]  In April 1991, one month after her divorce from Kardashian, Jenner married her second spouse, retired Olympian Bruce Jenner, who publicly came out as a transgender woman in 2015, taking the name Caitlyn.[24] They have two daughters together: Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997);[25] in her autobiography, Jenner explained that she named her daughter Kendall Nicole after the late Nicole Brown Simpson.[26] By marriage to Bruce, Kris also had four stepchildren: Burt, Cassandra ""Casey"", Brandon and Brody.  The Jenners announced their separation in October 2013,[27][28] and on September 22, 2014, she filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[29] The divorce became final on March 23, 2015, because of a six-month state legal requirement.[30][31] Kris Jenner has talked about the breakup with Caitlyn as ""the most passive-aggressive thing"", saying that while she had known of her use of hormones in the 1980s, ""there wasn't a gender issue. Nobody mentioned a gender issue.""[32] Through her children, Jenner has nine grandchildren.[33]  O. J. Simpson trial [ edit ]  Jenner and her family suffered emotional turmoil during the O. J. Simpson trial (1994-1995), later described as the ""Trial of the Century."" Jenner was a good friend of O.J.'s ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and Jenner's first husband, Robert Kardashian, was one of O.J. Simpson's ""Dream Team"" of defense lawyers during the trial.[34]  She was portrayed by American actress Selma Blair in the FX limited series American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson, which premiered in February 2016.[35]  California Community Church [ edit ]  Jenner and Pastor Brad Johnson founded the California Community Church in 2012. It originally was called the Life Change Community Church, located in Agoura Hills, California.[36]  Plastic surgery [ edit ]  In June 2011, Jenner had a face lift months before her daughter Kim's wedding to Kris Humphries and allowed the preparations and recovery from the surgery to be recorded. The video footage can be seen on E! Online and ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding Part 1"" episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. She explained: ""I needed a little freshening up for the wedding. Just doing what a girl's gotta do!""[37] Jenner also had an earlobe reduction which was revealed in an episode of KUWTK that premiered in January of 2018.",0
"With a baby on the way, Kim Kardashian & Kanye West have reportedly been fighting more than ever — especially because Kim insists the birth be filmed for TV!  Kim Kardashian, 37, has already admitted that having a surrogate carry her and Kanye West‘s, 40, third child is “so much harder” than personally being pregnant. And it seems Kanye isn’t making things any easier for the reality star. In fact, a new report from InTouch Weekly claims the couple has been fighting constantly in the weeks leading up to their daughter’s arrival, and it’s driving Kim nuts. Their main source of tension? The mag claims Kim wants to film their child’s birth for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, while Kanye is totally against it. Click here to see adorable pics of the Kardashian kids.  “They’re at loggerheads about the birth being filmed for Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” an insider for the publication told the mag. “Kanye’s made it clear that cameras are banned from the delivery room.” On top of that, Kanye reportedly doesn’t even want Kris Jenner, 62, to be there either — apparently he wants to keep things super private and intimate! Kim, on the other hand, is not having any of it. “Kim’s insisting that Kris be by her side, and is trying to convince Kanye that filming it will increase their popularity and the show’s ratings,” the source added.  As of yet though, the two apparently have not come to an agreement. Instead they’ve “been arguing nonstop,” the source said. “It’s driving Kim crazy.” As a reminder, Kim and Kanye did NOT film the births of North West, 4, or Saint West, 2, for the show, so we can’t imagine this new baby’s grand entrance will be any different. Something that is different though, is the fact that the family had to use a surrogate this time around, as doctors advised Kim not to give birth for a third time. And while Kim’s said in the past that she and her surrogate get along, InTouch‘s report also claims the tide has shifted, and now the surrogate doesn’t even want Kim in the delivery room when she gives birth!  “There will be major tension between them in the delivery room,” a second source told the publication. “The surrogate doesn’t even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice. Everyone is fearful a fight could break out between them!” Yikes! Now THAT would be interesting to catch on tape for KUWTK!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do you think Kim and Kanye’s baby’s birth will end up being filmed for TV?",0
"The 2018 MTV Video Music Awards are going solo.  Monday night’s show will air without a proper host, a representative for MTV confirmed. It’s not the first time the VMAs opted out of a traditional emcee. Katy Perry took over the reigns last year after a similarly hostless show in 2016. Back in 2011, a series of high-profile presenters stepped in to steer the program (Remember Lady Gaga as the iconic Jo Calderone?).  Luckily, Jennifer Lopez won’t have to worry about handing herself the Video Vanguard Award (although, given her work ethic, she’d find a way). The list of VMAs’ presenters includes Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart, Millie Bobby Brown and Amandla Stenberg.  This year, Cardi B leads the way with 10 nominations, followed by music royalty Jay-Z and Beyoncé with eight nominations for their video “APES**T.” Childish Gambino is a close third with seven nominations. The VMAs are back in New York for the first time in nine years at Radio City Music Hall.  The show airs Monday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on MTV.",1
"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.",0
"At 91 years old, Queen Elizabeth II has a laundry list of accolades to her name, including the world’s longest-ruling and oldest monarch. She’s also the richest member of the British royal family — by a long shot.  Royal family finances can be complicated, as many details of their fortune are kept private. But it’s fair to say that Queen Elizabeth and the royal family’s net worth is in the tens of billions — around $88 billion as of 2017, according to Forbes. Since the royal family’s jobs aren’t like the average person, how do they make all their money? The short answer: much of the royal family lives off trusts like the Crown Estate, which is owned by the reigning monarch and includes real estate properties like Buckingham Palace.  Some of the royal family’s wealth also comes from a portfolio of extravagant personal collections. The British monarchy owns billions of dollars in property alone, including Balmoral Castle, where the Queen spends every summer, The Savoy in London, a horse racetrack and an entire London street. The crown also owns one of the largest art collections in the world and the Crown Jewels collection, which is made up of more than 140 individual pieces and estimated to be worth at least $4 billion.  Royal obsession, which neared fever pitch this spring as the world prepared for the arrival of Kate Middleton’s third baby, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, and the marriage of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is thought to generate approximately £1.8 billion, or about $2.5 billion, for the U.K. economy every year. (That number is likely even higher this year because of Prince Harry and Meghan’s May wedding.)  Here’s what you need to know about each member of the royal family’s net worth:  Queen Elizabeth II net worth  Queen Elizabeth II visits the Royal College Of Physicians on February 20, 2018 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Queen Elizabeth II enjoys a number of royal perks — particularly her substantial wealth. The 91-year-old Queen Elizabeth’s net worth is estimated to be at least $520 million by Wealth-X, a global wealth insights firm. The firm also estimated the royal family’s net worth (Prince Philip and their children) to land at least $1.1 billion.  The queen’s net worth comes in part from a percentage of profits generated by the Crown Estate, which earned about £328.8 million pounds, or $459.25 million, in the 2016-2017 calendar year, according to its annual report. Queen Elizabeth gets a percentage of that profit — called the “Sovereign Grant” — which is set to increase from 15% to 25% over the next 10 years, in part to pay for renovations at Buckingham Palace that will be completed over the next decade. The queen also collects a salary from the Duchy of Lancaster, which is separate from the Crown Estate and is a private and independent income reserved for the Duke of Lancaster, which is the queen.  Queen Elizabeth also owns real estate like the $140 million Balmoral Castle, a holiday home for the Royal Family that is featured on the back of Scotland’s £100 notes, and the $65 million Sandringham House in the English countryside, which the Queen inherited from her father. Both of these are private properties that have stayed within the Royal Family for years and are not part of the Crown Estate or other estates associated with the crown.  Prince Philip net worth  Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh attends the 2017 Braemar Highland Gathering at The Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park on September 2, 2017 in Braemar, Scotland. Samir Hussein—Samir Hussein/WireImage Samir Hussein—Samir Hussein/WireImage  Prince Philip — Queen Elizabeth’s husband of 70 years and the Duke of Edinburgh — also enjoys the wealth and perks that come with being a member of the royal family. While WealthX did not provide a net worth for Prince Philip, it has been reported it falls around $30 million.  Under the Sovereign Grant Act of 2011, Prince Philip received an annual Parliamentary annuity of £359,000 pounds, or around $500,234, “to meet the expenses of carrying out his public duties in support of the Queen.” Those duties included attending public events alongside the queen and alone, as well as giving speeches. At an event in March 2016, Prince Philip once joked he was the “world’s most expensive plaque-unveiler.”  The Duke of Edinburgh retired from his royal position in August 2017 at the age of 96, with the “full support of the Queen,” the palace said in a statement at the time. His retirement from the role came after he was admitted to the hospital in the summer of 2017 as a “precautionary measure” due to a pre-existing condition, though Buckingham Palace did not provide specifics for his retirement.  Prince Charles net worth  Prince Charles, Prince of Wales meets local school children in the village of Ramsbury on December 15, 2017 in Marlborough, England. Anwar Hussein—WireImage Anwar Hussein—WireImage  Long the heir to the throne, Prince Charles’s net worth is estimated to be around $400 million, according to Wealth-X. Charles, also known as the Prince of Wales, makes most of his money through the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the activities of whoever holds the title of Prince of Wales and his family.  Between March 2016 to March 2017, Prince Charles received £16.6 million, or $22.9 million, from the Duchy of Cornwall, according to the estate’s most recent financial statement. The Duchy of Cornwall has £1 billion, or $1.3 billion, in total assets. The estate itself owns a vast amount of land and real estate, predominately in southwest England, including cottages, countryside homes, barn conversions, sea-side estates and even some properties available for rent.  The Duchy of Cornwall was established in 1337 by Edward II with the intention of providing an income to the future Princes of Wales. The estate currently funds not only Prince Charles’ expenses but also those of his family, which includes Prince Charles, his wife Camilla, and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry and their wives Kate, Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.  Once married to the late Princess Diana, mother to both Prince William and Prince Harry, Prince Charles has donated his wealth over the years to charities and aid projects through the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation. The organization has awarded more than £52 million, or $72.5 million, in grants over the last 10 years, according to the charity’s website. Prince Charles’s charity halved its donations in the most recently reported year, giving £3.1 million, or $4.3 million, in 2017, compared to £7.7 million, or $10.7 million, in 2016, according to The Guardian.  One of the most recent beneficiaries of the foundation was Tusk, an organization founded to challenge poaching in Africa, which Prince William and Prince Harry worked with before.  Prince William net worth  Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, at the 2018 Centrepoint Awards at Kensington Palace on February 8, 2018 in London, England. WPA Pool—Getty Images WPA Pool—Getty Images  Prince William and Prince Harry have similar net worths, having both inherited the fortune amassed by their late mother, Princess Diana. Both brothers are believed to be worth somewhere between $25 and $40 million, according to Business Insider.  The two brothers each reportedly received the inheritance from their mother in a lump sum of approximately £10 million ($14 million) when they turned 30 years old, Koenig said. They also each started receiving dividends of $450,000 each year upon turning 25, according to Forbes.  William and Harry do not have to pay for official expenses related to their royal duties, such as travel for official visits, staff costs and wardrobe, which are are all financed by The Duchy of Cornwall. In 2017, the Duchy reported spending $4.9 million total to cover the official duties of Harry, Meghan, William and Kate, expenses that are paid in part through the Duchy’s annual revenue.  Prince William, who is second in line to the throne after his father, used to receive an annual salary of $62,000 for his work as an East Anglian Air Ambulance pilot, which he used to donate to charity, according to CNBC. He retired from his job flying rescue helicopters last summer to focus more on his royal duties.  Prince Harry net worth  Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex wave as they leave Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House, hosted by the Prince of Wales on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Prince Harry’s net worth is similar to his brother’s, in part because they both inherited the same amount of money from Princess Diana’s estate. Harry’s wealth is estimated to be at least $25 million, according to Wealth-X, though other estimates put Prince Harry’s net worth as high as $40 million.  Like his brother and sister-in-law, Prince Harry gets to save the majority of his inheritance because The Duchy of Cornwall covers the same expenses. Both Prince Harry and Prince William also inherited Princess Diana’s private jewels, though their value is not known, according to Koenig.  Prince Harry served in the Royal Air Force for 10 years, working his way up to captain, and making about $53,000 a year, Forbes reports. He retired from service in 2015, saying he wanted to devote more time to philanthropic work like the Invictus Games, which hosts international adaptive sports competitions for injured veterans.  He wed American actress Meghan Markle in May at Windsor Castle, and experts estimated their wedding cost about as much Will and Kate’s 2011 nuptials — around $34 million, mainly due to the security needed for the high-profile event.  Kate Middleton net worth  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, greets members of the crowd as she visits The Fire Station, one of Sunderland's most iconic buildings, on February 21, 2018 in Sunderland, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Kate Middleton, who became the Duchess of Cambridge after marrying Prince William in April 2011, also has official royal expenses covered by the Duchy of Cornwall. Kate’s personal net worth is believed to be somewhere around $10 million, Business Insider reported, though the exact number is not known.  Although Kate is the first person outside a royal bloodline to join the royal family, her finances are anything but common. Middleton’s family runs a successful online mail-order party supply store, Party Pieces. Koenig says her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, have been reported to be worth somewhere between $30 to $50 million, though the exact amount is not known.  “There is no way in knowing if the Duchess’ parents have set up trusts for their three children,” she said. But we can assume that Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, will inherit their parents money eventually, she said.  Kate has three children with William — Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, and Prince Louis, a boy who was born on April 23.  Meghan Markle net worth  Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex travel in the Ascot Landau Carriage during their carriage procession after their wedding on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Among the guests were 2200 members of the public, the royal family and Ms. Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland. Nick Edwards - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Meghan Markle, who became the Duchess of Sussex after marrying Prince Harry this year, may have the smallest bank account of her new (royal) family, but she’s still done well for herself with an estimated net worth of $5 million.  Most of Meghan’s net worth comes from her acting career before her 2017 engagement to Prince Harry. Meghan was paid $50,000 per episode on Suits, making her annual salary for the USA Network drama around $450,000, according to Fortune, but she left the show when she moved to the U.K. to live with Prince Harry. Meghan earned additional income from smaller film roles throughout her acting career.  The 36-year-old former Suits actress receives the same financial perks as her new sister-in-law, Kate. Meghan’s expenses related to all official royal business, including wardrobe, are paid for by the Duchy of Cornwall.  Despite only being married in May, Meghan has already joined Prince Harry for numerous royal engagements and begun her official royal duties. She has said she wants to dive into charity work through the Royal Foundation, having previously worked on United Nations campaigns for women’s rights.  Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis net worths  Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Prince George of Cambridge look on from the balcony during the annual Trooping The Colour parade at the Mall on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Karwai Tang—WireImage Karwai Tang—WireImage  At just 4, 2 and less than a year old Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are destined for a life of wealth and royalty.  Prince William and Kate Middleton’s first two children both already have relatively lavish lives — they attend two of the most impressive, and expensive, preschools in London. Prince George, who is third in line for the throne, attends Thomas’s Battersea — a $24,000-a-year- preschool that is touted as “the best English education money can buy.” Fourth in line for the throne, Princess Charlotte goes to the Willcocks Nursery School, a female-run preschool with a $14,000-a-year tuition.  Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have a large impact on the British economy, according to branding valuation company Brand Finance, CNNMoney reported. Princess Charlotte is expected to have inspired $5 billion in economic activity while Prince George is expected to generate $3.6 billion, according to Brand Finance. Prince Louis is expected to generate a bit less than his older siblings, somewhere between $70-125 million within the first few weeks of his life, according to U.K-based research firms.

"She Is Cait. The first episode for Caitlyn Jenner's brand-new E! docuseries, I Am Cait, shows the former Olympian continually moving along in her transition from male to female, with the support of close friends and her famous family members.  Us Weekly rounds up the top five moments from the premiere, screened to press in NYC and L.A., on Tuesday, July 21, including revelations like Caitlyn's friendship with Kris' former best friend Ronda Kamihira, her mom's reaction to her debut as a woman, as well as Kanye West's thoughts on her societal impact.  PHOTOS: Caitlyn Jenner's journey through the years  1. Who Is Ronda Kamihira?  After Caitlyn (previously known as Bruce) finalized her divorce last fall, the former decathlete stepped out with her ex's longtime best friend and former assistant Ronda Kamihira — and it was rumored that they were dating. A source told Us at the time that while Kamihira and Caitlyn attended an Elton John concert together, joined by Brandon and Leah Jenner last October, it was unclear whether they were actually a couple.  In the debut episode, Kamihira's relationship with Caitlyn is fully revealed, and it's not romantic at all. She is introduced as Caitlyn's assistant and her close friend, and the two share a surprising bond. Caitlyn says in her docuseries that she began confiding in Ronda about transitioning close to two years ago. Ronda even helped her pick the name ""Caitlyn.""  PHOTOS: Celebs' coming out stories  2. Esther Jenner Meets Caitlyn for the First Time Ever  Esther Jenner — Kylie, Kendall, Brandon, and Brody's maternal grandmother — has continually voiced her public support for Caitlyn, even prior to the star's sit-down interview with Diane Sawyer, during which the athlete confirmed, ""For all intents and purposes, I am a woman.""  In the first few scenes of I Am Cait's premiere, Caitlyn is seen nervously pacing at home, because her sisters and her mother are on their way over. This is the first time the family has been all together in a whopping four years, and Caitlyn is fretting because Esther has yet to meet Cait. She wonders how she should sign her mother's birthday card — as Bruce or as Caitlyn? (Spoiler alert: She ends up signing it as Caitlyn).  When the family arrives, Cait says to her mom, ""It's okay, it's okay."" Esther replied, ""I knew it would be,"" as the entire clan hugs in the entryway. In her one-off with the camera, the Jenner family matriarch has sweet notes about Cait's new appearance. ""I think he's a very good looking woman,"" Esther muses. ""He's still Bruce. I love him so much."" While making an effort, she admits that the transition will require ""a lot of getting used to."" They also meet with a therapist, who helps facilitate a larger conversation with the family. ""I really want to learn more,"" Esther repeats throughout the episode. ""I need to understand more""  In another scene, Caitlyn's mom tears up as she discusses how ""it's not easy"" getting used to the newfound identity of her child. The supportive mom gets visibly emotional. ""You have the same soul you were born with,"" she notes to Cait.  PHOTOS: Kardashian Christmas cards through the years  3. Kylie Sees Caitlyn for the First Time Ever — Via FaceTime!  Caitlyn's youngest daughter Kylie, 17, sees her for the first time ever as a woman via FaceTime. The teen, who graduated from high school this past week, is waking up from anesthesia in a dentist's chair when she sees Cait in her female form. ""You look so pretty!"" Kylie gushes, still slightly out of it from her operation.  Later, Kylie comes over to see her in person and puts teal ombre hair extensions (from her own line, ha!) in Cait's hair. Kendall's younger sister says she was Google-imaging snapshots to figure out the best color scheme.  After Kylie leaves, Cait expresses how excited she is about her daughter being accepting and gracious. Cait tells her sister that Kylie never really wanted to come by before, and she's glad that she finally did.  PHOTOS: How Kylie has evolved  4. Kim and Kanye Make a Brief and Memorable Cameo  The superstar couple's brief appearance in the premiere is marked with their usual antics — Kanye West gives a very sincere and philosophical statement, while stepdaughter Kim Kardashian pulls some tricks in the closet.  ""What's up,"" the rapper says to Caitlyn as he gives her a hug. West then tells Cait that she's ""changing society in the most meaningful way,"" adding that what the former Olympian did was ""one of the strongest things that have happened"" in her entire lifetime. ""You're a celebrity, your daughter is a supermodel, and you're saying this is who I am.""  Meanwhile, Kim brings some comic relief to the episode as she raids Cait's closet and sifts through her newly revamped wardrobe. The Vogue cover girl largely approves most of the items in Cait's closet with the exception of one maxi dress. Caitlyn has a lot of items from Diane von Furstenberg and Tom Ford that the designers themselves have sent over directly.  ""I love this Tom Ford dress,"" Cait tells North West's mom. Kim then notes that Kris has the same Tom Ford dress in a different color. The two joke about setting the momager up for a ""Who Wore It Best"" (shout-out to Us Weekly!). Kim jokes that she'll invite Cait over when Kris is in the dress.  PHOTOS: Caitlyn Jenner's best style moments — so far!  5.

Together, the group releases memorial balloons on the beach in San Diego.  BONUS!  The previews for the second episode include several juicy tidbits, including one scene where Candis Cayne asks Cait if she wants to go on a date.

"Are you a Fifth Harmony super fan? Do you think you know everything there is to know about each of the members? I bet you do, but if you want to go beyond as a super fan, you need to expand your knowledge past the singers in Fifth Harmony. A real fan makes it a point to know about their favorite band's inner circle and family members. For starters, does Fifth Harmony's Camila Cabello have any siblings?  If you are a genuine fan, you probably already know the answer to that question, but it can't hurt to learn more about Camila and her fam. And if you don't know, Camila has an adorable 7-year-old sister named Sofia. The younger Cabello has just as much spunk and sass as her older sister. In fact, Sofia seems to be a budding star herself. She loves to sing and dance just like her older sister.  Even though she is only seven, videos of Sofia Cabello probably have more views than anything you've ever posted online. Maybe the girls should change the name of the band from Fifth Harmony to Sixth Harmony? Check out the cuteness that is Sofia Cabello.  She Looks Just like Her Sister  How cute is she!?

"Every Thursday, BravoTV.com digital producers Megan Segura and Rachael Roberts are bringing you exclusive interviews with Bravolebs like Vicki Gunvalson, NeNe Leakes, and Stassi Schroeder, plus expert commentary and behind-the-scenes secrets straight from Bravo execs. Listen, like, and subscribe to The Daily Dish on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Play, and make yourself part of the conversation by tweeting us @Bravotv with the hashtag #BravoDailyDish.  Fans saw LeeAnne Locken get engaged to her longtime love Rich Emberlin on Season 2 of The Real Housewives of Dallas and Season 3 began with the couple being toasted at D'Andra Simmons' anniversary party. D'Andra dared the two to get married right then and there, but the couple demurred. Previews for this season show the Dallas ladies discussing LeeAnne's relationship and wondering why she and Rich haven't set a date. Given that LeeAnne's engagement happened on cameras, fans have been wondering if their wedding will be a part of RHOD as well.  ""I have always said that I would share it with our audience because I feel like I've taken them down the journey of watching me get engaged on camera,"" LeeAnne told The Daily Dish podcast. ""A lot of people were like, 'You planned that!' I'm like, 'Sweetie, that was the one and only time he was ever asked me with a ring was then. I mean, what you saw was the first time that he's ever asked me. That was his real moment and my real moment. And that was our real joy. And I really wanted to share that with our audience. So, yeah, I'm going to share my wedding with our audience.""  In fact, LeeAnne wants the cameras there to capture all of the intimate moments of the day — and it doesn't sound like anything is off-limits. ""The wedding is a ceremony that I think people should get to enjoy. I mean, I want you to see if I get nervous or, God forbid, I trip in my wedding dress or my flowers die in my hands as I'm walking down the street or lightning strikes me and whole church burns up. I want to share all that,"" she laughed.  Given the special occasion, The Daily Dish podcast asked if Rich would be jazzing up his eye patch, which he has worn ever since sustaining damage to one eye.  ""No, I will not bling him a patch, people. Come on now,"" LeeAnne said. ""Every single one of my friends is like, 'I'll bling that for you. You want me to put some rhinestones on that patch?' I'm like, ""Y'all, it's not an accessory. Losing your vision is not an accessory; it's a tragedy.""  It sounds like Rich will be making his wedding day ensemble decisions all on his own: ""I don't have to drag him everywhere and tell him what to dress and how to dress and all that. I let him do him. And then every night, I let him do me,"" she joked.  LeeAnne and Rich's wedding is definitely a hot topic this season. Make sure to tune in to RHOD every Wednesday at 9/8c. Check out a preview of this Wednesday's episode, below.",1
"If any of us brought a guy like Liam Hemsworth home, our parents would be planning a wedding within minutes (or at least, my parents would be). Which is exactly why we are so shocked by what Tish Cyrus has to say about him. Miley Cyrus’s mom doesn’t get the pressure to marry Liam Hemsworth.  Say what?!!  While the rest of the world drools over Miley and Liam’s beautiful relationship, Tish just doesn’t see the big deal. Guess visiting children’s hospitals together and raising a bunch of animals doesn’t warm her heart like it does for us! Regardless of what the rest of the world wants, Tish thinks Miley has plenty of time before she even has to start thinking of marriage.  But don’t get her wrong. Tish totally supports her daughter’s relationship.  She even gave us their relationship update!  Tish Cyrus spoke with Mario Lopez on his radio show on Wednesday, and revealed that Miley and Liam are stronger than ever. But, wedding bells are not in their immediate future.  ""She is not eloping. She is not getting married. They are so freaking happy and living in Malibu,""  Honestly, what else would we want for the power couple that is giving us ultimate #RelationshipGoals?  It seems like Miley and Tish are in agreement about not rushing into a legal binding marriage.  “She’s so happy, and she’s always like, ‘I don’t know why everybody wants us to get married. It’s so perfect.'” You know what they say — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  Regardless — we’re sure shippers will still freak out whenever they see Miley wearing white. Like that one time Miley’s dad Billy Ray Cyrus posted a photo of his daughter wearing white with the caption, “I’m so happy…you are happy @mileycyrus.” Everyone was convinced Billy Ray just witnessed his daughter get married, but that was soo not the case.  Miley’s dad later had to clarify that Miley was NOT getting married, and that he simply was just stating that he’s happy for her. Because, ya know, women can look happy in white dresses without having to get married. Miley is probably enjoying her successful career as a musician — and as she should, girl hustles and works hard.  As long as Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are happy together, how “official” their relationship is shouldn’t matter. We’re just glad to see those two kids back in each other’s lives.",0

She is the youngest daughter of singer and songwriter Lionel Richie and adoptive sister to fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie.

"It was an eyebrow-raising moment she did not try to conceal.  And it has emerged supposed non-smoker Khloe Kardashian was holding a marijuana joint in a recent episode of her clan's television show portraying their holiday in Costa Rica.  In a typically exciting installment of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday, she was shown holding a suspicious-looking cigarette in her hand as she enthusiastically embraced her sister Kourtney's former lover Scott Disick.  No smoke without fire: Khloe Kardashian is said to have been holding a marijuana joint on Sunday's Keeping Up With The Kardashians  According to TMZ, sources close to production said they did not mind the fact the 32-year-old was holding a drug in the scene because it was a natural moment.  In addition, while marijuana is illegal in the United States, it is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica.  However it is hardly the first time the star has caused a stir due to smokling.  For back in 2014 she was photographed puffing away on a suspicious looking cigarette while in a nightclub with her then lover The Game.  However her spokesman claimed at the time: 'She doesn’t smoke pot or cigarettes. It's a Hookah stick, which is tobacco free. It’s called Phantom Smoke.'  Watch the joint: Khloe seemed careful as she went in for a hug with Scott Disick  Carried away: But she seemed to be relishing her clinch with sister Kourtney's former lover  No wonder it's so popular: Marijuana is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica  She was spotted smoking while on the dance floor while getting very close to rapper and self-proclaimed 'weed enthusiast,' whose real name is the rather less flamboyant Jayceon Taylor.  At one point in her exciting evening the classy broad was even seen waving her gargantuan behind at him, Miley Cyrus style.  The 37-year-old rapper recently raised by confirming he had slept with sisters Kim and Khloe, as well as their future sister-in-law Blac Chyna.  Chivalrous Jayceon told Wendy WIlliams after she quizzed him on his single Sauce, where he raps, 'I used to f*** b****s that Usher Raymond passed on, Then I f***ed three Kardashians.'  Sly puff? Perhaps the pair shared the suspicious-looking cigarette later",0
"Great news for Robert Pattinson’s fans. Recent rumors suggest that Twilight alum and FKA Twigs are expecting their first child.  Gamenguide reported earlier that the Remember Me star is currently suffering from depression and that’s why he has canceled his wedding with Twigs. Now the publication has reported about their pregnancy.  According to Gamenguide, there are reports that Robert Pattinson and Tahliah Debrett Barnett are planning to have a baby so they could save their failing relationship. According to the reports, the couple is now very desperate to fix their relationship and that’s why they have decided to have a baby  If these speculations about Kristen’s ex-boyfriend were not enough, other sources previously claimed that the engaged couple might be headed for an end. Hollywood Life reported that Twigs and Pattinson were spotted fighting at Los Angeles Airport. The publication further noted that the couple seemed visibly upset with each other.  At the same time, iTechPost explained that the fall between the couple is because of Kristen Stewart. Patrick Wachsberger, a Lionsgate chairman, recently confirmed the possibility of a Twilight sequel, and recent rumors suggest that the actor is seriously considering to share the screen with his ex-girlfriend again.  So, there are chances that Pattinson’s decision to feature in Twilight’s reboot with Stewart has caused the rife between him and Twigs.  Meanwhile, Twigs was not sporting her engagement ring during their recent trip and many are believing that they have officially parted their ways. InTouch also reported that the couple’s friends think that things are not going too well between them as she is very dominating.  “[She] isn’t the girl for him. She’s very jealous and he was sick of having to explain himself,” the insider added. “He’s still young and just decided he wasn’t ready to settle down.”  shadow creeper fam. A photo posted by FKA twigs (@fkatwigs) on Aug 14, 2016 at 2:54pm PDT  Robert was recently under media radar when there were rumors that the reason why he is not marrying Tahliah is because he is gay. A hoax website claimed that Little Ashes star has come out as gay. The website, which apparently later deleted the post, falsely claimed that he cannot accept the fact that Kristen is thinking to settle down with Alicia Cargile.  “I completely fell for this guy and at first I thought I was confused with my emotions and I did not want to let my female fans down. But after careful consideration, I felt it was best to come out to the public and confirm that I am gay,” the website claimed that the actor told to an imaginary news station.  Apart from this fabricated news, the publication went on to claim that Gay Times magazine has offered him “a multi-million dollar modeling contract.”  Personal Shopper actress, Kristen Stewart, came out as a lesbian in July when she officially talked about her ongoing relationship with Cargile. During her recent interview, she talked about her sexuality and her approach towards dating.  “When I was dating a guy I was hiding everything that I did because everything personal felt like it was immediately trivialized, so I didn’t like it,” she further said. “We were turned into these characters and placed into this ridiculous comic book, and I was like, ‘That’s mine. You’re making my relationship something that it’s not.’ I didn’t like that. But then it changed when I started dating a girl. I was like, ‘Actually, to hide this provides the implication that I’m not down with it or I’m ashamed of it, so I had to alter how I approached being in public. It opened my life up and I’m so much happier.'”  So, according to the hoax site, if Kristen can realize about her sexual preferences then Robert can also come out as a gay.  Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs’ representatives have not commented on the recent reports about the pregnancy or about their split, so fans should consider the pregnancy reports as only speculations.  Do you think that Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs will have a child out of wedlock? Sound off in the comments below.  [Featured Image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images]",0
"Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario.The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",0

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.  FILE PHOTO: Show host Ryan Seacrest addresses the audience during the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  Within the United States, the “American Idol” phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” CBS’s “Rock Star”, and Fox’s “The X Factor.”  Pop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.  “I’m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!” wrote Perry. “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”",1
"The Line of Succession to the British Throne  Who will be the next King or Queen?  HRH Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales  Prince Charles is presently heir (next in line) to the British throne. He will not become king until his mother, Queen Elizabeth, abdicates (gives up the throne), retires or dies. When either of these happen, Prince Charles may abdicate and pass the throne to his eldest son Prince William. What is the title of the heir to the British throne? The heir to the throne is always called the Prince of Wales. The title was introduced by King Edward l in 1301, after the conquest of Wales. If the eldest child of the monarch is female, will she become heir to the throne? Yes, if she does not have any brothers. No, if she has a brother. In Britain the crown was normally passed from monarch to eldest son. As King George VI had no son, it passed to his elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II. If a monarch had sons, they took precedence over daughters: thus, although HR The Princess Royal is older than her brothers HRH The Duke of York and HRH The Earl of Wessex, they (and their children) precede her in the order of succession. From 2013, this all changes. Now the oldest child in herit the throne regardless of being a daughter or a son. This means that if William and Kate had had a daughter she would have inherited the throne even if she had a younger brother. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 Succession to the Crown not to depend on gender  In determining the succession to the Crown, the gender of a person born after 28 October 2011 does not give that person, or that person's descendants, precedence over any other person (whenever born). Who can be heir to the British throne? Up until 2013, the succession in the United Kingdom was governed by the Act of Union 1800, which restated the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Bill of Rights (1689). Pre 2013 'Only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, granddaughter of James I, may succeed to the British throne. Neither Catholics, nor those who marry a Catholic, nor those born out of wedlock, may remain in the line of succession.' The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 2. Removal of disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic  A person is not disqualified from succeeding to the Crown or from possessing it as a result of marrying a person of the Roman Catholic faith.  The current Royal Line of Succession is:  (see also the Royal Family Tree ) HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales (1948), eldest son of HM Queen Elizabeth II HRH Prince William of Wales (1982), elder son of HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales Prince George of Cambridge (b 2013), son of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge  HRH Prince Henry of Wales (popularly referred to as Prince Harry), (1984), younger son of HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York (1960), second son of HM Queen Elizabeth II HRH Princess Beatrice of York (1988), elder daughter of HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York HRH Princess Eugenie of York (1990), younger daughter of HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex (1964), youngest son of HM Queen Elizabeth II James Windsor, Viscount Severn (2007), son of HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex Lady Louise Windsor (2003), daughter of HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal (1950), only daughter of HM Queen Elizabeth II Peter Phillips (1977), son of HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal Zara Phillips (1981), daughter of HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (1961), son of HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon The Honourable Charles Armstrong-Jones (1999), son of David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley The Honourable Margarita Armstrong-Jones (2002), daughter of David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley Lady Sarah Chatto (1964), daughter of HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon Samuel Chatto (1996), son of Lady Sarah Chatto Arthur Chatto (1999), son of Lady Sarah Chatto HRH Prince Richard, The Duke of Gloucester (1944), son of HRH The Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, 3rd son of HM King George V  Royal Family Tree",0
"Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",0
"Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season. The Colts defeated the Bears by the score of 29–17. The game was played on February 4, 2007 at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.  This game featured two teams ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who finished with a 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team's tenure in Baltimore; they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. In addition, the Bears' Lovie Smith and the Colts' Tony Dungy both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win.  In the first Super Bowl played in rainy conditions, the Colts overcame a 14–6 first-quarter deficit to outscore the Bears 23–3 in the last three quarters. Chicago posted the then-earliest lead in Super Bowl history when returner Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown after 14 seconds had elapsed (a record later broken in Super Bowl XLVIII when the Seattle Seahawks scored a safety 12 seconds into the game). The Colts forced five turnovers, including cornerback Kelvin Hayden's 56-yard interception return for a touchdown. Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri also scored three field goals. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8.  CBS' broadcast of the game was watched by an estimated average of 93.2 million viewers, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history.[10] The halftime show, headlined by the musician Prince, peaked at 140 million television viewers, and was widely acclaimed by music critics.[11]  Background [ edit ]  Host selection process [ edit ]  Dolphin Stadium won the bid to host Super Bowl XLI on September 17, 2003 after a campaign against Phoenix, Tampa, New York City, and Washington, D.C.. With this game, the Miami Metropolitan Area tied New Orleans, Louisiana as the city to host the most Super Bowls (9).[12]  This was the fourth Super Bowl at Dolphin Stadium, which has also been known as ""Joe Robbie Stadium"" and ""Pro Player Stadium"". The venue previously hosted Super Bowls XXIII (broadcast on NBC), XXIX (on ABC), and XXXIII (on FOX). Super Bowls II, III, V, X, and XIII were also in Miami, but held at the Miami Orange Bowl. This was the first Super Bowl played at the stadium since the city of Miami Gardens where the stadium is located was incorporated on May 13, 2003.  In February 2006, the NFL and the South Florida Super Bowl XLI Host Committee unveiled the slogan ""one game, one dream"" for the game, referring to the entire South Florida region working together to present the event.[13] The Super Bowl XLI logo was also unveiled, featuring the colors orange (to represent the sun) and blue (for the ocean).[13] The ""I"" in the Roman numeral ""XLI"" was drawn to resemble a pylon placed at each corner of an end zone because ""the goal is to get to the game.""[13] The logo had the same shade of orange as the logo of the host city's home team, the Miami Dolphins. The ""XL"" part was similar to that of Super Bowl XL's logo.  Teams [ edit ]  Indianapolis Colts [ edit ]  The Colts' first trip to the Super Bowl in 36 years set a record for longest time between appearances by a team. Their return was the culmination of a nine-year-long building process. In 1998, they drafted quarterback Peyton Manning to lead the team. Over the next four seasons, Manning, along with other stars such as receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James, turned the Colts into one of the best offensive teams in the NFL, but the team struggled to find consistency on defense and always ended up with either a losing season or elimination from the playoffs in the first round. In 2002, Indianapolis fired head coach Jim Mora and replaced him with Tony Dungy. Dungy had developed one of the best defenses in the NFL while coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it was hoped he could solve the Colts' defensive problems as well.  Over the next four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind impressive offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts had one of the most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.  In 2005, the Colts' defense improved, making the team the clear favorites in the NFL. They won the first 13 games of the season and finished with a 14–2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in the divisional round of the playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–18. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys.  Still, the Colts remained one of the AFC's top teams in the 2006 season. Manning made the Pro Bowl for the 7th time in his career, completing 362 of 555 passes for 4,397 yards and an NFL-best 31 touchdowns, with an additional 4 rushing touchdowns and with only 9 interceptions and 15 sacks. His favorite target was Harrison, who caught 95 passes for 1,366 yards and 12 touchdowns. Receiver Reggie Wayne was also a major deep threat with 86 receptions for 1,310 yards and 9 touchdowns. Tight ends Ben Utecht and Dallas Clark were also reliable targets, each recording over 30 receptions for over 300 yards. On the ground, rookie running back Joseph Addai led the team with 1,081 yards and a 4.8 yards-per-carry average despite not starting any games in the regular season. He also caught 40 receptions for 325 yards and scored 8 touchdowns. Running back Dominic Rhodes was also a major contributor, rushing for 641 yards and catching 36 passes for 251 yards. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Jeff Saturday and Tarik Glenn. On special teams, the Colts signed kicker Adam Vinatieri to replace Vanderjagt. While Vinatieri's career field goal percentage was lower, the Colts considered him to be an improvement because of his reputation for making ""clutch"" kicks, a reputation aided by his game winning field goals in Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII.  Indianapolis' defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis (who recorded 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely considered to be among the best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed.  Indianapolis started out the season winning their first nine games, but ended up losing four of their next seven and finished with a 12–4 record, giving them the #3 playoff seed. Thus, having to play in a wild card playoff game. In the playoffs, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23-8, defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15-6 in the divisional round, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI with a 38-34 win over the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.  Chicago Bears [ edit ]  Chicago finished the season with an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in the divisional round of the playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC Championship game to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive.[14] They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive[14] thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.  The Bears offense was led by quarterback Rex Grossman, the team's first round draft pick in 2003. Over the previous three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By the end of the season, he finished with 3,193 yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding turnovers, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach Lovie Smith to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.  Receivers Muhsin Muhammad (60 receptions, 863 yards, 5 touchdowns) and Bernard Berrian (51 receptions, 775 yards, 7 touchdowns) provided the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end Desmond Clark, who caught 45 passes for 626 yards and 6 touchdowns. Chicago's running game was led by running backs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson. Jones rushed for 1,210 yards and caught 36 passes, while Benson rushed for 647 yards and scored 6 touchdowns.  Chicago's defense allowed the 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100 yards per game on the ground,[15] and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team.[14] The line was anchored by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, two of the three Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able to make up for the offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.  The loss of Harris to injury after the twelfth game of the season coincided with a decline in defensive performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9).[16] After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship game were held below 21 points.[17]  The Bears' special teams sent three players to the Pro Bowl, including special teams ace Brendon Ayanbadejo, kicker Robbie Gould (who led all NFL kickers with 143 points), and rookie return man Devin Hester, who gained 600 punt return yards with a 12.8 yards per return average, the second highest in the NFL. He also set a league record with 6 touchdowns on special teams.  Regular season statistical comparison [ edit ]  The chart below provides a comparison of regular season statistics in key categories (overall rank amongst 32 teams in parentheses).[18]  Statistic Indianapolis Colts Chicago Bears Points scored per game 26.7 (2nd, tied) 26.7 (2nd, tied) Points allowed per game 22.5 (23rd) 15.9 (3rd) Rushing yards gained per game 110.1 (18th) 119.9 (15th) Rushing yards allowed per game 173.0 (32nd) 99.4 (6th) Passing yards gained per game 269.2 (2nd) 205.1 (14th) Passing yards allowed per game 159.2 (2nd) 194.8 (11th) Yards gained per play 6.0 (2nd) 5.0 (21st) Yards allowed per play 5.5 (29th) 4.6 (2nd) Time of possession per game 29:32 (23rd) 30:56 (11th) Third-down conversion percentage 56 (1st) 37 (22nd) Third-down conversion percentage allowed 47 (32nd) 31 (2nd) Fourth-down conversion percentage 0 (32nd) 69 (4th, tied) Fourth-down conversion percentage allowed 79 (30th, tied) 62 (27th) Total turnover differential +7 (7th) +8 (4th)  Playoffs [ edit ]  Although the Colts' rushing defense looked extremely weak during the season, it ended up being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, holding Chiefs running back Larry Johnson (who rushed for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6, winning on a playoff record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back Jamal Lewis (who rushed for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.  Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England jumped to an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed back in the second half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an additional field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69 yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.  Meanwhile, the Bears started out their post-season with a 27–24 win over the Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they defeated the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship Game. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. Thomas Jones finished the game with a franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.  It was the first time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference championship games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game (the St. Louis Rams were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl, XXXIV inside the Georgia Dome in Atlanta). The 2006 Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (2003 Carolina Panthers) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.  For the Bears, this marked the first time that a Chicago sports team not owned by Jerry Reinsdorf had reached the champion game/series in their league since the Blackhawks lost in the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.  Super Bowl pre-game practices and notes [ edit ]  Dolphin Stadium prepares for Super Bowl XLI  The Indianapolis Colts held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Dolphins Training Facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. The Colts' ""Team and Family"" hotel was the Marriott Harbor Beach.[19] At the 2007 Indianapolis 500 pre-race ceremonies on May 27, 2007, eventual Super Bowl XLI MVP Peyton Manning stated to ABC Sports commentator Brent Musburger the day before the game that two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Hélio Castroneves gave a pep talk to the Colts team.  The Chicago Bears held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Hurricanes Football Facility, on the campus of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.  Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson was required to request a judge's order to leave the state of Illinois due to an arrest for unlicensed ownership of six firearms and two assault rifles. On January 23, 2007, the judge granted him permission to travel out of state to play in the Super Bowl.[20]  Chicago and Indianapolis are the two closest cities, geographically, to ever play in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293 km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are slightly closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, at the end of the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.[21]  This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl VI that all players on both teams wore black shoes.  Broadcasting [ edit ]  United States [ edit ]  The game was televised in the United States by CBS in high-definition with play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz and color commentator Phil Simms. This was the first Super Bowl announced by Nantz.[22] Additionally, the game had Steve Tasker (Bears sideline) and Solomon Wilcots (Colts sideline) reporting on the sidelines and Lesley Visser (Bears sideline) and Sam Ryan (Colts sideline) in the stands.  This was the first Super Bowl aired on CBS since the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake incident three years earlier, in Super Bowl XXXVIII; and the first since the Viacom/CBS split at the end of 2005. Extensive pre-game coverage, hosted by The NFL Today team of James Brown, Shannon Sharpe, Boomer Esiason and Dan Marino, whose name graces the address of the game site (2269 Dan Marino Boulevard), began at noon (US EST) with NFL Films' ""Road to the Super Bowl"" year in review (narrated by Tom Selleck). This was followed by ""The Phil Simms All-Iron Team"", and a four-and-a-half-hour Super Bowl Today pre-game show followed by game coverage at 6:25 PM.[23] Other contributors to the pre-game show included Katie Couric, anchor of the CBS Evening News, Armen Keteyian, CBS News Chief Investigative Corrrespondent, Randy Cross, who reported from Iraq where U.S. military forces played a touch football game known as ""The Baghdad Bowl"" and Dick Enberg, who participated in his 12th Super Bowl telecast as a host, play-by-play announcer, or contributor. Westwood One provided radio coverage of the event, with Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason as announcers.[24]  ""The Baghdad Bowl"" flag football game played in Iraq.  The American Forces Network (AFN) provided coverage of the Super Bowl for U.S. forces stationed overseas and to all U.S. Navy ships at sea.[25]  The opening title sequence of CBS television coverage featured the composition Lux Aeterna, by artist Clint Mansell, in the background.  Nielsen Media Research reported 93 million viewers for Super Bowl XLI, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history (trailing only the M*A*S*H finale and Super Bowls XLIII, XXX, and XLII).[10]  Commercials [ edit ]  Advertising rates were reported as being slightly higher than in the year before, with CBS confirming a price of $2.6 million for some 30-second spots, compared with $2.5 million during Super Bowl XL. However, CNN reported that after discounts, the average price is likely closer to $1.8 to $2 million. Familiar advertisers in recent years such as Anheuser-Busch, CareerBuilder, General Motors and Coca-Cola bought multiple advertising spots, and other popular advertisers like Go Daddy and Emerald Nuts had commercials this year.[9]  The only major hype related to commercials in the months leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.[26]  The annual USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter survey chose a Budweiser ad featuring crabs worshiping an ice chest with that particular beer inside as the top ad of Super Bowl XLI, followed by another Bud commercial featuring a stray dog with mud spots climbing onto the brewery's trademark Clydsedale-drawn wagon in a parade. In all, Anheuser-Busch took seven of the top ten spots in the annual survey, sweeping the top three spots. A YouTube user survey chose the Doritos ""Snack Hard"" ad (produced for the incredible price of $12, the cost of three bags of the snack product)[27] as their top ad, that ad finished fourth in the USA Today survey. ADBOWL results were slightly different with only 6 of Anheuser-Busch's ads finishing in the top ten. The highest ranked being the Bud Light ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" spot. Also in the top ten were Blockbuster Video's ""Mouse"", Doritos' ""Car Wreck"", GM's ""Robot"" and Taco Bell's ""Lion's Talk 'Carne'.""  One ad that drew criticism from the gay community was for the Snickers candy bar featuring two men accidentally ""kissing"" each other after sharing the product in question, then proceeded to rip chest hairs as a manly act as homophobic.[28] The ad proved to be controversial, and the ad was cancelled the next day by Masterfoods USA (Mars, Incorporated's snack food division), and three other versions were deleted from the snickers.com web site. The ad was ninth in the USA Today ad survey, and according to a Masterfoods publicist, not intended to harm anyone.  A different ad for General Motors featured a laid off assembly line robot contemplating suicide, which drew criticism from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad be taken off the air and the company's website.[29] The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.  International [ edit ]  The Super Bowl was broadcast live in Canada on CBS (which is available in Canada) as well as Global TV and NTV which both took the main CBS commentary, and on the French cable channel RDS. In the United Kingdom the Super Bowl was broadcast on ITV1, Sky Sports 1 & Sky Sports HD1 with Sky Sports taking the main CBS commentary and ITV taking the NFL supplied international commentary feed of Spero Dedes and Sterling Sharpe.  Super Bowl XLI was broadcast in over 200 countries. Amongst the television networks who broadcast Super Bowl XLI were:  Entertainment [ edit ]  Pre-game ceremonies [ edit ]  Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega performed as the pre-game act,[32] and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was played at the same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.[33]  Marlee Matlin and Jason Hay-Southwell performed the National Anthem in American Sign Language.[34]  Besides participating in the CBS telecast of the pre-game show, Dan Marino also participated in the coin toss along with Norma Hunt, the widow of Lamar Hunt, the former owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and the man who gave the Super Bowl its name.  Halftime show [ edit ]  American singer and musician Prince headlined the halftime show  American singer and musician Prince performed in the halftime show.[35] The setlist for Prince's performance was a short rendition of ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen; Prince's hit songs ""Let's Go Crazy"" and ""Baby I'm a Star""; covers of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Proud Mary"", Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"", and Foo Fighters' ""Best of You""; and finally his signature song ""Purple Rain"" in the downpour. The 12-minute performance featured Prince accompanied by two dancers he called ""The Twinz"" (Maya and Nandy McClean)[36] and the Florida A&M University marching band, the Marching 100.[37] Prince had rehearsed with the drum line for a week before the performance. The performance was on a large, central stage which was shaped like Prince's logo, and was outlined with lights. He played before 74,512 fans at Dolphin Stadium, who had been given flashlights to point at the stage during the performance of ""Purple Rain"". The event was carried ""to the biggest audience of his life"" with 140 million television viewers.[11] Overall, the show was energetic and well received by the rain-soaked audience surrounding the stage.[38] Music critics were extremely enthusiastic about his performance, one calling it ""arguably the best halftime show in Super Bowl history"",[11] and others saying it was one of the best ever.[39][40]  Following the game, controversy emerged about a silhouetted camera shot of Prince, projected against a large sheet by a bright light on the other side of him. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it ""looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed"". Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that ""a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus"".[41] In 2015, Entertainment Tonight listed the silhouetted camera shot, naming it ""Prince's Demon Phallus"", as one of the top seven Super Bowl halftime moments.[42] In 2016, shortly after Prince's death, the halftime show's producer Don Mischer said that having a silhouetted camera shot of Prince was his idea, but denied it was meant to be a phallic statement.[43]  Post-game ceremonies [ edit ]  Former Colts and Dolphins head coach Don Shula presented the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Colts after the game, and Peyton Manning was named MVP.[44]  Game summary [ edit ]  First Quarter [ edit ]  The Bears won the coin toss and elected to receive. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game was played in the rain, which was continuous throughout the game.  The rain did not hinder Bears' return man Devin Hester, who ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown to give Chicago the then earliest lead in Super Bowl history, after only 14 seconds.[45] The Colts avoided kicking to Hester for the rest of the game, allowing him only one punt return, and choosing to squib kick whenever Hester was in the deep kickoff return position.[citation needed]  On Indianapolis' first drive of the game, defensive back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning and returned it 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and they were forced to punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.  On the first play after the turnover, Thomas Jones's 52-yard run moved the ball to the Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving the Bears a 14–6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.  Second Quarter [ edit ]  Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinatieri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14–9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive, and return man Terrence Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to his own 42-yard line. Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to Marvin Harrison. His next pass went to tight end Dallas Clark for 17 yards. Two more completions moved the ball to the Bears' 11-yard line, and then Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16–14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.  After another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.  Third Quarter [ edit ]  Wilkins returned the second half kickoff 26 yards to the Colts's 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25 yards and caught four passes for 19 yards as the Colts drove 56 yards in 13 plays and scored with a 29-yard field goal from Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19–14. On the Bears' next drive, Jones started out with a 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down and one on the Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Anthony McFarland. Then, on third down, he fumbled the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52 yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked his third field goal to make the score 22–14.  Chicago tight end John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff and returned it 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15 yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was enough for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.  Fourth Quarter [ edit ]  After an Indianapolis 7-play drive ended in a punt, Chicago started on their own 20-yard line with 13:38 left in the game. But four plays later, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown.  From that point on, the Colts took over the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.  Box score [ edit ]  Statistical overview [ edit ]  This was the third Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and Thomas Jones had 112 for the Bears. Tony Dungy is the third man to win the Super Bowl as a head coach as well as a player, following Tom Flores and Mike Ditka.  For the Colts, Rhodes rushed for 113 yards and a touchdown, while also catching an 8-yard reception. Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned four kickoffs for 89 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Adam Vinatieri became the first kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls and the first to win four Super Bowl rings. Vinatieri's three field goals and two extra points gave him 49 points for the entire 2006 post-season, an NFL record. The Colts' win was the first major professional championship for Indiana since the Indiana Pacers' ABA title in the 1972–73 season.  Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII). Hester's return also kept a streak alive for there being a kickoff return for a touchdown in each Super Bowl played at Dolphin Stadium. Hester's and Wayne's touchdowns in the first quarter marked the first time in Super Bowl history the first two touchdowns were scored by players from the same college (University of Miami). Jones was the Bears' top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching four passes for 18 yards. Desmond Clark was the Bears' top receiver with six receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, leaving him with a QB rating of 68.3 for the game.[48] Muhsin Muhammad became the third player ever to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl for two teams, joining Ricky Proehl and Jerry Rice.

Originally, spokesmen for Dolphin Stadium announced that tailgating would be permitted as usual. However, the NFL quickly contradicted this statement, announcing an NFL owner-imposed ban on all tailgating and prohibiting non-ticketed fans within a two-block-radius of the stadium.[50]  Prohibiting church display [ edit ]  The NFL upset a large number of fans by threatening churches with lawsuits if they had Super Bowl parties. National Football League assistant counsel Rachel L. Margolies sent a letter to the Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website.[51] She said that the church could not use the words ""Super Bowl"" as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates copyright law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55 inches), and could not ""promote a message"" in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. ""While this may be a noble message"", Rachel L. Margolies wrote, ""we are consistent in refusing the use of our game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content.""[52] Sports bars nationwide were allowed to show the game, as were businesses that televised sports as part of their everyday operations because they didn't charge admission and they left the message the NFL intended intact.  The Indianapolis Star picked up the story, and soon pastors across the U.S. were working to cancel their parties. Immediately the NFL received a backlash of bad publicity, with indignant football fans in constant sarcasm (akin to rules imposed about on-field behavior i.e. taunting opposition teams) referring to the NFL as the ""No Fun League.""[53] For example, the enforcement of this policy earned the NFL a ""Worst Person in the World"" silver on the edition of February 2, 2007 of Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[54]  After a long series of bad press, the NFL issued a written statement clarifying their policy, saying that they did not object to churches hosting Super Bowl parties so long as they did not charge admission and showed the game on ""a television of the type commonly used at home"". This statement did not attempt to forbid coordination of any other message with the game, something typically done by churches, nor did it attempt to forbid the use of the term ""Super Bowl.""[55][56]",1

"Kate Noelle ""Katie"" Holmes (born December 18, 1978)[7] is an American actress, producer, and director. She first achieved fame as Joey Potter on the television series Dawson's Creek (1998–2003).  She made her feature film debut in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm in 1997. Subsequent film roles include: Go, Teaching Mrs. Tingle (both 1999), Wonder Boys, The Gift (both 2000), Abandon (2002), Phone Booth, The Singing Detective, Pieces of April (all 2003), Batman Begins (2005), Thank You for Smoking (2006), Mad Money (2008), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Jack and Jill (both 2011), Miss Meadows (2014), Woman in Gold, Touched with Fire (both 2015), and Logan Lucky (2017).  In 2008, she made her Broadway theatre debut in a production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons. In 2011, she played Jacqueline Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys, a role she reprised in The Kennedys: After Camelot (2017). She made her directional debut with the 2016 film All We Had, in which she also starred.  Her marriage to actor Tom Cruise[8] from 2006 to 2012 led to a great deal of media attention, with the pair being called a supercouple and being given the nickname ""TomKat"" in various countries.  Early life [ edit ]  Holmes was born in Toledo, Ohio.[9] She is the youngest of five children born to Kathleen, a homemaker and philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr., an attorney.[10][11] She has three sisters and one brother. Holmes was baptized a Roman Catholic and attended Christ the King Church in Toledo.[12]  She graduated from the all-female Notre Dame Academy in Toledo (also her mother's alma mater), where she was a 4.0 student.[13][14] At St. John's Jesuit and St. Francis de Sales, nearby all-male high schools, Holmes appeared in school musicals, playing a waitress in Hello, Dolly! and Lola in Damn Yankees.[15] She scored 1310 out of 1600 on her SAT and was accepted to Columbia University (and attended for a summer session);[9][13] her father wanted her to become a doctor.[14]  At age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo which led her to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue from To Kill a Mockingbird.[6] An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 film The Ice Storm, directed by Ang Lee, and Holmes made her big-screen debut in the role of Libbets Casey in the film, opposite Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver.[15]  Career [ edit ]  1997–2003: Dawson's Creek and career development [ edit ]  Holmes in May 2006  In January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles for pilot season, when producers cast and shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. The Toledo Blade reported she was offered the lead in Buffy the Vampire Slayer but she turned it down in order to finish high school.[15] Columbia TriStar Television, producer of a new show named Dawson's Creek that was created by screenwriter Kevin Williamson, asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. ""I was doing my school play, Damn Yankees. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, 'There is no way I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn't let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, 'I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week. I've got other commitments.'""[5][15][16]  The producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part of Joey Potter, the tomboy best friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson's lines.[5][17]  The Hollywood Reporter claimed the story of Holmes's audition ""has become the stuff of legend"" and ""no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition via Federal Express.""[18] Holmes won the part. Paul Stupin, executive producer of the show, said his first reaction on seeing her audition tape was ""That's Joey Potter!""[19] Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a ""unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that's just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell.""[20] Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey Potter. ""She had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness.""[21] While Dawson's Creek was met with mixed reviews,[22] Holmes attained national attention.[23][24] Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such as Seventeen, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor at Rolling Stone said she was chosen for the cover because ""every time you mention Dawson's Creek you tend to get a lot of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn't hurt either.""[25]  During her time as a series regular on Dawson's Creek, Holmes first leading role in a film came in 1998's Disturbing Behavior, a Scream-era Stepford Wives-goes-to-high school thriller, where she was a loner from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was recut from what the director intended. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote her character, Rachel, ""dresses in black and likes to strike poses on the beds of pickup trucks and is a bad girl who is in great danger of becoming a very good one.""[26][27] Despite the fact that it received mixed reviews and was not a huge financial success, the actress won a MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance for the role and also received a Saturn Award nomination for the part. Holmes, though, said the film was ""just horrible.""[14] In 1999, she played a disaffected supermarket clerk in Doug Liman's ensemble piece Go.[28] The film received excellent reviews and made a profit, and Holmes herself was liked by critics. The same year, in Kevin Williamson's Teaching Mrs. Tingle, which he wrote and directed, Holmes played a straight-A student whose vindictive teacher (Helen Mirren) threatens to keep her from a desperately needed scholarship.[29] Also in 1999, she had an uncredited cameo with Dawson's Creek co-star Joshua Jackson in Muppets from Space, which was filmed in Wilmington where Dawson's Creek also filmed.[30]  The year 2000 saw Holmes feature in two film roles. The first was in Wonder Boys, directed by Curtis Hanson from the novel by Michael Chabon. The film told the story of a creative writing teacher at a university, with Michael Douglas in the leading role. Holmes had a small role (six and one-half minutes of screen time) as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp (Douglas's character, who is her instructor and landlord). Many leading critics at the time took favorable notice to Holmes in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said she was ""just right as the beauty with kind of a crush on the old man.""[21][31][32] Her second feature film during 2000 was The Gift, a Southern Gothic story directed by Sam Raimi and starring Cate Blanchett, she played the antithesis of Joey Potter: a promiscuous rich girl having affairs with everyone from a sociopathic wife-beater (Keanu Reeves) to the district attorney (Gary Cole), and is murdered by her fiancé (Greg Kinnear). Holmes did her first nude scene for the film, in a scene where her character was about to be murdered. Her appearance was lamented by Variety's Steven Kotler.[33] In Ohio, the scene met with disapproval from Russ Lemmon writing in the Toledo Blade.[34]  Holmes hosted Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up of Dawson's Creek where she falls madly in love with Chris Kattan's Mr. Peepers character and singing ""Big Spender"" from Sweet Charity. In the 2002 film Abandon, written by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named ""Katie"". Todd McCarthy of Variety and Roger Ebert commended her performance,[35] but other critics savaged it.[36] During the final season of Dawson's Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played by Colin Farrell in Phone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared as Robert Downey, Jr.'s nurse in The Singing Detective (2003). Dawson's Creek ended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. ""It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else"", she said in 2004.[37]  2003–2009: Focus on film career, brief hiatus, and theatre work [ edit ]  Holmes' first starring role post-Dawson's Creek was in 2003's Pieces of April, a gritty comedy about a dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving. Many critics and audiences agreed that Holmes had given her best performance in the film as April. Variety said it was ""one of her best film performances.""[38] ""Each actor shines"", wrote Elvis Mitchell, ""even Ms. Holmes, whose beauty seems to have fogged the minds of her previous directors"" in playing ""a brat who is slaving to find her inner decency and barely has the equipment for such an achievement, let alone to serve a meal whose salmonella potential could claim an entire borough. Yet it is her surliness, as well as her intransigent determination to make Thanksgiving work, that keeps the laughs coming.""[39] Holmes also received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for the role. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she was Punk'd by Ashton Kutcher and the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV program Diary.[40]  Holmes was a contender for the role of Christine Daaé in 2004's The Phantom of the Opera,[41] but lost the role to Emmy Rossum. She later played the President's daughter in First Daughter, which was originally to be released in January 2004 on the same day as Chasing Liberty, another film about a president's daughter, but was ultimately released in September 2004 to dismal reviews and ticket sales. First Daughter, directed by Forest Whitaker, also starred Michael Keaton as her father and Marc Blucas as her love interest. The Hollywood Reporter critic called her character, Samantha Mackenzie, ""a startling example of how a studio film can dumb down and neutralize the comic abilities of a lively young star.""[42] In the 2005 film Batman Begins she played Rachel Dawes, an attorney in the Gotham City district attorney's office and the childhood sweetheart of the title character. Variety was unenthusiastic. ""Holmes is OK"", was its critic's sole remark on her performance.[43] She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for ""worst supporting actress"" for the film.[44]  In 2005, Holmes characterised her film career as being a string of ""bombs."" ""Usually I'm not even in the top ten"", she said, the highest-grossing film of her career then being Phone Booth.[3] She lamented ""It's not like I have a lot of stuff that's great just waiting for me to sign on to.""[45] She also appeared in the film version of Christopher Buckley's satirical novel Thank You for Smoking about a tobacco lobbyist played by Aaron Eckhart, whom Holmes's character, a Washington reporter, seduces. Variety wrote one of the film's ""sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter"" and The New York Times said the cast was ""exceptionally fine"" except for Holmes, who ""strain[ed] credulity"" in her role.[46][47] The film ended up a success, even earning a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Also in 2005, Holmes had agreed to play in Shame on You, a biopic about the country singer Spade Cooley written and directed by Dennis Quaid, as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death. But the picture, set to shoot in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed by Hurricane Katrina, and Holmes dropped out due to her pregnancy.[48][49][50] After her daughter, Suri Cruise, was born in April 2006, Holmes took a hiatus from her acting career until 2008.[citation needed]  After speculation about Holmes reprising her role in The Dark Knight, the sequel to Batman Begins, it was finally confirmed that she would not appear. Her role was later recast with Maggie Gyllenhaal in her place.[51] Instead, Holmes decided to star in the comedy Mad Money, opposite Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah in 2008. The film flopped.[52] The Canadian Press criticized Holmes's performance, ""While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought.""[53] The New York Post, the New York Times and Variety also criticized Holmes' performance in the film, and the New York Times called Holmes ""the movie's weakest link"".[54][55]  Returning to television in 2008, Holmes appeared in an episode of Eli Stone as Grace, a lawyer, and her singing and dancing was praised by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly.[56] Holmes made her Broadway debut in the revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons[57] in October 2008. She opened to mixed reviews. Ben Brantley of The New York Times claimed ""the neophyte Ms. Holmes"" is a ""sad casualty"" of director Simon McBurney's ""high concept approach"" to the play. He adds that ""Ms. Holmes delivers most of her lines with meaningful asperity, italicizing every word.""[58] Clive Barnes of the New York Post was similarly unimpressed by Holmes – and had few compliments for her co-stars. He wrote, ""John Lithgow starts in a sunny, benign fashion, but eventually finds himself screeching alongside Holmes, looking tough under a glossy wig.""[59] However, the New York Daily News' Joe Dziemianowicz took a more positive view of her stage debut, writing, ""Holmes, a TV and film vet, makes a fine Broadway debut. Her rather grand speech pattern takes getting used to, but she seems comfortable and adds a fitting glint of glamour.""[60] In 2009, Holmes appeared in the National Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue with Dianne Wiest celebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, José Pequeño.[61]  2010–present: Television work and return to film [ edit ]  In early July 2009, Holmes began filming a remake of the 1970s ABC telemovie Don't Be Afraid of the Dark; the film was released in August 2011.[62] Also in 2011, Holmes played the role of Jackie Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys. In October 2011, she also portrayed ""Slutty Pumpkin"" (Naomi), in the TV show How I Met Your Mother, episode ""The Slutty Pumpkin Returns"".[citation needed]  In late 2012, Holmes was set to appear in Theresa Rebeck's Dead Accounts on Broadway.[63] Holmes and Chace Crawford were reportedly cast as the leads in the romantic comedy Responsible Adults, to begin shooting in Los Angeles in ""Fall 2011"".[64][65][66] In 2015, Holmes joined the third season of Ray Donovan.[67]  Holmes directed a short 2015 documentary for ESPN about Olympic gymnast Nadia Comăneci entitled, Eternal Princess, that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.[68][69]  In 2017, Holmes starred in the heist comedy Logan Lucky, and in 2018, she will appear in the satirical comedy Dear Dictator, opposite Michael Caine.[70]  In a September 2016 Elle interview, Holmes stated that she is in the process of adapting the Kathleen Tessaro novel Rare Objects into a screenplay and will direct the film.[71] It was announced Holmes will also be leading a feature film based around the self-help book, The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne.[72]  Public image [ edit ]  Holmes was annually named by both the British and American editions of FHM magazine as one of the sexiest women in the world from 1999 onward. She was named one of People's ""50 Most Beautiful People"" in 2003; its sibling Teen People declared her one of the ""25 Hottest Stars Under 25"" that year;[73][74] and in 2005, People said she was one of the ten best dressed stars that year.[75] She has appeared in advertisements for Garnier Lumia haircolor, Coach leather goods, and clothing retailer Gap.[76]  In November 2008, it was confirmed that she would be the new face of the spring 2009 campaign for the high-end fashion line Miu Miu.[77] In 2008, Holmes started a high fashion clothing line called Holmes & Yang with longtime stylist Jeanne Yang.[78] Model Heidi Klum is a fan of the line.[79] In July 2009, Holmes, Nigel Lythgoe, Adam Shankman, and Carrie Ann Inaba announced the launch of a dance scholarship fund called the Dizzy Feet Foundation.[80]  Beginning January 2011, she became the new face of Ann Taylor Spring 11 collection.[81] Holmes & Yang presented their fashion line at New York Fashion Week for the first time in September 2012.[82][83] Holmes acted as the face for the Bobbi Brown Cosmetics brand in spring 2013 and Holmes had her own capsule collection of color cosmetics in fall of that year.[84] In 2013, she appeared in an advertising campaign for IRIS Jewelry.[85] In January 2013, Holmes was announced as the brand ambassador and co-owner of Alterna Haircare.[86]  Personal life [ edit ]  Holmes with Tom Cruise in May 2009  Holmes dated her Dawson's Creek co-star Joshua Jackson early in the show's run.[87] She met actor Chris Klein in 2000. Klein and Holmes were engaged in late 2003, but in early 2005 she and Klein ended their relationship.[88][89][90][91] Klein and Holmes have remained friends to varying degrees since the breakup.[92]  Only a couple of weeks after her relationship with Klein ended, Holmes began dating actor Tom Cruise in April 2005. Holmes, who was raised a Catholic,[93] began studying Scientology shortly after the couple began dating.[94] They got engaged in June 2005, only seven weeks after meeting.[95] The couple's daughter, Suri, was born on April 18, 2006, the one-year anniversary of their first date. The name ""Suri"" supposedly derives from the Persian meaning ""Red Rose"" and the Hebrew as a derivative of ""Sarah"" meaning princess.[96] On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married in a Scientologist ceremony at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy.[8] The actors' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[97]  Holmes and Cruise were last photographed together in Iceland on June 16, 2012. On June 29, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise in New York after five and a half years of marriage.[98][99] Following the announcement, those close to Holmes stated that she believed she had reason to fear that Cruise would abduct Suri, and also feared intimidation by the Church of Scientology.[100][101]  Only ten days after Holmes filed for divorce, on July 9, 2012, attorneys for the couple announced that the couple had signed a divorce settlement.[102] This was the first divorce for Holmes and the third for Cruise.[103][104] Holmes has custody of Suri.[105]  Following her divorce from Cruise, Holmes returned to the Roman Catholic Church and began attending St. Francis Xavier Church.[106]  Legal issues [ edit ]  In early March 2011, Holmes filed a $50-million libel lawsuit against Star magazine following a cover story which insinuated that she took drugs.[107] The suit was settled on April 27, 2011, after which Star wrote a public apology in the May 6, 2011 issue and made an ""undisclosed substantial donation"" to Holmes's charity, Dizzy Feet Foundation.[108]  Awards [ edit ]  In June 2011, Holmes received the Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future Award.[109]  In 2005, TV Guide ranked Holmes No. 38 on its ""50 Sexiest Stars of All Time"" list.[110]  Filmography [ edit ]  Video games Year Title Role Notes 2005 Batman Begins Rachel Dawes Voice  Notes [ edit ]  ^ [1] and others ""Kate"" to be Holmes' legal name.[2][3][4][5][6] The Several sources state ""Katherine""and others ""Kate"" to be Holmes' legal name.The birth certificate of Holmes's daughter, Suri, lists the actress's name as ""Kate Noelle Holmes"".

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Randee Dawn  Everyone always says that if you love something, set it free. But maybe there's a more modern version: have it cloned so you get to keep it around a little longer.  After all, that's what iconic singer and actress Barbra Streisand did, as she revealed to Variety on Tuesday. When her beloved 14-year-old Coton du Tulear dog Samantha wasn't doing well, she had her cloned ... twice!  Samantha died in May 2017, and over the new year Streisand welcomed adorable new pups into her life: Miss Violet and Miss Scarlet, who are clones of Samantha. Before their ""mama"" passed, Streisand had cells taken from Samantha's mouth and stomach, and ... voila! Adorable fluffy pups that match her DNA.  ""They have different personalities,"" she told Variety. ""I'm waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have (Samantha's) brown eyes and seriousness.""  She's also got a third dog named Miss Fanny, who is a distant cousin of Samantha's and is named after Streisand's Oscar-winning turn as Fanny Brice from 1968 film ""Funny Girl.""  Our new basket of adorables A post shared by Barbra Streisand (@barbrastreisand) on Dec 25, 2017 at 11:25am PST  When the three first arrived, she dressed them in different-colored sweaters to tell them apart.  Prices for the procedure vary; Time reports that in 2015 one leading company was reportedly charging $100,000 to clone a dog while others report the procedure costs $50,000 for a dog and $25,000 for a cat.  Whether for financial or emotional reasons, fans told TODAY that they would not choose to clone their pet.  Barbra Streisand recently revealed that she cloned her late dog. Would you want to clone your pet? — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 28, 2018  Streisand has completely embraced the clone lifestyle, dressing her new canine friends in designer clothing and buying cute toys for them. According to Variety, she wanted a portrait taken of herself with the dogs that could be called ""Send in the Clones.""  There's still a part of Streisand, however, that will always miss Samantha, the ""mom"" of her pet family.  Here's to Miss Violet and Miss Scarlet and Miss Fanny carrying on her memory.

"Former The Walking Dead star Michael Cudlitz, better known to fans of the show as Abraham Ford, has some harsh words for the show he used to be a part of. Abraham met his end alongside Glenn (Steven Yeun) when Negan took his bat Lucille to both their skulls at the beginning of Season 7. In retrospect, it was a pretty good time to leave The Walking Dead.  It was the beginning of the end for AMC's zombie drama, at least until its surprising revival in Season 9 under the welcome stewardship of new showrunner Angela Kang. But the sad fact remains: Seasons 7 and 8 were horrible, no good lousy seasons of television that made so many poor choices I couldn't list them all if I tried.  And the show has suffered for it, with ratings collapsing even as it finally drags itself back from the brink. Indeed, both myself and my colleague Paul Tassi agree that Season 9 is one of the best so far (we talk at length about this in our Walking Dead podcast here.)  In any case, I'm not alone in thinking the past two seasons were hot garbage. Abraham actor Michael Cudlitz had some choice words recently for the show and its lead protagonist, Rick Grimes. Speaking at the Atlanta Walker Stalker Con, Cudlitz laid down some hard truths:  “Let’s be real clear, if he was gonna kill anyone other than me and I had a choice, it would be Rick. Because how many more people was that a—hole gonna get killed?” Cudlitz said, according to ComicBook.com. And while the audience was apparently shocked by this statement, he's not wrong. Rick led his people into one disaster after another. This started long before the disastrous Negan storyline, but Rick reached new heights of recklessness and stupidity as the show's writing quality plummeted.  More Cudlitz:  “’Hey, I got a plan, let’s show up to where all the Saviors are with 500 weapons, have them step 15 feet out into the balcony unarmed, and shoot the windows out above his head.’ You all know that sucked [...] It was like the A-Team showed up.""  Apparently at this point the actor started ""miming stray firing before imitating the showy Savior leader.""  Cudlitz again, mocking the terribleness of this scene which, if Rick had simply shot Negan when he first swaggered out the door, would have put a blessed end to this whole nonsensical plot:  “He’s right there! He’s right there! He walks out the door. It’s not even like he peeks out. He’s like ‘Well, Rick! Ha ha ha! We better run!’”  This is all too hilarious to me, as it really brings me back to my own review of that episode:  Earlier, in Rick's speech, he made clear that only one Savior had to die: Negan. (They go and kill several lookouts right after that speech, so it's more like ""only five people have to die"" but who's counting?) And who should walk out onto his doorstep in plain view of all these heavily armed rebels? Who gives them all the perfect chance to take him out then and there? Who swaggers like he's the king of all he sees, never once worried that maybe Rick had given orders to shoot him on sight? If you guessed Negan, you win. The Big Bad walks right out there like he hasn't got a care in the world. He's soon followed by his lieutenants, including the coward, Eugene, and the traitor, Dwight. It turns out, he had nothing to be afraid of. Despite being heavily armed, despite having multiple weapons with scopes and a clear shot, despite coming to do this very thing, nobody opens fire on Negan. Why? This is one of those incredibly frustrating moments that have come more and more to define The Walking Dead. Because there's really no good explanation as to why nobody shoots Negan the moment he showed his smug face. There's no reason one of the dozens of rebels couldn't have popped him at such close range.  I should point out that Rick also had snipers that expertly took out the Savior lookouts just before all this (so more like 7 or 8 people had to die, just none of them ended up being Negan because Rick eventually spared him out of mercy moments after murdering other Saviors who had helped him.)  In any case, it's quite hilarious to see Cudlitz lay into the show with such naked honesty. Season 8 was just so horrendously awful it very nearly killed the show entirely. For instance, that Season 8 premiere review I linked to up above? That got 424,000 views. My Season 7 premiere review got over 700,000 views. Fast forward to my Season 9 premiere review? 125,000 views, and a steady drop in views ever since.  This isn't just people not watching the show the night of, it's people running for the hills. And it's come to this because nobody at AMC had the nerve to step in and save the show from its incredible mismanagement, terrible writing and lousy direction. I'm not sure where all the blame should sit, and I'm sure fingers could point in many directions, but it's still baffling just how bad it got, and how much better it's gotten thanks to Angela Kang's new leadership.  Another actor present at the convention was Josh McDermitt who plays Eugene and who, as insane as this sounds, probably had the most interesting arc in Season 8, mostly demurred: “I disagree, only because I’m still on the show and like my job,” he said.  Perhaps the most important quote from Cudlitz, or at least the one that speaks to me the most, is this: “It’s like one of those things where you’re so into something and then you’re like, ‘really, guys?’” Cudlitz said. “I get pissed off because I love it.”  I've received so much anger and hate from The Walking Dead fans who said that I was trying to ruin their beloved show, when the whole time I was the one raising the red flags, saying ""Really guys?"" because I am a fan. I am a critic, yes, and it's my job to point out when a show goes astray like this. I feel like finally in Season 9, many of my criticisms of the show have finally been heard and we've seen a remarkable uptick in quality. That's fantastic! (Though now I'm being accused of having turned into a shill or, worse, a taking bribes to say nice things about the show because that's the sad truth about fandom. If you say something critical you're a monster and if you say something nice you're a patsy. Oy vey.)  In any case, bravo to Michael Cudlitz for speaking out. I still wish he'd been the choice for the Fear The Walking Dead crossover, but I think he dodged a bullet there. Or a bat, as the case may be.  As a side note, I think Rick getting killed at the beginning of Season 7 would have been an amazing creative decision and would have, potentially, made for a much more interesting story arc for all involved. Oh well.",1

"For Stephen Colbert and his “Late Night” staff, the best-selling spoof “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” essentially wrote itself.  Because all of the words are by President Donald Trump, who is billed as the author “by accident.” The picture book’s title and contents were inspired by Trump’s disjointed response last September to Hurricane Florence, which struck North Carolina and South Carolina, where Colbert grew up.  “If you love Trump, you’ll love this book because every word in it is exactly what he said,” Colbert, for whom the president has been prime comic material, said during a recent interview with The Associated Press. “And if you’re anti-Trump you’ll love this book because every word in it is exactly what he said.”  “Whose Boat Is This Boat? Comments That Don’t Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane” has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and raised more than $1.25 million for such charities as Foundation for the Carolinas and World Central Kitchen. The contributions come from author proceeds and from the publisher, Simon & Schuster.  Books can take years from conception to publication, but “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves, physical and virtual. It began after Trump visited New Bern, North Carolina, and was preoccupied with a yacht that had landed in a resident’s backyard.  “To see what we’re seeing — this boat. I don’t know what happened, but this boat just came here,” he said. Other comments included “At least you got a nice boat out of the deal” and “Have a good time!”  “Late Show” staff writer Emmy Blotnick heard Trump’s remarks and said, “That sounds like a children’s book.”  With illustrations by Audro Buneta and John Henry, “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” looks like a bedtime story, albeit one that ends with the message “There is no moral.” Defining it has proved challenging: On The New York Times best-seller charts, it appears under “Advice, How-to & Miscellaneous.”  “We should be on the nonfiction list,” Colbert said. “I smell a rat.”  According to a Times spokesperson, “The book was placed on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list where many books that defy easy categorization have ranked. It’s a great achievement being on this highly competitive list for six weeks, including a week at No. 1, and we wish Stephen were happier about it.”  Colbert said the book is for “children of all ages,” one that appeals to kids because it’s “pretty to look at, no nudity, no violence” and one that shows adults how “our president responds” to natural disasters. The book is billed as “an excellent teaching tool” that lets readers learn “about empathy by process of elimination.”  “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” isn’t the first picture story to mock the Trump administration. “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo” is a best-selling parody of “Marlon Bundo’s Day in the Life of a Vice President,” a tribute to the family’s pet bunny written by Mike Pence’s daughter, Charlotte Pence, and illustrated by his wife, Karen Pence. The vice president is known for his conservative social views; in Oliver’s book, Marlon Bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny.  Charlotte Pence herself bought a copy of the Oliver edition, noting that proceeds went to charity. Colbert senses he may have similar luck with Trump and his family.  “What I’m hearing, from the voices inside my head, is that he enjoys it,” Colbert said, mimicking the president’s own fact-checking style. “Everybody is saying he likes it.”",1

"Gabrielle Union is the newest victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time — still, she's not taking any blame for somehow getting sucked into Hollywood's latest scandal.  Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter.  In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it.  ""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""  Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter , and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.  “She’s basically already forgiven him,” a source said. “She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‘cheating’ and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn’t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.”",1

"Together at last! Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus made things official during Monday, June 4, episode of Teen Mom 2. Even though they tried to act like one big happy family with their children, their relationship with Kailyn Lowry couldn’t be worse. Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week’s episode of Teen Mom 2.  Chelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe  It was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter’s last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer’s name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn’t be more nervous to faceher ex, who she hadn’t seen in about a year.  “I hate that I doubt myself,” Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. “Am I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?”  In the end, everything went Chelsea’s way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.  “I just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,” Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.  Briana and Javi are Official  After weeks of beating around the bush, Briana finally admitted that she and Javi were “boyfriend and girlfriend.” She went to Delaware to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday with the kids. She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.  “I’m looking forward to today,” Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. “It’s nice having you by my side,” he told her.  Even though last week’s episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.  When Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln’s party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi’s ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.  “Shut the f—k up cause now I’m mad. S—k my d—k, you dumb bitch,” Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn’t want to meet up with her to talk thing about.  After that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. “I don’t think that she’s a good person,” Kailyn said. “I don’t want anything to do with him.”  Nathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle  Jenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page. However, the change made rumors swirl that she and David Eason were breaking up because her page no longer mentioned they were together. Her ex Nathan Griffith didn’t waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.  “You don’t know s—t about Kaiser. You don’t ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I’m broken up with David,” Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one’s surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was suppose to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David’s mother to avoid drama.  However, Nathan was so made about the texts, he went after David’s mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. “They need to get off the drugs,” Nathan said. “I won’t do this no more.”  Leah Opens Up To Her Daughter  Leah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter’s problems in front of her, which made it awkward.  “It was hard to talk about why you’re not always the nicest to Ali,” Leah told Aleeah afterward. “Even when you have a bad day, I still love you.”  Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

"OMG! Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson were reportedly spotted making out at a restaurant in Los Angeles! Are they a couple?! Get the deets!  Are Katy Perry, 33, and Robert Pattinson, 31, dating? They were reportedly spotted kissing during a group dinner on Jan. 26 at Taix French Restaurant in Los Angeles, a witness told Wonderwall.com. “They were making out,” an onlooker told the website. The witness also added that their behavior made it seem like they were “totally a couple.” Eek! See pictures of Katy and Rob together here.  The Twilight actor ended his engagement to FKA Twigs, 30, in Oct. 2017, and, as we’ve previously reported, he started getting close with the “Swish Swish” singer in the aftermath of the split. “Rob’s been talking and texting with Katy, and they’ve become super super close,” a source close to Rob previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “There’s always been a really strong chemistry between them, and a definite attraction, but they’ve never acted on it, because all the time they’ve known each other one or other of them has been involved with someone else.”  The pair have both been single since his breakup with his former fiancée, but Rob didn’t immediately try to start a new relationship last fall out of respect. “There’s no doubt that he’s really into Katy, and that he fancies her like crazy, but, he’s determined to not get in to some kind of rebound romance — he respects and cares about Katy way too much to risk blowing the friendship they currently have,” our insider added. The American Idol judge was last romantically involved with Orlando Bloom, 41, but they ended their relationship in Feb. 2017. While nothing is confirmed yet on whether or not Rob and Katy are ~official~ we’ll be holding our breath until we find out more about this blossoming romance!

The newlyweds tied the knot during a romantic beachside wedding in Curacao on Sunday, May 14, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.

"It took Kelly Ripa more than a year to find the right co-host for Live after Michael Strahan unexpectedly left for Good Morning America. Now, her incredible chemistry with Strahan’s replacement, Ryan Seacrest, is undeniable, but in the midst of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Ripa is feeling betrayed and torn about standing beside him. Could these skeletons in Seacrest’s closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?  According to Life & Style, in the era of the #MeToo and #Time’sUp movements every business is playing it safe, and that means things could change at Live, especially if ratings start to drop and big names start to avoid the show.  “[Kelly’s] waiting to see what happens with Ryan. But [either way] this is a dark period for her,” reveals an insider. “She’s pissed…Kelly feels blindsided. The last thing she needs is celebrities boycotting. Everyone is on pins and needles.”  At this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasn’t the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.  This resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.  Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn’t mean she still isn’t conflicted about the allegations.  She does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.  Ripa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser’s head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.  But, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.  Oscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.

"Postby Guest » Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",0
"Follow­ing therap­y, actor has come to realis­e that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

"The clock is ticking for ABC’s ‘American Idol’ reboot to find two more judges to join Katy Perry. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how producers have their eyes on Selena Gomez to join the show.  It would be pretty awkward to see Taylor Swift‘s BFF Selena Gomez, 25, sitting next to arch-enemy Katy Perry, 32, week after week on American Idol, but the “Fetish” singer is at the top of the show producers’ wish-list for judges. “Producers think that Selena would be great to join the judging panel because she’d bring in a younger crowd for ratings, she’d be considered the nice judge and they would love her to join because the impact she has with social media,” an AI insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Sel is the most followed person on Instagram with a whopping 127 million followers, so of course the show would love to have a judge who can reach so many people.  “They are putting together a proposal for her and are hoping she will accept it and join the show, it’s a long shot but they are taking the chance to get her. They’d love to have her signed up and all judges by mid October,” our insider adds. So far the show has been striking out right and left when it comes to getting other stars to join Katy on the panel. ABC reportedly spent a whopping $25 million to land her back in May, which is over half of the show’s budget. As a result, they don’t have much money left over to get other top names. After all, who wants to do the same job as Katy for a fraction of the paycheck? Especially in Selena’s case, she is the bigger star these days! See pics of beautiful Selena, right here.  If by some chance Selena actually agrees to join the show, they definitely need a “nice” judge cause Katy said she won’t be holding back when it comes to the contestants’ talent. She called in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Aug. 23, to give her judging strategy. “I’m going to maybe be more the Simon Cowell. I really respect him. As much as people said, ‘Oh, he’s grumpy or he’s mean,’ he was just truthful, you know? He’s seen it. I don’t need to be there to win the popular race.” She added, “Honestly sob stories come second for me. Everyone has a situation and God bless them…but if you don’t have the goods, you don’t have the goods.” Brutal!    HollywoodLifers, do you think it would be a good career move for Selena to join American Idol? Or would be it be a big step down?",0

He has subsequently appeared in many films including the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, ""Elizabethtown"", and ""New York, I Love You"", and many more.  Born Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom on January 13 1977, in Canterbury, Kent, England, he first entered the limelight in 2001 as the elf-prince Legolas in The Lord of the Rings. He made his breakthrough as the dashing elf warrior in the first movie of Peter Jackson's triology: ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001). After the overwhelming success of the sequels, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" (2002) and ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003), Bloom became one of the brightest young stars in Hollywood. Having proved already that he is good with franchises, Orlando jumped ship to star with Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" (2003).

"It is an undeniable fact that Miranda Kerr has incredible skin. Not only is it always glowing and radiant, but her pores are virtually non-existent, she has an even skin tone and she doesn’t seem to have had a pimple in years.  So, it is understandable that when the model and founder of skin care brand KORA Organics shared her top skin care tips with Teen Vogue, including the product she uses to clear her blemishes overnight, we were all ears.  According to the model, facial oils are her go-to when confronted with a surprise pimple. “If I’m having a breakout, I like to balance the pH of my skin with my Noni Glow Oil. I find that really helps, even with treating it overnight. I put it on after cleansing, misting, exfoliating and moisturising,” she said.  While we’re not debating the effectiveness the oil has on Miranda’s skin, we wanted to check in with a skin care expert to find out if facial oils can work as an effective pimple treatment for the rest of us. And if the advice from Bryan Barron Director of Research and Content at Paula’s Choice, is anything to go by, it isn’t good news.  In fact, Barron says, “While some people report success using oils to banish breakouts, mounds of research has shown that gently removing excess oil and controlling acne-causing bacteria with benzoyl peroxide, and using a leave-on exfoliant with salicylic acid is a proven, reliable approach for acne at any age.”  Ultimately, while facial oils are a vital addition in any skin care routine as they work wonders to nourish, plump and hydrate the skin, using them as a pimple treatment may not deliver the same results as the proven acne treatment duo of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.

"Postby Guest » Wed May 02, 2018 1:05 pm  By Andrew Shuster | 3:29 pm, May 1, 2018    A tabloid report claiming Brad Pitt is seeking advice from George Clooney on his supposed romance with Neri Oxman is completely made-up. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn’t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.    According to Woman’s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney’s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.    As the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “George loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It’s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.”    The outlet’s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been “advising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt “is very grateful” for Amal because “he’s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.”    The tabloid’s article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt’s rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn’t dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a “professional friendship,” as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends.”    This article only seems to exist because Woman’s Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal’s imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren’t a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor’s friend hasn’t turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.    It’s worth noting, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend’s love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue.",0
"The ABC reality star and fiancee Lauren Burnham plan to marry in January — but ABC viewers aren't invited.  One day after his ex-fiancee announced that she is now engaged, former Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. revealed that he and Lauren Burnham have set a wedding date.  ""We're getting married in Hawaii on Jan. 12 next year,"" Burnham, with Luyendyk by her side, announced on The View Wednesday. ""If we were able to get married tomorrow, we would. We're just ready for that next step.""  The pair — who just bought a new house in Scottsdale, Ariz., where Luyendyk, a race car driver and real estate broker, is based — have booked Maui's Haiku Mill for the nontelevised event. ""It's a private wedding, so not on TV,"" he confirmed. ""Just a close group of friends, probably 100 guests.""  As ABC's most-recent Bachelor, Luyendyk became one of the most controversial stars of the long-running franchise when he swapped his final pick. After he proposed to an accepting Becca Kufrin on the pretaped March 5 episode, it was revealed on the post-finale After the Final Rose special that Luyendyk had changed his mind.  After a two-month engagement, Luyendyk called off his relationship with Kufrin during a difficult-to-watch on-camera breakup that played out unedited and ran for nearly an hour. He then turned around and proposed a second time on live television to Burnham, who accepted.  ""Going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn't a popular decision,"" Luyendyk explained, ""but it was a decision I had to make for myself. At the end of the day, it's a TV show but this is the rest of our lives, and Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with.""  The choices made by Luyendyk and producers to ambush Kufrin, and by ABC to air the breakup footage, sent backlash Luyendyk's way and turned off some fans of the franchise. Think pieces and takedowns ran in the week that followed and as Kufrin accepted her new role as the next star of The Bachelorette, Luyendyk and Burnham largely disappeared from the spotlight, choosing to keep viewers updated on their relationship via their social media channels.  On Wednesday, the pair said neither of them has watched the finale to this day.  ""They say it was unedited but it was edited,"" said Luyendyk. ""[As the Bachelor,] you are not in the editing room and you can't really control what they show.""  He added, ""Going into it, the biggest reason why I wanted it to be filmed was so that everyone could see the story. Not only the good things but also the bad things. Just because [with] the finale, there's always a lot of questions. When [former Bachelor] Jason Mesnick changed his mind — he's happy and has kids and a great life — they didn't film anything and fans were upset by that. I really wanted everyone to see our love story and I think the editing chose to show more of the breakup than the happy parts of that ending.""  Burnham admitted that she knew Luyendyk was going to break up with Kufrin, but that filming the heartbreaks are part of what they signed up for.  ""I knew he was going to break up with Becca and I knew that production was involved, so I kind of figured that's what was happening,"" she said. ""But the whole thing was taped. My breakup was taped and everyone else's was, that's kind of the name of the game.""  Unlike a handful of successful Bachelor couples to come before them, Luyendyk and Burnham are opting to not invite ABC's cameras to their big day. The Bachelor franchise has aired five TV weddings, including original Bachelorette Trista and Ryan Sutter's and former Bachelor Sean and Catherine Lowe's.  When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter after the finale in March, the couple had said they hoped to set a date later in the year. At the time, they both said they were open to the idea of a TV wedding, but Luyendyk had added, ""I think it’s more about if it works in our timeline.""  Luyendyk's and Burnham's live TV appearance — their first since a whirlwind post-finale press week — comes days before Kufrin begins her Bachelorette journey Monday.  When asked about the curious timing, Burnham replied with a laugh, ""Honestly, I don't think we really had much control over that."" Luyendyk added, ""Our plan just came together so it just happens to be the timing of things. We're excited to do it privately because everyone asks us, so we were like: Why not just come on here and tell everybody?""  Though Burnham played coy about whether or not she has spoken to Kufrin or if they will appear on the upcoming season, Luyendyk had a solid answer when asked if he would do anything differently: ""It's hard to live in regret. Because of how things ended, I think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn't change it.""  Viewers have been particularly invested in Kufrin's happily ever after ever since she was subjected to the on-camera breakup, and on Tuesday, she revealed that she does in fact find love at the end of her journey, which wrapped filming weeks ago.  ""I'm engaged!"" she told People. ""I still pinch myself, like, did that all just happen? It’s been a whirlwind.""  Adding, ""It feels so good to say it and this time, I think it's going to stick!""

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again.""",1
"ONE Direction star Zayn Malik has split from supermodel Gigi Hadid, The Sun’s Bizarre column can reveal.  The £45 million couple – who were rumoured to be engaged – had been one of the showbiz world’s most glamorous couples for 28 months.  12 Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid have split  But Zayn, 25, and Gigi, 22, gradually drifted apart, due in part to work pressures, causing them to officially break up earlier this month.  Last night a source close to couple revealed: “Sadly Zayn and Gigi have separated.  “They are no longer a couple but they do remain close and are supportive of each other.  “The reality is that they’ve grown apart, having been together for a long time.

The source added: “This is definitely the end for now, but this isn’t a bitter split and they both have respect for each other.  “It’s a mutual decision so no one has completely ruled out a reunion in the future, but for now that’s not where their heads are at.”  The couple, who posed together for a Vogue photoshoot last July, had increasingly spent time apart.  Bradford-born Zayn, who now lives in Los Angeles, flew out to Florida at the end of February for a holiday while Gigi was working at Paris Fashion Week.  Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid walk hand-in-hand  Zayn started dating Gigi in November 2015, three months after he ended his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards, 24.  She had also split up with US pop heartthrob Joe Jonas, 28, just weeks before they got together.  The former 1D singer introduced himself to Gigi at a Victoria’s Secret party and asked her on a date during their first meeting.  The model then appeared in the video for his first single after quitting Simon Cowell’s boyband, the raunchy Pillowtalk, in January 2016.  After four years in 1D and a successful solo album, Zayn has a fortune of £35million while Gigi is worth an estimated £9.5million.  They made their first red carpet appearance together at the Met Gala in May that year.  She was also his rock during his struggle with anxiety and was with him in London in 2016 when he pulled out of Capital’s Summertime Ball, minutes before he was due to headline.

"After hearing the news that American Idol would be returning to TV next year, we were full of questions: Who would the next judges be? Would J.Lo continue to serve up amazing glam moments? Would Ryan Seacrest give up his spot at Live with Kelly?  Nevertheless, we were giddy with excitement, and since the announcement that Katy Perry would take one of the coveted judge's seats for the new season, our enthusiasm was brought to a whole other level. Perry seems pretty thrilled by the news too, and the ""Bon Appetit"" singer's reported $25 million paycheck (and what would be the biggest salary in the show's history), according to TMZ, is the cherry on the cake (or in the pie?).  The news came up during Perry's appearance on 103.5 KTU with Carolina Bermudez on Tuesday. The radio show host asked the songstress if it bothers her that the entire Internet is talking about how much she's getting paid for the gig, and Perry had the perfect response for any naysayers: ""I'm really proud that, as a woman, I got paid,"" she said. ""And you know why? I got paid like more than like pretty much any guy that's been on that show. And, by the way, I love men. So I'm a paid woman and I'm ready for a beautiful man.""  No matter how big the payout, Perry's ultimate goal is finding America's next rising star. ""This show is about finding real talent, making peoples' dreams come true and additionally hearing their stories,"" she said. ""I want to see you. I want to hear you. I want to witness you.""

"On this week’s episode of “The Bachelorette,” a male model claimed to have a 100 percent swipe-to-match success rate on Tinder, and a guy who showed up in a chicken suit broke his face by falling out of a bunk bed.  You can’t make this stuff up.  The two (highly entertaining, somewhat delightful) doofuses in question are Jordan Kimball, a male model from Florida, and David Ravitz, a venture capitalist from New Jersey. Seeds of an impending feud were planted at the beginning of the season, and now that we’re at Week 3, it’s revving up. It’s unclear exactly why they hate each other so much, but the enmity is real, and it’s reality television gold.  During a group date, male model Jordan claims to have gotten more than 4,000 matches on Tinder during 2017. He also says that every woman he swipes right on also swipes right on him ― hence the 100 percent swipe-to-match rate. (HuffPost reached out to Tinder to fact check these claims but did not hear back.)  I am ashamed to admit that I was one of Jordan from #theBachlorette ‘s 4000 tinder matches 🤦🏼‍♀️ — Cassie Livingston (@heyitscassie13) June 12, 2018  David continues to needle Jordan about his Tinder habits until the Wilhemina model cracks and delivers a monologue of epic proportions.  “You think I’m a joke. I’m a Wilhemina model,” he says. “I don’t think you know what that means. I have an image. If you’re trying to tear down my image and my three-year contract ... it’s actually pretty serious. It’s something some people consider the top.... If you’re trying to wreck my image, you’ll never succeed. Because, do you know why? Because my image is me.”  HuffPost’s Emma Gray chatted all about Jordan and David with actress and “Bachelor” fan Erin Darke on the “Here to Make Friends” podcast:  Gray: So Jordan makes a few claims on this group date. One, he claims he got a notification from Tinder that he got 4,000 matches in 2017. My colleague Maxwell is emailing Tinder to fact-check these claims. (Update: We did not hear back from Tinder.) But I’ve never heard of such a notification. Maybe it does exist, and I guess if you’re swiping on tons of people every day of the year, it wouldn’t be that hard to get 4,000 matches. You’d have to get 10-12 matches a day.  Darke: But you’re talking about every day.  Gray: And Jordan says he didn’t [use Tinder] every day. He also says he’s very selective.  Darke: There’s no way you get 4,000 matches if you’re very selective. Those things are in opposition.  Gray: But there’s an even more wild claim that Jordan makes. David is just needling him and he says, “What do you think your match percentage is, Jordan?” And Jordan says, “100 percent.”  Anyone who has online-dated knows that’s a wild claim. The algorithm [of Tinder and similar apps] intentionally serves you people who haven’t matched you mixed in with people who have. Because it’s a game! I don’t believe anyone has a perfect swipe-to-match rate. Unless you’ve only swiped on one person.  Darke: But apparently Jordan’s swiped on 4,000! Also, what a weird thing to bring up on a date, and then to brag about and then to lie about!  Gray: And then, of course, David is just a little shit-stirrer. I know a lot of people are kind of down on David, but I’m still sort of into him. I feel like I know people like him.  Darke: I also feel like if I was stuck in a house with literally nothing to do with Jordan for weeks, it would be really hard not to play with him.  Gray: Yeah. It’s not the kindest way to act, but... And I do think [Jordan] will ultimately be David’s undoing. But, for now, I’m enjoying it.  Darke: I am, too. It makes for great TV.  Gray: David’s also so transparent. He goes to Becca and says, “I’m not one to throw people under the bus, but...”  Darke: “I don’t throw people under the bus, but there is a bus coming and Jordan has a date with it.”  Gray: And then Becca, who obviously is not into Jordan, just goes up to him and is like, “Jordan, 4,000 matches, eh?” And Jordan just becomes enraged. Meanwhile, Wills has fully burrowed into the couch by that point.  Darke: He was trying to make himself a part of the furniture.  Gray: But Jordan talks to Becca and explains that he’s like a golden retriever as a partner. He’s loyal, he’s dependable and he loves a good girls’ day! I mean... good qualities.  Darke: But I also feel like he had a weird pause in that speech. First he said, “I cook, I clean, I am a golden retriever.” And then there was a pause. And then he was like, “I’m loyal.” I was watching it wondering if he thinks cooking and cleaning are golden retriever qualities?  Gray: He grew up with a very intelligent golden retriever.  Darke: Oh, I enjoy him so much.  For more on “The Bachelorette,” listen to “Here to Make Friends”:",1

"“ Speaking of power, let me ask you a question. Prime Minister, does this sound ceremonial to you? [CROWD CHANTING] “Long live the King! Long live the King!” — Robert proves the power of the Monarchy to the Parliament ”      King Robert Simon Henstridge is the current king of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms who replaced his uncle Cyrus as king after a Privy Council vote.  Until Season 3, Robert was thought to have died in a plane crash, but instead was found to be alive on a deserted island.  He is Willow's husband, whom he married at the end of Season 4.  Contents show]  Character Edit  King Robert is the firstborn son of the late King Simon Henstridge and Queen Helena Henstridge. He is also the older brother of fraternal twins Prince Liam Henstridge and Princess Eleanor Henstridge. He was the favorite nephew of Prince Cyrus and he is his mother's favorite child as well. It is well known that he is especially close with his younger sister Eleanor and she felt a tremendous amount of guilt for not calling him the day of his accident.  We found out his supposed 'death' wasn't an accident, as he was targeted. He was 'killed' by Brandon Boone. Boone was ordered by Ted Pryce to have him shot, but he failed, and Robert remained alive, as revealed at the end of Season 2.He is an evil son of bitch.  According to most of the accounts of Robert's character during the first two seasons, it is known that he was well-groomed by his parents to take over as king someday. He understood his duty much better than his younger siblings, who tend to prefer partying to ruling. His best friend, Twysden 'Beck' Beckwith, was the man who took Eleanor's virginity and was her first love.  He is surviving on the island with only his crashed plane and an old antique knife that was once his father's. In Season 3, Episode 1, he scrapes ""HRH"" off of his flight helmet, indicating that he may be happier in his new life not being the Crown Prince.  He had a girlfriend, Kathryn Davis, whom we find out is the girl Liam has developed feelings for at the beginning of Season 3. Robert has a hallucination of Kathryn asking what he wants at the end of Season 3 Episode 2. This is what eventually leads to him to shoot his flare and thus get rescued.  He destroyed Eleanor’s letter to Jasper, believing Jasper isn’t good enough for her. He is very cruel to Liam, when he got home he saw Liam and Kathryn share a kiss. He didn’t mention it however and he kept Kathryn as a girlfriend before breaking up with her in the final episode of Season 3. He calls her a whore and reveals that he knew about the relationship between her and Liam.  He takes a romantic interest in Willow, who is Liam's close friend, at the end of Season 3.  It is revealed in a flashback in 3x10, that Simon planned to disband the monarchy because he did not believe Robert would make a good king. Robert keeps this fact to himself.  Personality Edit  He is very smart, manipulative and disciplined, taking after his mother. He and Liam are very competitive. Robert often calls Liam “Sparrow,"" a reminder that he is the younger brother and spare son.  Robert is ruthless, cunning, charming and polite. He conducts himself gracefully and respectfully in public, which he seems to have inherited from his father. However, he has shown that he can be exceptionally deceitful and arrogant just like his uncle Cyrus.      Season 1 Edit  Season 1 opens up with King Simon being told that Robert's plane has been shot down and his eldest son is now dead. The family is in disarray as the line of succession has changed and Liam (who is next in line to the British throne) is unprepared to rule. Each member of the family deals with Robert's 'death' differently and Simon announces plans to disband the monarchy (presumably because Liam and Eleanor would not make good heirs to the throne).  Throughout the season, Robert is praised for being the most responsible and most respectful of the three children. He was also known to support many local charities. Liam and Eleanor take over many of his charitable duties when he is presumed dead.  In 1x09, Simon remains in critical condition after he is stabbed by an unknown assailant late one night. This event prompts Eleanor to look closer into Robert's accident and at one point she even accuses her mother of killing him. Eleanor and Marcus investigate a mystery man (Brandon Boone) who appears on the palace surveillance tapes. Boone confronts Eleanor at the hospital and tells her that he 'killed' Robert. He also told her that she is not safe.  Jasper and Eleanor go to meet Boone in 1x10. He explains he was paid to take to crash Robert's plane using a drone to control it. Boone's Major apparently got calls from the palace to do this and is now missing. Boone expresses regret and says that the fake suicide note that was found was indeed forged. He assures them that he had nothing to do with the attack on Simon.  Season 2 Edit  Jasper is the first one to discover the truth about Robert's accident and Simon's murder in 2x09 by obtaining video footage of the latter event.  It is revealed that Ted Pryce and Jeffrey Stuart planned to kill both Simon and Robert in retaliation for the wrongs that the Royal Family have committed against them. Pryce blames the monarchy for the death of his wife Daphne. Stuart blames Helena and the Grand Duchess for the death of his sister, Dominique (who was a rival for Simon's affections many years prior).  Season 3 Edit  In Season 3 Episode 1, Robert is surviving on the island with only his crashed plane, a flare and an old antique knife that was once his father's. He is seen scraping ""HRH"" off of his flight helmet, indicating that he may be happier in his new life not being the Crown Prince.  A boat passes Robert many times, but he refuses to signal for help in 3x02. It appears that he is not ready to return to his previous life and face the public scrutiny. He has hallucinations of Eleanor confronting him about not coming home sooner and Kathryn Davis (whom we later find out is his secret girlfriend) asks him what he wants. He then signals the boat and is rescued.  In 3x03, Eleanor and the Queen are walking late one night in the palace when across the hall they spot Robert who has returned. Shocked to see her brother, Eleanor faints. The Queen shortly faints as well.  At the start of Our (Late) Dear Brother's Death, we see the family, Robert comforting them and telling them about how he got home. He jokes to Eleanor as she wakes up, ""you always did make everything about you."" Queen Helena is trying to make sense of the situation and orders tea. Robert asks his mother join him and his sister on the couch. The three embrace, overjoyed by the moment. Cyrus walks in on the family reunion, still drunk and defeated from the news that Helena has DNA proof that her children are the rightful heirs to the throne. He scoffs, not quite comprehending it's the real Robert. When Robert let's him know it's truly him, Cyrus coldly and bluntly lets his nephew know that his father passed away before leaving the room.  Robert then receives the files on his and his father's deaths along with a hard drive with the graphic video of his father's murder. Robert sits down and begins catching up on everything he's missed. The news of his father's death overwhelms him. Next, he is in front of a bathroom mirror and begins to shave his beard with a golden razor and proper shaving cream. He recalls the challenge and struggle of shaving on the island with just his father's knife.  When Liam returns to the palace, he rushes to meet his brother, who is now clean shaven and in a suit. The two brother's embrace once reunited. They are sitting in the throne room talking about their father. Robert remembers his father's last words to him but doesn't want to share them with Liam. Liam receives a text from Kathryn with whom he had spent the night. He tells her he needs to explain the situation to her in person.  Helena and her three children discuss how to handle Robert's return. She wants to control the story and advises Eleanor and Liam to go about business as usual. The family decides to announce Robert's return during the press conference scheduled to reveal Liam and Eleanor as Simon's true heirs. Helena then asks Robert how many people know about his rescues. He explains MI6, a few admins, and four military extractors know he returned but that they can be trusted. Throughout the family meeting, Liam continues to receive texts from Kathryn. Robert is surprised and shocked to learn his mother schemed to have his siblings removed from the line of succession, and Helena admits it wasn't one of her finest moments. She then asks Robert if he wants a speech writer to help him prepare what he'll say but then smiles, remembering her son always had a natural way with words. Eleanor breaks out smiling stating she can't believe they are all together. The family then calls Liam out for texting throughout the entire meeting.  Robert walks through the hall and overhears Eleanor's preliminary interview with Vanity Fair. He is impressed to see his little sister has grown up while he was away and come into her own when it comes to helping promote the royal image. Jasper then bursts into Eleanor's room, and she tries awkwardly to cover up their relationship by passing him off as a lost guard looking for Liam.  Robert is in his old room getting ready to look at the flash drive given to him by the head of security when Helena comes to visit him. She tells him his things are in storage and can be brought up but he refuses, saying he just needs a bed and one thing he needs to pull out of storage: ""Mum, please relax. You thought I was dead. There's no need to apologize... It's what I want –– something simple really. I just need one of those things from those boxes. Other than that, I'll I need is that bed. I've done more thinking on that island than I'd care to admit."" He then learns Lucius has also left the household while he was away. He asks his mother if she at least had Alistair's company and she lets him know they no longer speak. Robert tells his mother she must have been lonely all this time, and she tells him no one feels sorry for the royal family. Once she leaves, he looks at the video on the flash drive and begins to cry as he sees his father murdered. He then searches online for reactions to the news and the public riots that followed. He sees a video clip of Liam speaking kindly about Robert at his funeral. Robert then sees the #kingliam movement and how popular his brother has become.  A reporter visits the queen and tells her he knows Robert has returned, and he is going to publish the story with or without a comment from her. Robert walks in and convinces Mr. Krenshaw to wait for the press conference in exchange for a quote from him. Helena beams as she watches her firstborn son expertly maneuver the media.  Robert goes out on the grounds with Liam and retrieves an old bottle of whiskey their father kept hidden in a tree. They drink together and pour a drink on the ground for their father. Robert admits to his brother he's having a hard time processing the news that their father is gone before asking Liam about the girl he's been texting all day. Liam avoids his questions. Robert then asks Liam to join him for a walk later that night.  Robert walks in on Eleanor talking to Jasper about how they'll explain their relationship to him. Robert learns Jasper is American, and Eleanor begins praising Jasper as the one who discovered the truth behind their father's death. She then awkwardly lets out that Jasper is also her boyfriend. Robert shakes Jasper's hand and then tells him he has high standards for whomever dates his sister but is impressed already with Jasper since he is the one that found out the truth about the murders.  Later that evening, Robert and Liam are on their walk through the town and a little tipsy. Robert ask Liam what he thinks of Jasper and then comments on how surprised he is that Liam and Eleanor no longer argue and fight like they used to. Liam explains that it was expected since he and his sister were kids and shared the same birthday. He says Robert's death brought them closer together. He then laments that his brother always took Eleanor's side. Robert explains that Eleanor was his sister and needed someone to look out for her, and Liam sadly notes that he is also Robert's sibling. Before Liam realizes where they are going, Robert is on Kathryn's street. Kathryn is shocked to see Robert and Robert assures her he is alive and expects nothing from her. He only wanted her to hear from him that he is back and that he missed her. Liam hangs back and watches the reunion.  The next morning, Robert is dressed in his military uniform and visits his father's grave with Eleanor. She apologizes for never calling him back the night before he disappeared. She explains the guilt has been eating away at her, and he reassures her she had no need to feel guilty because he doesn't even remember the missed call. He lets her know she seems to be a good place now and then recalls their father had a lot of expectations for all of them. He says he is proud of her. Eleanor asks him if he likes Jasper, and Robert can only smile and let her know that he likes that she is happy.  At the press conference, Queen Helena announces Liam and Eleanor are Simon's children. As the media asks when Liam will ascend the throne, Helena states someone else will finish answering their questions. Robert walks out before the press. He explains to them how his plane was remotely hijacked and how he survived on the island. He assures the media he is emotionally and mentally ready to lead the country and is happy to get back to his own bed.  However, later that night as the palace rests, Robert does not seem fine. He retrieves an item from his belongings in storage and then returns to his room. Rather than sleep in his own bed, he lies down on the floor with a small hour glass by his side. The trauma from the island is still with him.  Flashbacks of Liam and Robert first meeting Kathryn at her father’s pub parallel reveal Liam’s guilt for dating his brother’s girlfriend. Although Liam flirted with Kathryn, Robert called bagsy (the British equivalent of dibs) and that was that. Robert and Kathryn fell in love behind the prying eyes of the public.  Season 3 Episode 5, has Robert presently enjoying his homecoming celebrations and spending time with Kathryn who has yet to have a talk with Liam about what to do now that Robert has returned. Robert takes Kathryn out on a picnic and explains that he has no expectations of her, but wants her to know that he misses her and wishes to pick up where they left off.  Helena urges Cyrus to hand the crown over to Robert, but Cyrus reminds her that Robert is still legally dead and may be mentally unstable because of his time on the island. Robert takes the opportunity to manipulate Cyrus into leaving it to the Privy Council to decide their fates, while convincing him that it was his idea. The two reminisce about Cyrus giving Robert his first drink and Robert praises him for his battle against cancer and for being a good person to confide in when Simon was being too tough on him.  Robert informs Liam that he will be taking over his charity work during a rigged game of darts. While on the balcony, Robert steals the first wave from Cyrus and gives Liam an awkward hug. Liam still seems bitter about their earlier encounters.  It's Christmas in 3x06 and the palace is chaotic when Liam lets the staff go home early. Robert agrees with Helena, that Liam should not have done that without properly planning it out first.  Robert runs into Jasper at the family gym and reminds him to know his place. Robert also lets him know that he is looking into his past.  Robert then confronts Cyrus about sending expensive, engraved wine bottles to the members of the Privy Council, in an attempt to bribe them to vote in his favor. Robert reminds Cyrus that, ""I played chess with my father. You’d be wise to remember that.”  Robert escorts a drunk Cyrus to bed, while Liam (who's looking for a fight) confronts him about how much he knows about Jasper's past. When Liam comes to Jasper's defense, Robert continuously refers to him by his code name 'Sparrow,' which aggravates him even further. At dinner, Robert gives a concise toast and Liam criticizes Robert's self-righteousness in his follow-up toast. The two argue about who should give the annual Christmas address. In the end, Eleanor gives it and wears the late Simon's watch during the broadcast. Liam visits Robert's room at the end of the night, where Robert is playing with a small hourglass. Liam gives him the boxing gloves Simon left to him. Liam says that Simon would have wanted Robert to have them, if he knew that Robert was still alive. Liam then challenges him to a boxing match for charity and says he will win the gloves back.  At the People's Charity Gala in 3x07, Beck chats with Robert and they prepare for the upcoming match. Helena reprimands Robert for not talking to the young ladies she invited, and tell him that she wishes to compile a list of suitable brides for him. Robert responds that lists are only for men who don't know what they want. When she reminds him that she was on Simon's list, he harshly says, ""and look how that turned out."" Helena is hurt and he retracts by saying, ""sorry, that was unfair."" They agree that if Helena participates in the auction (and makes a sacrifice for the family), then he will give her list a fair consideration.  Willow is tasked with complying the list and approaches Robert with a series of questions to help her with the process. Initially, Robert appears bored with the encounter, but slowly warms to Willow's wit and charm. He smiles as he watches her walk away.  Robert unveils(the charity that he took over from Liam) and gives Eleanor credit for hosting the gala, but no credit to Liam or Willow for founding the charity.Kathryn and her older sister, Angie, attend the Gala. Angie buys Kathryn an auction ticket. After some deliberation, she puts her ticket into Robert's box and wins. After it is announced that Kathryn won, Robert makes a very public display of affection by meeting Kathryn in the crowd, kissing her hand, complimenting her, and taking a photo with her. Robert planned it so that she would win the wine cellar tour with him. That way, the press sees the two of them together, they could publish a 'Cinderella story.'  Once they are alone, Kathryn learns from Robert that he had tasted a 1962 Bordeaux even though he had told her otherwise when they first met. He only used that to get to know her better.  Before the boxing match, Cyrus places his bet on Liam, promising to double his donation to Gratitude Forever if Liam wins. Robert seems to have this win in the bag as Liam lays on the floor of the ring, but then Liam remembers his dad’s note in the Christmas present; he remembers that his dad told him to always keep going. So Liam gets back up and takes Robert out.  Later, Robert says, “We gave them a good show.” Since the fight was for charity, Robert had set it all up. Liam didn’t actually beat Robert. Liam decides to try to take his brother on right then and there, but Robert keeps knocking Liam down. Robert says he will continue to do so because he loves him. Kathryn and Robert leave Liam bloodied and bruised.  In Season 3 Episode 8, Liam apologizes to Robert and the two make up with a hug. Robert promises to talk to Liam later. Robert goes out with Kathryn and talks about leaving the monarchy and growing old with her. He is approached again by Liam later in the day, who tells him that he is ready and willing to be king if only Robert would step aside. Robert apologizes for not realizing the extent of Liam's personal growth in his absence and offers to put Liam's name forward to the Privy Council instead, but only if Helena agrees.  When they approach Helena, she is vehemently opposed to the idea and adamantly tells Liam that this is, ""Robert's time... this has always been Robert's destiny."" She thereby destroys Liam's hopes of becoming king, and he leaves defeated. It turns out that this was all planned by Robert; he knew exactly what his mother was going to say. He would have never really supported Liam becoming king. Helena is disgusted by Robert's antics and for making her the 'bad guy'. Robert stresses that this was the only way that Liam would stop pursuing the crown and he needed to hear those things from Helena. Helena reluctantly agrees.  In O, Farewell, Honest Soldier, the family prepares for the Privy Council meeting. The night before, Robert stares at Big Ben from a park bench. Big Ben is important to Robert, because if the Privy Council decides in his favor, Big Ben will ring. If there is silence, then Cyrus remains the King of England. Kathryn meets him there the morning of the decision to ask him whether he’s ready. He assures her that he has been ready his whole life.  He asks Liam to tarnish Cyrus' character in order to secure the crown. Liam does not think it is the best plan and suggests that Robert give a invigorating, inspiring speech about how great England is instead. Robert calls his little brother’s perspective naive. Eleanor wishes her brother luck before the meeting of the Council by giving him Simon’s watch. Helena obviously sees this as an opportunity to use the watch to Robert’s advantage since it was widely seen in Eleanor's Christmas address. He could reach for it when he speaks and that will mean something to the Privy Council.  Jasper turns himself in for stealing classified information about Robert's plane crash and is about to be arrested. At the last minute, Robert comes to the rescue and lies that Jasper was secretly working for him. Jasper avoids jail time and after he is fired by James Hill, he accepts Robert's offer to be his personal security detail (on the condition that he stay away from Eleanor).  Standing before the Privy Council, Helena and Eleanor give speeches supporting Robert and denouncing Cyrus. Liam's speech is fairly neutral and does not tarnish Cyrus' reputation. Robert speaks last and gives an impassioned and moving speech about the what is in the best interest for the country moving forward. Back at the palace, Robert harshly criticizes Liam's speech, saying it may cost him the crown, but Liam insists he was protecting the family's reputation. Robert says that if they lose, there will be no more fighting and he will not appeal the decision (like Helena would like to do).At midnight, Big Ben chimes and Robert is now set to become the next king. After quick congratulations all around, he sneaks off to Kathryn's place and the two have sex. When she wakes up, all she sees is a King Robert mask next to her.  In the Season 3 finale, the Royal Family prepares for Robert's coronation. Robert has Simon's portrait taken down and tells Eleanor that it should be in a museum inspiring other people. She tells him that she wants the portrait to remain in the palace, as it inspires her and is a way to keep their father close.  Eleanor also finds out that Robert invited Prince Sebastian Idrisi to the People's Gala. She accuses Robert of setting her up without telling her. Robert deflects by saying Sebastian is ""kind and drama free"" and he thought she would appreciate spending time with someone like that. He also states that had she known about the setup, she never would have given Idrisi a chance.  Robert is already making plans for his new room, taking measurements while Cyrus is still living in it. Cyrus is obviously appalled by this and thinks he is being put on the curb already. Robert says there is a way for Cyrus to stay in the palace by telling him, “Find a purpose, dear uncle. Otherwise, you’re gone.”  Liam actually flies to the island where Robert was stranded for seven months and brings back Robert’s flight helmet to confront his brother. Liam reveals that he knows that the boat that saved Robert came by several times before Robert signaled for help. A furious Robert goes on about how Liam was living a life of luxury while he was alone and stranded.  Robert wants Liam to admit his hatred for him. But Liam doesn’t budge. He wishes Robert had come back sooner and didn’t have to go through their father’s death alone. “I hate that you didn’t come back,” Liam says, “Because while you were hiding on that island, like that damn coward that you are, I was here watching dad die.”  Robert responds,“Don’t you mean letting him die?” Robert spits back. “Or more specifically, letting him get stabbed while you fondled the help.” Liam lunges for Robert and pushes him to the ground. Jasper steps in to break up the fight. Robert lets Liam know that Jasper works for him now.Robert disproves of Helena's relationship with Spencer Hoenigsberg when he sees them embracing. Shortly before the coronation, he tells her that Hoenigsberg has been dismissed. When Helena protests, he states that he has the right because he is the King of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. Liam confronts Robert before the family goes out onto the balcony and informs them that he will not be by Robert's side. Robert gives him a Judas kiss and lets him go.  A series of flashbacks reveal secrets about Robert's past. Robert found the letter that Eleanor had left for Jasper in 3x06. He burns it and calls Jasper's father, thereby telling him to sell the story of his son's relationship with the princess to the press. These series of events leads Jasper to break up with Eleanor in 3x07, and indirectly gets him fired by James Hill.  Robert sleeps with Kathryn after the Privy Council meeting and confesses that she was the reason he came back. He then breaks up with her. When questioned further, Robert reveals that the day he came back, he saw Liam kiss Kathryn outside her flat. Robert is angry that she never told him the truth about their relationship. Kathryn asks why he continued to see her if he knew the truth and he responds, ""Well let's face it, you're quite the whore in bed. I think it's the common blood in you, but you should probably ask Liam."" He also gives her a Judas kiss and walks away.  Earlier that day, he asks to speak with Willow and tells her that he updated her list of potential brides in order of preference. He says, ""I hope the sorting hat is not too disappointed."" They both agree that attempting to court his first choice would be the most efficient option. He asks her to keep the new list between them and that he will speak to Queen Helena after the coronation. Willow agrees. She opens the list when she is alone, and discovers that Robert has crossed out Kathryn's name and puts hers at the top.  A flashback to Robert's childhood shows him playing chess with his father. He is arrogant even in his youth and spends hours learning to beat his father after Simon walks away. This is why the hourglass shown at the beginning of the season is special to Robert. Fast forward a year ago and Simon praises Robert for learning all of the lessons he had taught him. Unfortunately, Simon believes that (unlike Liam) Robert will never be a good king as he lacks the virtues that cannot be learned, but ones that you are only born with. He reveals his plan to disband the monarchy as a result.  Robert never reveals this to anyone. Robert and the family (minus Cyrus and Liam) make their way onto the balcony. Robert and Willow share a knowing look. Robert is crowned King of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms.      Quotes Edit  “ Your hubris, Robert.

"Amber Tamblyn, 34, took to Twitter on September 11 to allege that now-70-year-old actor James Woods had ""tried to pick [up]"" her and a friend and that he invited her to Las Vegas when she was 16. According to People , Amber's tweets came in response to actor Armie Hammer tweeting to Woods, ""Didn't you date a 19 year old when you were 60.......?"" following Woods's criticism of Armie's upcoming film, in which he plays a 24-year-old dating a 17-year-old.  ""James Woods tried to pick me and my friend up at a restaurant once. He wanted to take us to Vegas. 'I'm 16' I said. 'Even better' he said,"" Amber tweeted.  Woods has since denounced Amber's tweet as a lie , to which Amber responded with a screenshot of a text in which she asked a friend if they remembered the time Woods allegedly tried to pick them up as teens.  ""Damn totally forgot about that,"" the friend replied.  Many on Twitter have responded to the allegations, some supporting Amber and making allegations of their own.  James, however, equated much of the response to his initial tweet about Armie Hammer's movie, Call Me by Your Name , to ""trolls,"" even adding that he likes Armie as an actor.  Teen Vogue received an open letter from Amber Tamblyn to James Woods, which is printed in full below. We've reached out to Woods's agent, but we haven't yet been able to connect.  Dear Mr. Woods,  What you are experiencing is called a teachable moment. It is called a gift. It is called a humbling. It is called Jesus, I come to thee. It is called an awakening. It is called a growth edge. It is called hope.  The hope being that through this experience, you can change. You can redefine the man who will come after this moment and this man who came before.  Since you've now called me a liar, I will now call you a silencer. I see your gaslight and now will raise you a scorched earth.  My friend Billy and I were at the Roxy on Sunset Boulevard seeing a band we loved. We decided to go to Mel's diner on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood to get burgers after. I had just gotten my driver's license and very specifically remember my nervousness trying to park in the diner parking lot. Upon leaving the restaurant we were stopped by you and your friend, who both seemed very nice. At one point you suggested we should all go to Las Vegas together. ""It's such a great place, have you ever been?"" You tried to make it sound innocent. This is something predatory men like to do, I've noticed. Make it sound innocent. Just a dollop of insinuation. Just a hair of persuasion. Just a pinch of suggestion. ""It will be so much fun, I promise you. Nothing has to happen, we will just have a good time together."" I told you my age, kindly and with no judgment or aggression. I told you my age because I thought you would be immediately horrified and take back your offer. You laughed and said, ""Even better. We'll have so much fun, I promise.""  Here's the thing, Mr. Woods. At that time I was not a public persona. I had done a couple years on a soap opera as an actress, but you wouldn't know me from Adam. I'm sure you've racked your brain trying to remember how you could've possibly hit on the actress Amber Tamblyn at a diner almost two decades ago. You think, it's not possible, there's no way I would've been so stupid as to hit on a 16-year-old known actress. But I wasn't known then, James. I was just a girl. And I'm going to wager that there have been many girls who were just girls or women who were just women who you've done this to because you can get away with it.  The saddest part of this story doesn't even concern me but concerns the universal woman's story. The nation's harmful narrative of disbelieving women first, above all else. Asking them to first corroborate or first give proof or first make sure we're not misremembering or first consider the consequences of speaking out or first let men give their side or first just let your sanity come last.  So it is with hope, Mr. Woods, that I ask you to go inward now and ask yourself the hard stuff. The ominous unconscious stuff. The archetypal masculinity stuff. The power-play stuff. The perversion persuasion stuff. The secretive stuff. The id's most cherished stuff.  Only you and your darkness know who you are. Only you and your actions know what you've done. That means you and only you have the power to change your behavior.  Are you and your history with women and girls a part of the problem, Mr. Woods?  Go now and look in the mirror and ask yourself if this is true. Go on, I'll wait. But I won't hold my breath.  Related: Amber Tamblyn Shares Sexual Assault Story After Donald Trump Comments",1
"Three more accusers have reportedly come forward accusing former House of Cards star Kevin Spacey of sexual assault.  London’s Metropolitan Police are investigating the actor after men separately reported him for separate attacks that respectively occurred Westminster in 1996, in Lambeth in 2008 and in Gloucester in 2013, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Met does not identify people who are subject to investigations until charges have been filed and would not confirm Spacey is being investigated. However, a spokesperson confirmed that officers from the Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating six separate, male-on-male alleged sexual assaults that match the three dates published by TMZ, as well as three dates previously connected to Spacey.  Kevin Spacey Frazer Harrison/BAFTA LA/Getty Images  Spacey’s attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  In October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had previously made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was just 14 years old.  In response, Spacey, now 58, issued a statement on Twitter addressing the allegations and coming out as gay.  “I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I’m beyond horrified to hear his story,” he said. “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”  Several more people accused the actor of sexual harassment or assault since, and in April, one sexual assault case against the star reported to have taken place in October of 1992 in West Hollywood involving a male adult was turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for further review.  In November, the actor entered a treatment facility. He has not been out in public since and has been written off the finale season of House of Cards.  On Tuesday, actor Guy Pearce hinted at an unpleasant experience while working with Spacey.  “Yeah… Tough one to talk about at the moment,” he said on Australian talk show host Andrew Denton’s Interview, according to Independent. “Amazing actor; incredible actor. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He’s a handsy guy.”",1
"Speaking in Cleveland, Ohio, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for unity in the wake of the tragic shooting in Orlando. Here are key moments from that speech. (Reuters/Associated Press)Hillary Clinton delivered an address pledging that as president she would take on ""lone wolves"" who might carry out terrorist attacks in the United States and calling for unity in light of the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday. The compete transcript of her remarks in Cleveland are posted below.SPEAKER: FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATECLINTON: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you. I am -- I'm absolutely -- I'm absolutely delighted to be back in Cleveland and to be here at the Industrial Innovation Center. I've had a chance to learn about the great work you do here. I especially want to applaud Team Wendy for everything you do to protect our troops, first responders.(APPLAUSE)And others from traumatic brain injury. It is so important that we continue to support those who protect us.AUDIENCE: We want Hillary!CLINTON: Thank you.AUDIENCE: We want Hillary!CLINTON: Thank you all.AUDIENCE: We want Hillary!(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is good to be back in Cleveland, I can tell you that.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank -- I wan to thank your extraordinary senator, Sherrod Brown, for his leadership, for that very kind and generous introduction. You are very fortunate to -- to have him representing you. I want to thank your congresswoman, Marcia Fudge...(APPLAUSE)Who is both indomitable and indefatigable. She is such a tenacious advocate for the people she represents. I want to acknowledge the mayor, Mayor Jackson, who was here, County Executive Budish (ph). And I particularly want to recognize the passing of George Voinovich, and he devoted his life to serving the people of Ohio as mayor of Cleveland, as governor and senator. And we send our prayers and sympathy to his family.I also want to thank Dan Moore, the owner and founder of this company and Team Wendy for his belief in Cleveland, for his commitment to create jobs. I can't wait to work with him to do more of what he has accomplished here.(APPLAUSE)You know, originally, I had intended to come to Cleveland under very different circumstances. We are heading into a general election that could be the most consequential of our lifetimes. But today is not a day for politics.On Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare that's become mind numbingly familiar. Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected. A madman filled with hate, with guns in his hands, and just a horrible sense of vengeance and vindictiveness in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americans, and by extension, the openness and diversity that defines our American way of life.We will learn more about the killer in the days to come. We know that he pledged allegiance to ISIS, that they are now taking credit and that part of their strategy is to radicalize individuals and encourage attacks against the United States, even if they are not coordinated with ISIS leadership. But there's a lot we still don't know, including what other mix of motives drove him to kill.The more we learn about what happened, the better we'll be able to protect our people going forward. In the days ahead, we will also learn more about the many lives he viciously cut short, many of them young people, just starting out in their lives. They were travel agents and pharmacy techs, college students and amusement park workers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and they had one thing in common. They all had a lot more to give.CLINTON: We should take a moment today amid our busy lives to think about them, to pray for everyone who was killed, for the wounded, those who are fighting to regain their lives and futures, for our first responders who walked into danger one more time. As a mother, I can't imagine what those families are going through.But let's also remember the other scenes we saw on Sunday. We saw the faces of some of those first responders who rushed into danger and tried to save as many people as they could. We saw survivors like Chris Hansen who risked their lives to help others.People gathering outside hospitals to comfort anxious family members, waiting for news of their loved ones and waiting, too, to learn more about what they could do to make sure this never happened again.Religion leaders condemning hate and appealing for peace. People lining up to donate blood. Americans refusing to be intimidated or divided.Yesterday I called Mayor Dyer of Orlando and offered my support and my appreciation for the leadership that he and the other officials have shown. This is a moment when all Americans need to stand together.No matter how many times we endure attacks like this, the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security and makes us furious.Now we have to steal our resolve to respond. And that's what I want to talk to you about. How we respond.The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values.(APPLAUSE)I have no doubt -- I have no doubt we can meet this challenge if we meet it together. Whatever we learn about this killer, his motives in the days ahead, we know already the barbarity that we face from radical jihadists is profound.In the Middle East, ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. They are slaughtering Muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways. They are beheading civilians, including executing LGBT people. They are murdering Americans and Europeans, enslaving, torturing and raping women and girls.In speeches like this one, after Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, I have laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and the other radical jihadist groups in the region and beyond.The attack in Orlando makes it even more clear, we cannot contain this threat. We must defeat it. And the good news is that the coalition effort in Syria and Iraq has made recent gains in the last months.So we should keep the pressure on ramping up the air campaign, accelerating support for our friends fighting to take and hold ground and pushing our partners in the region to do even more.We also need continued American leadership to help resolve the political conflicts that fuel ISIS recruitment efforts.But as ISIS loses actual ground in Iraq and Syria, it will seek to stage more attacks and gain stronger footholds wherever it can, from Afghanistan, to Libya, to Europe.The threat is metastasizing. We saw this in Paris. And we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.CLINTON: So, yes, efforts to defeat ISIS on the battlefield must succeed. But it will take more than that.(APPLAUSE)We have to be just as adaptable and versatile as our enemies. As president, I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority.(APPLAUSE)I will put a team together from across our government, the entire government, as well as the private sector and communities to get on top of this urgent challenge. And I will make sure our law enforcement and intelligence professionals have all the resources they need to get the job done.As we do this, there are three areas that demand attention. First, we and our allies must work hand-in-hand to dismantle the networks that move money, and propaganda, and arms and fighters around the world.(APPLAUSE)We have to flow -- we have to stem the flow of jihadists from Europe and Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and then back again. The only way to do this is by working closely with our partners, strengthening our alliances, not weakening them or walking away from them.Second, here at home, we must harden our own defenses. We have to do more to support our first responders, law enforcement and intelligence officers who do incredible work every day at great personal risk to keep our country safe.(APPLAUSE)I have seen firsthand how hard their job is, and how well they do it.In Orlando, at least one police officer was shot in the head. Thankfully, his life was saved by a Kevlar helmet, something folks here at Team Wendy know a lot about.(APPLAUSE)It has often been said that our law enforcement, our intelligence agencies, our first responders have to be right 100 percent of the time, but terrorists only have to be right once.What a heavy responsibility. These men and women deserve both our respect and gratitude. And they deserve the right tools, and resources and training. Too often, state and local officials can't get access to intelligence from the federal government that would help them do their jobs.We need to change that. We also need to work...(APPLAUSE)We also need to work with local law enforcement and business owners on ways to protect vulnerable, so-called soft targets, like nightclubs and shopping malls and hotels and movie theaters and schools and houses of worship.Now, I know a lot of Americans are asking how it was possible that someone already on the FBI's radar could have still been able to commit an attack like the one in Orlando, and what more we can do to stop this kind of thing from happening again.Well, we have to see what the investigation uncovers. If there are things that can and should be done to improve our ability to prevent, we must do them. We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out.That's why I have proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board with appropriate safeguards here at home.Even as we make sure our security officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attack.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino.(APPLAUSE)I believe weapons of war have no place on our streets and we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things.If the FBI is watching you for a suspected terrorist link, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.And you shouldn't be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show.And yes, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.Now, I know some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism. Well, in Orlando and San Bernardino terrorists used assault weapons, the AR-15. And they used it to kill Americans. That was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook.We have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war. And that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack, but it will stop some and it will save lives and it will protect our first responders.And I want you to know, I'm not going to stop fighting for these kinds of provisions.Now, the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by ISIS and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the United States and Europe.For starters, it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism.We also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online. This is something that I spend a lot of time on at the State Department.As president, I will work with our great tech companies from Silicon Valley to Boston to step up our game. We have to a better job intercepting ISIS' communications, tracking and analyzing social media posts and mapping jihadist networks, as well as promoting credible voices who can provide alternatives to radicalization.And there is more to do offline as well.CLINTON: Since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have worked hard to build relationships with Muslim American communities. Millions of peace-loving Muslims live, work and raise their families across America. And they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, and the best positioned to help us block it. So we should be intensifying contacts in those communities, not scapegoating or isolating them.(APPLAUSE)Last year, I visited a pilot program in Minneapolis that helps parents, teachers, imams, mental health professionals and others recognize signs of radicalization in young people and work with law enforcement to intervene before it's too late.I've also met with local leaders pursuing innovative approaches in Los Angeles and other places. And we need more efforts like that in more cities across America. And as the director of the FBI has pointed out, we should avoid eroding trust in that community, which will only make law enforcement's job more difficult.Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.(APPLAUSE)So does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow Americans because of their religion. It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. That's wrong. And it's also dangerous. It plays right into the terrorists' hands.Still, as I have said before, none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use their distorted version of Islam to justify slaughtering $ innocent people. They'd take us all back to the Stone Age if they could, just as they have in parts of Iraq and Syria.The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. And an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.(APPLAUSE) And I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country. You have millions of allies who will always have your back.(APPLAUSE)And I am one of them.(APPLAUSE)From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.Our open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability. It makes us stronger and more resistant to radicalization. And this raises a larger point about the future of our country.America is strongest when we all believe that we have a stake in our country and our future.CLINTON: This vision has sustained us from the beginning. The belief that, yes, we are all created equal and the journey we have made to turn that into reality over the course of our history, that we are not a land of winners and losers, that we should all have the opportunity to live up to our God-given potential. And we have a responsibility to help others do so as well.(APPLAUSE)As I look at American history, I see that this has always been a country of ""we"" not ""me."" We stand together because we are stronger together. E pluribus unum. One -- out of many, one -- has seen us through the darkest chapters of our history. Ever since 13 squabbling colonies put aside their disagreements and united because they realized they were going to rise together or fall separately, generation after generation has fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of dignity and opportunity. Ending slavery. Securing and expanding the right to vote. Throwing open the doors of education. Building the greatest middle class the world has ever seen.And we are stronger when more people can participate in our democracy.(APPLAUSE)And we are stronger when everyone can share in the rewards of our economy and contribute to our communities, when we bridge our divides and lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. Now we have overcome a lot together and we will overcome the threats of terror and radicalization and all of our other challenges. Here in Ohio and across America, I've listened to people talk about the problems that keep you up at night.The bonds that hold us together as communities, as one national community, are strained by an economy with too much inequality and too little upward mobility. By social and political divisions that have diminished our trust in each other and our confidence in our shared future. I have heard that, and I want you to know as your president I will work every day to break down all the barriers holding you back and keeping us apart. We're gonna get an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, we're gonna forge a new sense of connection and shared responsibility to each other and our nation.And finally,(APPLAUSE) finally let me remind us all, I remember, I remember how it felt, on the day after 9/11, and I bet many of you do as well. Americans from all walks of life rallied together with a sense of common purpose on September the 12th and in the days and weeks and months that followed. We had each others' backs. I was a senator from New York. There was a Republican president, a Republican governor, and a Republican mayor. We did not attack each other. We worked with each other to protect our country and to rebuild our city (ph).(APPLAUSE)President Bush went to a Muslim community center just six days after the attacks to send a message of unity and solidarity. To anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our Muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, ""That should not, and that will not, stand in America."" It is time to get back to the spirit of those days, spirit of 9/12. Let's make sure we keep looking to the best of our country, to the best within each of us. Democratic and Republican presidents have risen to the occasion in the face of tragedy. That is what we are called to do my friends and I am so confident and optimistic that is exactly what we will do.Thank you all so much.",1
"More than two months after Rob Kardashian‘s explosive social media rampage against Blac Chyna launched a custody war over their daughter, PEOPLE confirms the ex-fiancés have come to an agreement.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Kardashian, 30, and Chyna, 29, have agreed to joint custody of their 10-month-old daughter Dream Renée.  “Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully coparent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,” her attorney, Lisa Bloom, tells PEOPLE. “Because Rob agreed to continue to stay away from Chyna and not contact her, Chyna has agreed to take the domestic abuse hearing scheduled for Monday, Sept. 18, off calendar. She will always have the right to go back into court if further incidents of domestic abuse occur.”  Still, Bloom says “this agreement does not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.”  Kardashian and Chyna’s roller coaster relationship began in January 2016, when the two went public with their romance. The pairing initially raised eyebrows due to Chyna’s complicated history with the Kardashian-Jenner family: She shares a son with Kardashian’s sister Kylie Jenner‘s former boyfriend Tyga and is best friends with Amber Rose, an ex of Kanye West, who is now married to Kim Kardashian West.  Prince Williams/WireImage  The two feuded on social media throughout their relationship, but the tension reached its peak on July 5, when Kardashian repeatedly shared graphic and expletive-ridden content about his ex — including three naked photos — while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.  Chyna and her legal team accused him of violating California’s revenge porn laws, claiming in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that Kardashian allegedly hit her and threatened to kill himself multiple times. A judge later granted her a set of restraining orders against Kardashian.  FROM PEN: Blac Chyna Recalls the Shocking Moment Rob Kardashian Uploaded Her Most Intimate Photos Online  Earlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that Kardashian was “listening to advice from his family and instructions from his lawyer to behave.”  “Everyone wants him to be quiet and not get into any more trouble,” said the source, adding that Kardashian — who has long struggled with his weight and depression — “isn’t healthy, and isn’t making huge efforts to get healthier, but he does really care about Dream.”  “He loves spending time with her,” the source said. “He always misses Dream when she is with Chyna.”  In an exclusive sit-down with PEOPLE in July, Chyna insisted she’s committed to co-parenting her daughter with her ex.  “I feel that the key to successful co-parenting is communication and respect,” she said. “I might have one point of view, but hopefully Dream and King’s fathers add theirs, and we can come together to build better people. I know right and wrong. I’m pretty sure they know right and wrong. We’re going to do the best we can.”",1
"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too. Sometimes, people can’t walk back and forth in both worlds.”  Earlier this year, Erick Sermon recruited Mack alongside Method Man and Mr. Cheeks for “Come Thru,” the first single off Sermon’s upcoming album. “I’m devastated over the news of Craig Mack,” Sermon tweeted. “We just finishing up his new album.”  “It was a pleasure to know you & rock with you,” LL Cool J added. “You $tepped away from the game & did it your way.. I always respected that.”  “I am grateful to have worked with him,” Missy Elliott tweeted. “He was so kind, funny & talented.”  Toney, who helped produce Project: Funk Da World, told the NY Daily News he was working on a documentary about Mack. “Nobody got to understand his story,” Toney said. “I wanted the world to know the talent he had. It was something I wanted people to enjoy, but it was cut short because he was very religious and wanted to go to church.”  Craig Mack – “Flava in Ya Ear”    Craig Mack – “Jockin My Style”",1

"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!

Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again.",0
"Caitlyn Jenner is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot, DailyMail.com can disclose.  Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1995 trial.  The disgraced football star was acquitted of the charges but, in 1998, was found ‘responsible’ for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial.  Writing in her memoir, Jenner says she was in a car with Kardashian a few years after the murders when he said: 'I would’ve been okay with it if they had gotten him [Simpson] in the first trial.'  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody  She added: 'The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.’  According to a family insider, Kris and the four Kardashians now rarely speak to Jenner.  The insider said: ‘Kylie and do [talk to Jenner]. They do keep in communication and they’re fully supportive [of her transition].  ‘But when Kylie and Kendall do speak with her, it’s always secret – they don’t want to bring it up to their mom or sisters because it causes a lot of drama, so they keep it secret and between them.’  The source added: ‘It’s just the Kardashian part of the family that hasn’t been talking to her. They feel like she had been riding on their coattails long enough for the fame and that she is really milking it for all its worth.  ‘They feel if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own - a lot of these things that she’s doing are trying to one-up them and trying to gain the spotlight back.  ‘While [the operation] was inevitable, they think her plan to do the nude spread is over the top. That’s something that is really annoying to them.’",0
"Nicki Minaj had an awkward camel toe moment at the BET Awards on June 24 during her performance, however, Drake is here for it! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why he loves the wardrobe malfunction and her style in general!  Drake is Nicki Minaj’s biggest fan! If you keep up with either rapper, you know they have quite a history. From their feud in the past, their rumored romance, Drake’s beef with Nicki’s ex-boyfriend Meek Mill, to their many collaborations including “No Frauds,” it’s clear these two are always going to be in each other’s lives. So, it’s no surprise that when everyone trolled Nicki for her unfortunate wardrobe malfunction at the BET Awards on June 24, Drake would come to her defense. “Drake thinks Nicki’s style and her camel toe are sexy AF. He thinks she is beautiful, talented, and confident enough to rock an outfit even if it highlights her camel toe,” a source close to Drake tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.  For those of you who need a refresher, it all happened when Nicki took the stage at the Staples Center to perform “Chun-Li” and “Rich Sex”. However, her red latex body suit was hugging her in all the WRONG places. She even placed her hand over her private area in hopes of hiding it. But, fans were quick to point it out. “When he saw her BET outfit he was majorly turned on. He thought she looked great,” our insider added.  “Drake thinks Nicki is the only rapper that always looks sexy no matter what she wears. He would still hook-up with Nicki anytime,” the source continued. Talk about determination! “Drake has always felt Nicki was wifey material and her style choices are always sexy,” the source said.

The pair announced their son’s arrival in the London Times: “On 10th March 2018 to Hannah (Bagshawe) and Edward, a son, Luke Richard Bagshawe Redmayne, brother to Iris.”  The couple revealed in November 2017 that they were expecting baby No. 2. “Eddie and Hannah are delighted to confirm they are expecting a second child,” a spokesperson for the Oscar winner, 36, told Us Weekly at the time.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle is reportedly 'frustrated' by the strict royal protocols that govern her new life since marrying Prince Harry .  Members of the public watching Meghan's transformation from Hollywood actress into the Duchess of Sussex could be forgiven for thinking she'd taken to her new role with ease.  She made an effortless joint engagement with the Queen to open a new bridge, attended the RAF centenary flypast, was a guest of the Irish President alongside Harry, joined sister-in-law Kate Middleton at Wimbledon and looked stunning at Prince Louis' christening.  But she is reportedly confused about aspects of royal life and the old-fashioned ways of the Windsor household.  A source told People.com how Meghan ""has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way"".  (Image: Getty)  (Image: PA)  The source added: ""I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it.”  The monarchy website includes a reference to Meghan as a ""feminist"".  She had never previously shied away from voicing her opinions on issues that were close to her heart.  But protocol prohibits royal family members from expressing political opinions.  There was no greater example of this than an Irish politician's recent blunder which revealed Meghan's opinions on the country's recent referendum on legalising abortion .  (Image: WPA Pool)  Senator Catherine Noone posted on Facebook : ""A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador's Residence this evening.  ""The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.""  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon.  Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting.  But from an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active.  Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert's sexist language changed.  She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if ""misogynistic"" Donald Trump was elected US president.",0

"There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together.",0
"Kylie Jenner was spotted out and about with two giant, sparkly diamond rings on her ring finger and everyone's all, ""ooooooh she's engaged to Travis Scott!"" BUT IS SHE??  First, let's look at the evidence — which is just this picture that the paps snapped while Kylie was out and about with bestie Jordyn Woods on Saturday afternoon.  BACKGRID  Kylie also shared some video of the rings:  And uh... that's all the evidence we have.  Back in early March, Kylie sparked rumors that she was engaged when she wore a band on her ring finger, but that turned out just to be a ring. OR WAS IT?!  What's more, Kylie appears to have worn these exact diamond rings before!?  So what's the deal — has she been engaged for months, or is she just messing with us? Or does she just like RINGS? Which is possible, rings are dope.  Rumors have been around that the couple would get married ever since people started speculating that Kylie was pregnant, but sources close to the couple told People that they weren't planning on marry any time soon.  On Valentine's Day, another family friend shared the same thoughts. “Despite being new parents, Kylie and Travis are still in a new relationship too. Kylie is happy with their living situation,” the source said. “Travis is a great dad. When he wants to work, Kylie is supportive.”  So there you have it! They're not engaged! Unless they maybe are! Only time (and also, an Instagram post from both of them) will tell!",1
"Prince Harry's net worth is 8-figures. Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Megan Markle will be marrying into class, status, and major wealth when she ties the royal knot with Prince Harry on May 19.  Before she moved across the pond, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama ""Suits,"" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Her total net worth is estimated to be $5 million.  That's a sizable contribution to bring into any marriage, but when she marries Prince Harry, their combined net worth will be more than five times that. Prince Harry's net worth is at least $25 million (£18 million) and as much as $40 million (£28.7 million), according to estimates from Wealth-X.  Here's where all that money comes from.  Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million (£3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.  Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family's public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million (£20.7 million), including Harry and William's allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.  Chris Jackson/Getty  Since age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana's estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government. They received a sizeable inheritance from their late mother estimated to be around $10 million each, which each prince gained access to on his 30th birthday. Plus, during his 10 years in the British Royal Air Force, Harry earned an annual income of $50,000.  Despite a massive fortune, Markle and Harry reportedly will not sign a prenuptial agreement before their wedding, reported Business Insider's Shana Lebowtiz.  A prenup is a smart choice for most couples who have sizable assets they want to protect in the event of a divorce, but for Harry — and William, who chose to forgo a prenup with Middleton — it doesn't make much sense. The princes likely don't have much property of their own, as the most valuable national treasures like the Crown Jewels or the Tower of London are part of the royal collection held by the Queen.  Still, the merging of Harry and Markle's finances could ""cause tax headaches"" and create some ""mundane hurdles"" for the royal family, as The Washington Post first reported in November.  Markle is a citizen of the US and is purportedly living in the UK on a family visa, according to the BBC. If she eventually becomes a dual US-UK citizen, Markle will have to continue filing her taxes each year with the IRS. If she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the year, she will have to file a specific form that details foreign assets, which could include foreign trusts, subjecting the royal family ""to outside scrutiny,"" according to the Post. But ultimately there are a lot of factors that come into play.  Eddie Mulholland/AP  ""The key for Meghan and her advisors would be to figure out what type of income she will be getting,"" Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, told Business Insider. ""Will this income be from the investments of a trust, or 'wages' for any work that she does, or any other type of income? Sometimes, getting one form of income is more advantageous than another.""  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding — aside from Markle's dress — which is expected to cost the royal family upwards of $45 million (£32 million), most of which is allotted for security.  That won't be a huge cost burden for Queen Elizabeth, who is of course the wealthiest member of the royal family with an estimated net worth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.

"Did Tyga just drop a Kylie Jenner diss track?

Us Weekly exclusively reported in April that the hip-hop star moved out of the reality star’s $6 million mansion in Hidden Hills, California. “Tyga does really make Kylie happy, and when they break up it makes Kylie super sad,” a source told Us at the time. “He’s her first big love and they still speak every day.”  Just weeks after Tyga packed his bags, Jenner moved on to rapper Travis Scott. “Travis is telling friends that he and Kylie are the real deal,” an insider told Us last month.

"Antonia passed away in March of last year due to a fatal battle with pneumonia.  On the upcoming third season, Teresa visits the Hollywood Medium where he revealed to E! News that it was one of the hardest readings he has done yet.  ""That was really probably one of the toughest ones of the entire season because Teresa's reading, her grief was still very tangible. It was really clear in her face,” he told E! News exclusively.  ""She was still very much grieving her mother. And I think the reading came at an important time. I think it was necessary for her to have that experience. I think it's one of those ones where it will take time for her to really process the magnitude. Not only the experience but also of her grief. It was just a really vulnerable, emotional side of Teresa that I think people will see and be able to relate to. And I really appreciate that she put her grief so openly out there to the world because people will relate to it and also be able to heal from it who are in similar situations, just through that reliability. So that was really special.”  The good thing about the reading was that it brought Teresa some much needed closure, according to Tyler. ""I think obviously the inherent nature of this is comforting in knowing that our loved ones are around. I think for her it was also just about talking through the physical loss and I think she was still very much focused on that physical loss, and that's a very normal state to be in especially when a passing is so recent.”  He also added that Antonia made no mention of Teresa’s past legal troubles nor her husband Joe's future behind bars.  ""When she came through, her mother was really very much just focused on the present moment,"" he said. ""And obviously her death came at a very difficult time when the family was going through a lot and anticipating a lot so I think she was just very much focused on kind of picking up those pieces and regrouping. There were messages that focused towards the future obviously for Teresa. I don't know what will be shown, what won't, but it was all very positive. There was nothing that came through that was any way negative and it was just very much focused on telling her what to focus on and what's worth your energy, what's not. Just help to provide that clarity for her so that was good.”",1

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Scott Stump  In an interview with Stephen Colbert on ""The Late Show,"" James Franco responded to sexual misconduct allegations raised against him on social media during Sunday's Golden Globes.  Franco was criticized on Twitter for wearing a Time's Up pin at the awards show in support of the movement to fight sexual harassment by a handful of women who claimed he'd behaved inappropriately in the past.  ""Things that I heard were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn't have a voice for so long,'' Franco told Colbert on Tuesday. ""I don't want to shut them down in any way. I think it's a good thing and I support it.""  Colbert asked Franco if it's possible for there to be reconciliation between his thoughts about what happened and the accusations leveled against him.  ""If there's restitution to be made, I will make it,'' Franco said after a long pause. ""If I've done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.""  On a night when he won a best actor award for his role in ""The Disaster Artist,"" the 39-year-old was called out on Twitter by actresses Violet Paley and Sarah Tither-Kaplan for what they described as sexually inappropriate and exploitative behavior.  Ally Sheedy, the ""Breakfast Club"" star who acted in a 2014 Off-Broadway play directed by Franco, also made cryptic references to Franco on Twitter during the Golden Globes.  ""James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business,"" she wrote in a tweet that has since been deleted.  In another tweet, the actress wrote, ""Why is James Franco allowed in?""  Franco told Colbert, ""I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy.""  ""I had nothing but a great time with her. I have total respect for her,"" he added. ""I have no idea why she was upset. She took the tweet down. I can’t speak for her.""  Franco also reasserted his reason for wearing the pin representing the Time's Up movement in which more than 300 actresses initially donated more than $13 million to a legal defense fund that supports men and women who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.  ""I wore (the pin) because I do support it,'' Franco said. ""I support change.""  Follow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.",1

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.  FILE PHOTO: Show host Ryan Seacrest addresses the audience during the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  Within the United States, the “American Idol” phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” CBS’s “Rock Star”, and Fox’s “The X Factor.”  Pop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.  “I’m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!” wrote Perry. “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”",1
"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we’re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  “Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”  And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  “It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE’S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  “Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

"CLOSE Bill O’Reilly is mad at a lot of people, including God. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) reports. Buzz60  Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. (Photo: Andy Kropa, AP)  Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly is angrily denying a report that he paid one woman $32 million to settle sexual harassment allegations, blaming a conspiracy to drive him from ""the marketplace"" and even raging against the Almighty.  ""You know, am I mad at God? Yeah, I'm mad at him,"" O'Reilly said Monday in a post on his website. ""I wish I had more protection. I wish this stuff didn't happen. I can't explain it to you. If I die tomorrow and I get an opportunity, I'll say 'why'd you guys work me over like that? Didn't know my children were going to be punished? And they're innocent.'""  The New York Times reported Saturday that O'Reilly paid $32 million to Lis Wiehl, a Fox News legal analyst who made regular appearances on O'Reilly's show for 15 years, in a settlement related to sexual harassment allegations. Wiehl accused O'Reilly of ""repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to her,"" the Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.  On his website, O'Reilly denounced the report as a ""smear piece"" and said ""these people at the New York Times are out to hurt people with whom they disagree. They don't want me in the marketplace. That's what this is all about.""  More: Bill O'Reilly dismisses NYT report as 'lies and smears'  More: Megyn Kelly complained to Fox execs about Bill O'Reilly's sexual harassment stand  In April, the Times reported on five other settlements involving O'Reilly and women accusing him of sexual harassment. The revelation led to Fox News' decision to part ways with its star commentator.  On Monday, O'Reilly said that in more than 20 years he only ""resolved three situations"" and that he did it ""to protect my children from harm.""  O'Reilly has repeatedly said the potential impact on his children is a major reason for his outrage over the Times report.  ""The pain it brings to my children is indescribable,"" O'Reilly told the Times when it interviewed him about the reported $32 million settlement. ""I would give up my life to protect my children, but I find myself unable to protect them because of things that are being said about me, their father.""  ""This is horrible what I went through, horrible what my family went through,"" he continued. O'Reilly said the report was ""politically and financially motivated"" and that he could ""prove it with shocking information but I'm not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press.""  O'Reilly invoked the memory of his former Fox News colleague Eric Bolling's son, 19-year-old Eric Chase Bolling, who was found dead in an apartment while away at college. Fox News had just parted ways with Bolling amid sexual harassment allegations when his son died and O'Reilly seemed to say that was behind the teen's death.  ""I urge you to think about what you put in your newspaper,"" O'Reilly told the Times reporters. ""Eric Bolling's son is dead. Is dead, because of allegations made, in my opinion — and I know this to be true — against Mr. Bolling.""  Separately, Bolling said in a statement that O'Reilly's comment was ""beyond inappropriate"" and that his ""parting from Fox News was in no way connected to the tragic news of my son's passing.""  O'Reilly apologized to Bolling in a tweet. ""The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more,"" O'Reilly tweeted.  Apologies to Eric Bolling and prayers for him and his family. The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more. — Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017  ""Thank Bill, apology accepted,"" Bolling tweeted back.  O'Reilly, on his website, said the Times doesn't care about children and is willing to run a story based on anonymous sources even though ""families are devastated.""  ""So and so said, so and so told me,"" O'Reilly said of the use of unnamed sources. ""That's what they do to Trump every day and that's why Trump is furious. That's why the President of the United States calls out The New York Times by name. But the culture war is that intense.""  ""Bottom line on this is that my enemies who want to silence me have made my life extremely difficult,"" he said.

"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can’t believe I’m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I’m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn’t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder.",0

"Reality personality Jon Gosselin continues to spend time with his daughter Hannah.  The father of eight posted a festive Instagram of the two on Wednesday, writing “Happy 4th of July!!! 🇺🇸”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Jon, 41, and Kate Gosselin, 43, finalized their divorce in 2009. Since the former Jon & Kate Plus 8 stars’ separation, Jon has been focused on his DJing career and battled his ex-wife for custody of the sextuplets and 17-year-old twins Mady and Cara.  Though he wished them a happy birthday via Instagram in October, Jon remains estranged from the twins. In August 2016, Mady and Cara told PEOPLE that they weren’t speaking to their father, who had given interviews to some media outlets about their strained relationship.  “He makes it seem like we’re being kept from him, which is insane,” Mady said. “He should maybe spend some time thinking about why we don’t want to see him, and maybe realize that if he ever does want a relationship with us, talking about us on TV is not the way to make that happen.”  Larsen & Talbert  “He doesn’t even know us,” she added. “How can he dare to talk about us?”  But Jon has been spending plenty of time with Hannah, including at a Father’s Day weekend dinner with his girlfriend Colleen at Buddakan in Atlantic City, New Jersey, last month. In May, Jon and Hannah celebrated her 14th birthday together and paid a visit to her brother Collin, who is currently enrolled in a program away from home for children with special needs.  Jon & Kate Plus 8 aired from 2007 to 2009 before being rebranded as Kate Plus 8 following the couple’s divorce. Kate will return to television this fall with a TLC dating series, Kate Plus Date.",1

"Michelle Obama and Barack Obama might be two of the most-missed former residents of the White House. Even though Obama's presidency ended over a year-and-a-half ago, the couple known for being #relationshipgoals has recently come back into the spotlight. With Obama's 57th birthday on Saturday, Aug. 4, Michelle took to social media to wish her husband a happy birthday with a sweet post about him. Michelle Obama wished Barack Obama happy birthday with a thoughtful photo and message to Obama on Instagram.  Like any good significant other in the age of technology, Michelle made sure that she wished Obama a happy birthday on social media. The photo of Obama on Instagram and Twitter is accompanied by a short caption, but Michelle did anything but phone it in on this one. She posted what looks like a personal picture of Obama looking deep in thought as he overlooks a desert, and she wrote,  Happy birthday @BarackObama! The view is always better with you.  OK, you can now add ""expert at writing captions"" to Michelle's resume. I mean, c'mon, that post is sure to bring a smile to Obama's face when he sees it. Would you really expect anything less from this couple, though?  These two have proven time and again that they know how to keep their relationship going strong. Just look at their date night on the weekend of July 28, when the couple attended Beyoncé and JAY-Z's OTR II tour in Maryland. Not only did they make time to spend together at the show, but they spent that time doing what you should be doing at a Beyoncé concert: dancing! Seriously, the Obamas showed that they know how to move to the music, and the lucky concertgoers around them caught it all on video — but beware to get all the FOMO when you watch it.  When it comes to birthdays, though, it really isn't shocking that Michelle knocked it out of the park with this post. Her short and sweet caption about how ""the view is always better"" with Obama is such a thoughtful message to her husband. The swoon-worthy birthday posts must be a hallmark of their relationship, because Obama also shared an IG post to his better half on Jan. 17 to celebrate Michelle's big day. He wrote,  You're not only my wife and the mother of my children, you're my best friend. I love your strength, your grace, and your determination. And I love you more each day. Happy Birthday, @MichelleObama  It's not only birthdays that bring out the sweet messages from this couple, though. Obama also wrote Michelle a Valentine's Day post on Feb. 14 that said she makes ""every day and every place better."" I'm inclined to agree with the former POTUS on that one.  Really, there is no shortage of examples of how these two celebrate and lift each other up on the most special days in their lives. I would like to imagine that they are also they kind of couple that leaves little love notes for each other around the house on a daily basis.  Of course, I don't know if that's how the Obamas roll, but I do know they've perfected the art of the social media birthday post. Hopefully Obama is brainstorming Michelle's post for January!",1
"If you think you've seen it all, think again. The Shahs of Sunset clique will return this July to Bravo, and they are bringing along plenty of ups and downs to keep you on the edge of your seat. Asa Soltan Rahmati, Golnesa “GG” Gharachedaghi, Mercedes “MJ” Javid, Mike Shouhed, Reza Farahan, and Shervin Roohparvar are back for more. And, believe us, there's nothing this tight- knit group of friends are holding back from one another in Season 6.  We'll follow the squad as they face a lot of new changes in their lives. Asa will embark on her journey to motherhood. Mike is facing life after his split from Jessica Parido, though she still always seems to be at top of mind. MJ is prepping to spend her life with Tommy while also having to deal with the challenges of watching her father's health take a turn.  Reza and Adam are taking life day by day during their first year of marriage as they continue to work out their own plans to start a family. Could it be that Shervin is finally ready to make things permanent with his long-distance girlfriend Annalise? Well their plans may get sidelined by rumors. And GG is taking back her life and her struggles with rheumatoid arthritis thanks to romance and a gig in a play in NYC.  The group will also head to Israel for what will probably be a life-changing experience. But, we'll let Reza sum up what is sure to be one crazy new season: ""I can't believe its been six years and I look this good.""  Shahs of Sunset returns Sunday, July 16 at 8/7c.

"The cover of Us Weekly this week features a Photoshopped composite of our pals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, with an American flag floating just above Meghan’s head. “COMING TO AMERICA!” the cover line shouts (with the similarly all-caps question touted beneath: “BUT IS HER DAD ON THE LIST?”).  Yes, the magazine claims that, per a Palace insider, Harry and Meghan are in the midst of planning a U.S. tour in the spring of 2019 (their first full-scale overseas tour as a married couple is set for this October, when they will travel to Australia and New Zealand timed for the Invictus Games). “They are so excited to head to the U.S.” the insider told the magazine. “Meghan is looking forward to introducing Harry to everything she loves about the U.S.” (Feel free to begin searching through the entries from the Tig you printed and arranged in a scrapbook to start deducing to which eateries and boutiques Meghan might introduce her husband.)  Us Weekly has additional posited details it is offering up, as well, claiming that the duo are “thinking New York, Washington, D.C., and California,” though they are “working to finalize locations and venues.” In California, they will reportedly visit San Francisco, where “they will meet with C.E.O.s and female tech entrepreneurs to encourage their involvement in the industry.” (Perhaps Meghan can pitch some Silicon Valley types on a Tig-esque recommendations app; or Harry can offer some suggestions on . . . maybe a polo V.R. experience?) “Meghan and Harry want to solidify ties between the U.K. and the U.S.,” the source says. “They want to highlight and foster these relationships.” There might be a Chicago component, as well, involving a stop at the Obama Foundation. While this is starting to sound like a quite sprawling tour already, there is also apparently talk of extending it to Canada, where Meghan lived (in Toronto) while she was filming Suits, for seven seasons.  The royal-related rumors—particularly Meghan-related ones—come fast and furious these days, so it’s hard to know exactly how seriously to take this report. A trip that involves stops in New York City, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, and Canada, seems somewhat insane; on the other hand, they will surely visit the U.S. at some point soon, especially since Meghan is from here. (The publication notes that Meghan will be making an “unofficial” solo trip to New York and Los Angeles later this summer “to see family and friends.” We can only imagine what sort of comments Thomas Markle will be making if that trip does not involve a stop to see him.)  Vanity Fair has reached out to the Palace for comment on the report.",0

"Look inside most women’s beauty cupboards and you’ll find a stash of old, unused potions and lotions.  But not so Catherine Zeta-Jones. The actress, 47, has given fans a peek inside her meticulously-tidy bathroom cabinet, in an image posted on her Instagram account.  ‘My face and beauty essentials,’ she wrote. ‘And no, I don’t use them all at the same time.’  The neat rows of products, many in duplicate or triplicate, mirror the recent glimpse she gave followers of her obsessively-organised walk-in wardrobe, which contains clothes worth more than half a million dollars.  Catherine Zeta-Jones has given fans a peek inside her meticulously-tidy bathroom cabinet, in an image posted on her Instagram account  The bathroom cabinet contains products worth more than $2,600, including cleanser made of Icelandic kelp and a $450 tub of face cream. Here we reveal the secrets lurking inside Catherine’s beauty cupboard:  1 Natura Bisse Diamond Extreme moisturizer, $355  This face cream contains extracts of artemia salina – a species of saltwater shrimp said to restore elasticity to the skin.  2 Natura Bisse The Cure Sheer eye cream, $125  Said to firm the delicate skin around the eyes and ‘erase any sign of tiredness’. Despite the hefty price, the bottle contains only 15ml.  3 Natura Bisse The Cure Sheer face cream, $190  Blurs dark circles and softens fine lines around the eyes, countering the effects of pollution. Contains a skin-plumping compound, fermentus glaciarum. Fans include Beyonce and Elle Macpherson.  4 Cygalle Healing Spa aromatherapy facial mist, $25  Infused with jojoba oil, this spray was sold as part of a Valentine’s Day set so may have been a gift from husband Michael Douglas, 72.  5 Rhonda Allison Cucumber Spritz, $26  Described as ‘giving skin a drink of water’, it is made from cucumber, coconut oil, witch hazel and honey. However, the spritz works best if kept in the fridge. Other Rhonda Allison fans include Sarah Jessica Parker and Mila Kunis.  6 Rhonda Allison Moisture Eye-Zyme, $16  Tones and firms the upper and lower lids while minimising fine lines and erasing crepey tissue. It uses the acid produced when the exotic fruit ferments.

"Actress Janina Gavankar reveals the cutest detail of Prince Harry and Meghan's exclusive wedding reception By Clare Douglas  Details about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle'sexclusive nighttime reception following their royal wedding have been the couple's best-kept secret… until now. The bride’s close friend Janina Gavankar was one of 200 guests to score an invite to the bash and has since revealed some of her favourite highlights from the evening.

We partied and celebrated and ate sliders at 2 in the morning,” shared the actress, adding that the party inside Frogmore House was the perfect ending to a “powerful day in history.""  Speaking to Town and Country, the former True Blood star let slip a few secrets, including the adorable nod the couple paid to their homelands.

Another moment the 37-year-old will not soon forget is the touching speech Prince Harry delivered to his new wife. “The speech was so funny, self deprecating, filled with love, and that guy just has her back.

"Ok, ladies, now let’s get on a vegan diet.  Beyoncé has resumed a plant-based diet in preparation for her Coachella appearance this year. The singer, who will take the stage of the music festival in California after backing out last year after the news of her pregnancy with twins, shared her diet with a delicious post on social media.  “44 days until Coachella! Vegan time!,” Beyoncé captioned an image of a not-so-simple avocado toast—as fancy an stylized as any other of the photos shared on the singer’s lavish Instagram.  This is not the first time that Bey adopts this nutritious lifestyle. In 2013, Queen B and her husband Jay-Z undertook a strict vegan regime, which, according to their personal trainer Marco Borges, the powerful couple came to love. “They walked away with a greater understanding of the powerful benefits of plant-based nutrition,” he said.  It seems that Beyoncé is resorting to all the high powers, including the alimentary ones, ahead of her highly anticipated appearance in Coachella!  Of course, diet is only one part of her prep work before heading to the desert of Indio, California. On Friday afternoon, the Single Ladies singer also shared a sneak peek at her rehearsals with her 12 million followers on Instagram.  And if her performance at Coachella is anywhere as good as these photos, we can expect 2018 to be the best edition the festival has ever seen! Who run Coachella? Beyoncé!",1

"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Former “The Bachelor” star Chris Soules “acted reasonably” after he rear-ended a fellow Iowa farmer by calling 911 and trying to resuscitate the man, his new legal team said Thursday.  Soules is charged with leaving the scene of a deadly accident, a felony that carries up to five years in prison, in Monday night’s crash near his farm in northern Iowa that killed 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher.  Authorities say that Soules’ truck rear-ended Mosher’s tractor, throwing him into a ditch. Police audio shows that Soules called 911 to report that he had “rear-ended a guy on a tractor” and sought medical help for Mosher before he left the scene in another vehicle.  Authorities say that Soules was located at his home about 10 miles away but that he initially refused to answer his door for officers. He was arrested five hours after the crash after they obtained a warrant to enter the home. Soules was released on bond Tuesday after 10 hours in jail.  Investigators are looking into who drove Soules away and whether alcohol, speed or texting played a role in the crash. The sheriff says alcoholic beverages were found at the scene and police are trying to determine who had possessed them.  Soules had been represented by attorney Molly Spellman at his initial court appearance Tuesday. But on Thursday, high-profile Iowa defense lawyer Alfredo Parrish and two colleagues from his Des Moines law firm informed the court that they are now representing Soules in the case.  A statement issued Thursday from the firm and Soules’ publicist argued audio of the 911 call showed that initial portrayals of Soules having fled the scene were misleading.  The statement noted that Soules identified himself on the call and “explained his role in the terrible accident.” It added that he tried to perform CPR on the victim and stayed until emergency medical personnel arrived — two facts that aren’t clear on the call.  The call featured someone performing CPR but it wasn’t clear that it was Soules, who told the dispatcher that he didn’t know the technique. The call was abruptly ended by Soules, who police say then “took off” in a truck.  “His attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher,” the statement said, adding that everyone “in this close-knit farming community is mourning Mr. Mosher’s passing.”  Soules, who is required to wear an ankle bracelet for monitoring, is due in court next week for a preliminary hearing.",1

"She usually keeps mum about her private life, but Nelly Furtado revealed in a new interview on Wednesday that she’s back on the market.  “I am single now,” she said on ITV’s Loose Women about secretly splitting from Demacio Castellon last summer. “Someone here needs to update my Wikipedia. It’s not helping my dating life!”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The singer, 38, wed the sound engineer in 2008 in an ultra-private ceremony that they kept hidden from the public until more than a year later.  “I went through an emotionally difficult time last summer and I actually wrote and sung myself songs to get through it,” Furtado, who’s currently promoting her sixth studio album, The Ride, said about the breakup. “I would sing to myself while I drove on these long drives, and I thought to myself, ‘I’m so lucky that I can write songs because I can soothe myself with them.'”  And though she’s still working through her heartbreak, the star says she’s focusing on her 13-year-old daughter, Nevis (with ex Jasper Gahunia).  “Sometimes you just want to sit home and bake some muffins for your daughter. I need to stay mentally and emotionally and physically well for my daughter,” she said.  In 2014, Furtado opened up about collaborating with Castellon on both her 2006 album, Loose, and her Spanish-language album, Mi Plan, which went platinum and won a Latin Grammy for best female pop vocal.  “It’s a healthy tension working together,” she told PEOPLE. “It doesn’t always go smoothly, of course, and it can be really challenging when there are differences of opinion, which of course happens.”  “We’re very blessed to have a beautiful family. We have a great life together. Life is good,” she added.",1

"Shania Twain has changed her live shows to avoid risking a Lyme disease flare-up.  The Still the One singer hits the road as part of her Now Tour next month (May18) to support her new album, but after being diagnosed with the infectious disease, which can cause nerve damage and paralysis, she can no longer perform without a strict set of guidelines.  “It’s more work for me now vocally because of the Lyme disease effect on the nerves in my larynges, so it’s like an hour and a half of, like, physical exercise,” she explained to E! News. “I take a mini trampoline with me and I’ve got to do a real pre-show show.”  The 52-year-old country icon insists her new concert series is “still sexy” despite the change in her routine behind-the-scenes, revealing she and her crew have crafted shows with “something nobody has seen before.”  Shania is grateful she caught the condition early, because it could have been much worse.  “Lyme disease does affect your life for sure. It’s such a silent, evil thing,” she shared. “A lot of the symptoms you just learn to live with. I was lucky that I caught it early. I did get a lot of damage but I’m not battling with degenerative organ issues, so I feel very fortunate.”  Shania went public with her Lyme disease diagnosis last summer (Jul17) and she is now looking at the illness as a source of empowerment and confidence.  “By the time you’re my age, you have something. Everybody’s got something in some form of their life,” she smiled. “I’m proud of myself on one hand for persevering.”  Shania’s Now Tour kicks off in Tacoma, Washington on 3 May (18).",1
"When you collect together Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Mark Mothersbaugh, and director Taika Waititi, there’s no way you can make a bad movie. And judging by a new behind the scenes video released by Marvel, Thor: Ragnarok looks every bit as good as we expected.  “Ragnarok is a new cycle; new realms, new universe,” explains Waititi. “It’s the destruction of the old and the rebirth of the new, and that’s really exciting to me. The way that I’ve approached this is to rebuild it in a new way.”  As we’ve seen from the posters and trailers, the tone of Thor: Ragnarok is completely different from the first two Thor movies, which were dark and brooding. It was a conscious choice by the cast and crew, one that mixes action and humor—sort of using the Guardians of the Galaxy approach.  If you’ve ever seen Waititi’s other work—I highly recommend Hunt for the Wilderpeople—the director seems like the perfect person to usher in this new version of Thor. If you want a taste of Waititi’s brand of humor, look no further than the “Team Thor” shorts he made about what Thor was up to during the events of Captain America: Civil War.  “What are the odds we survive this trip,” Thor asks Bruce Banner.  “I’d say the odds are a million to fun,” Banner retorts.  Thor: Ragnarok hits theaters on November 3.",1
"Since everyone's suddenly talking about Oprah 2020, let's talk about what her campaign might look like — or more specifically, what her opponents might do to it.  There's no reason to think politics will become any less brutal in the next two years. And there's every reason to expect that opposition researchers would happily dig through Oprah Winfrey's storied history as a talk-show host, cultural icon, fake book promoter, advocate of mystical healing powers, fearer of hamburgers and apparent chum of Harvey Weinstein.  Not to mention the child sex abuse scandal.  [Oprah for president in 2020? Here’s everything you need to know.]  Here's a sampling of the awkward and potentially problematic issues that Winfrey might have to explain on the campaign trail.  Oprah and the child sex abuse scandal  Remember the headache the defunct Trump University became for its namesake during his campaign? Some might prefer to forget the cascading disasters of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.  Winfrey called the sprawling, $40-million complex her “gift” to poor South African girls when it opened in 2007 — complete with a yoga studio and beauty salon. She initially had to defend the luxurious complex against accusations that it looked elitist in a country wracked by poverty.  She defended the school in her typical heartwarming style: “If you are surrounded by beautiful things and wonderful teachers who inspire you, that beauty brings out the beauty in you,” Winfrey told reporters before the grand opening.  The girls had “never been told they are pretty or have wonderful dimples,” she said. “I wanted to hear those things as a child.”  Several months later, a dorm matron was arrested and accused of sexually abusing at least half- a-dozen seventh- and eighth-graders.  Oprah was reportedly heartbroken. She cried for half an hour, she told reporters in a news conference after the matron's arrest. She accused school officials of covering up the scandal. They told the girls to “put on happy faces,” Winfrey said.  She dismissed the head mistress and promised to clean house at the academy.  But less than two years later, with the dorm matron's trial still pending, several girls were suspended or expelled after accusations that they tried to force other students into sexual and romantic relationships.  And then the original accusations began to unravel.  The next year, the Guardian reported, Oprah settled with the headmistress, who had accused her of defamation by suggesting that she knew of the dorm matron's actions.  A few months after that, the dorm matron was acquitted of all charges, the Guardian wrote. A judge had found the girls' accusations self-contradictory and not credible.  The matron told reporters that her life had been ruined. She was broke, unemployed and said she didn't know if she could ever forgive Winfrey, who continued to stand by the girls' accusations.  The academy continues to operate. It recently celebrated its 10th anniversary with a scandal-free story in Variety, which notes Winfrey's advice for the girls: “I want you to be president of your own life.”  Oprah turned a cancer patient on to junk science  If Winfrey becomes president, she would have enormous influence over American health care, including nominating the surgeon general and health secretary.  She's already selected “America's doctor.” That's Winfrey's term for Mehmet Oz, better known as Dr. Oz on her show, where he became famous for dispensing health advice in the mid-2000s — including the classic segment, “Everybody Poops.”  Today, as The Washington Post wrote, Oz has his own show and may be the country's most influential physician. And he regularly uses that influence to promote treatments with no scientific basis, including, literally, “magic” beans.  Oz may not necessarily be politically toxic — Trump appeared on his show during the 2016 campaign — but he's become a pariah in the medical community. Winfrey booted him from her media network two years ago after a group of physicians accused him of “quack treatments.”  Nor is he the only accused quack Winfrey has embraced: As the Guardian wrote, she's been blamed for boosting Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine crusade. And Winfrey has repeatedly plugged a mystical self-help system called “The Secret,” which claims that thinking good thoughts (and buying DVDs) can cure emotional, financial and physical problems.  Winfrey's first show about “The Secret” helped make a believer of Kim Tinkham, who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. She told Winfrey in 2007 that the system had inspired her to ignore her doctors, who told her she needed immediate surgery and treatment. “I've decided to heal myself,” Tinkham said.  Winfrey tried to talk her out of it. “I'm really happy the message, or certainly some of the message, is reaching mass consciousness,” she said. But Tinkham could think healing thoughts and still get a partial mastectomy.  The Washington Examiner reported that Tinkham died three years later.  Oprah caused a hamburger panic  Most people assume Winfrey — a backer of former president Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — would run as a Democrat. So she'd certainly need to win California, or Texas if she somehow ran as a Republican. Both happen to be big beef states. The latter was also the site of Winfrey's infamous beef lawsuit.  It began with an episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in 1996, amid widespread fears of so-called mad cow disease, a potentially fatal illness that humans can catch by eating certain organs of infected cattle.  Though the disease's spread had actually peaked a few years earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Winfrey brought a vegetarian activist onto her show — and this happened:  “You said this disease could make AIDS look like the common cold,” Winfrey told the activist, according to the Associated Press.  “Absolutely,” the activist replied.  “It has just stopped me from eating another burger!” Winfrey exclaimed, and her audience applauded.  Ranchers said beef prices crashed to a 10-year-low the next day.  “Oprah accused of whipping up anti-beef ‘lynch mob,’ ” CNN reported two years later, after a group of ranchers sued Winfrey under a Texas law against making “disparaging statements about perishable food products.”  A judge later downgraded the case to a defamation suit, but Winfrey was forced to relocate her show to Amarillo, where her fans packed the street outside the courtroom during the 1998 trial.  A jury eventually decided that Winfrey had not been trying to sabotage the beef industry. Her fans drank champagne outside the courthouse, and the talk show host refused once again to eat a burger.  Meat lovers remembered the spectacle for decades. “Why Does Oprah Continue to Bully Beef?” Beef Magazine wrote several years ago, and accused Winfrey of using her magazine to publish a hit piece against factory farms, of which the swing states boast more than a few.    Oprah Winfrey smiles after a jury rejected a lawsuit by Texas cattlemen, who claimed Winfrey's televised comments about mad cow disease caused the beef market to plummet and cost them millions of dollars. (Lm Otero/AP)  Oprah defended a fake book  With the beef wars behind her, Winfrey returned to her staple brand of positivity, sometimes tinged with tragedy.  In fall 2005, she brought author James Frey onto her show, who had written a harrowing memoir about overcoming alcohol and drug addiction.  “If you've ever had to live through this with somebody you love, here is a story that was written for you,” Winfrey told her viewers.  The rest of the segment was filled with passages from Frey's book, “A Million Little Pieces”:  Frey regaining consciousness in an airplane with no memory and missing teeth; Frey getting dental surgery without anesthesia; Frey freebasing cocaine and “snort[ing] glue.”  “I heave and it comes,” Frey recited from the book. “The burning vomit comes and comes again and again and again.”  Winfrey enthusiastically recommended “A Million Little Pieces” for her book club. It sold more than 2 million copies over the next two months, the New York Times reported.  Then reporters looked into Frey's stories and forced him to admit that he'd made many of them up.  Where he had written about getting high, driving a car into a police officer, fighting with the officer and spending three months in jail, police said, Frey had actually run his tire over a curb and politely paid bail for driving under the influence, CNN reported.  Where Frey wrote of being blamed for a teenager's fatal car accident, The Post wrote, the girl's parents could recall nothing of it.  Winfrey stood by the author, even after he admitted to exaggerating many stories. “What is relevant is that he was a drug addict who spent years in turmoil,” she told Larry King. “It seems to be much ado about nothing.”  Now critics turned on Winfrey, too. A Washington Post writer called her “deluded.” After a few days of humiliation, she invited Frey back on her show and, by common consensus, absolutely shredded him.  “You conned us all,” she told the squirming author. “That's a lie. It's not an idea, James. That's a lie.”  Still, the scandal did not end. The next year, Winfrey was back on King's show, denying that she had cruelly “annihilated” the author she once built up. In 2011, more than five years after the initial plug, Winfrey invited Frey onto her show yet again and apologized to him “for my lack of compassion.”  Some noted at the time that Frey had a new book coming out.  Oprah thinks some Americans need to die  Winfrey was promoting her most recent film, “The Butler,” in 2013 when she talked to the BBC about racism. The original interview seems to have disappeared online, but some of her words will live on:  “There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism,” Winfrey said, according to MSNBC. “And they just have to die.”  Her logic was celebrated by some — “Oprah Joins the Long Line of People Waiting for Old Racists to Die,” for example.  But right-leaning sites accused her of playing race politics to sell movie tickets.  Anticipating the deaths of any potential voters, even old racists, can't lend itself to a positive presidential campaign.  Oprah palled around with Harvey Weinstein  Speaking of “The Butler,” it was co-produced by Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul now accused of serial sexual assault. His fall from grace last year helped expose a culture of predation on women in Hollywood and inspired Winfrey's Golden Globes speech, which may in turn launch her presidential campaign.  But Weinstein's behavior was reportedly an open secret in the industry, which might make all the photos of Winfrey schmoozing around with him a political problem.  Conservatives are already gleefully cataloguing the pictures.  Unlike with Frey, Winfrey at least never publicly defended Weinstein after the accusations went public. Rather, she condemned his “hideous behavior.”  Still, her spokesman had to deny a TMZ report that Winfrey urged Weinstein to defend himself against the scandal. And in November, actress Kadian Noble told reporters that Weinstein had seduced her, in part, by introducing her to Winfrey and Naomi Campbell.  This led to a headline on Page Six: “Weinstein used Oprah and Naomi to seduce me.”  Fair or not, that's the stuff attack ads are made of.

"khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation Khloe Kardashian looks much unlike the reality star we’ve all come to know and love with a svelte new figure, platinum blonde locks and a radiating smile, but could her bombshell makeover be from her newfound confidence or a little help?  Screen Shot 2015-10-01 at 2.41.54 PM Kardashian pays celebrity fitness trainer Gunnar Peterson up to $130,000 a year for his services. “Khloé says it’s totally worth the cost,” the source said.  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation A source told Star magazine that Khloe has spent over $3 million to go from the “ugly duckling” of the Kardashian-Jenner clan into arguably the hottest of the sisters. “Khloé is more confident than she’s ever been,” a family insider said. “With all the work she’s having done, it’s surprising she has the time or money to do anything else!” So how did she do it?  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation According to the source, her biggest transformation is all in that little waist. Khloe has reportedly lost over 50 lbs. through diet and exercise. “Khloé has been working out constantly, and she’s even stopped partying and drinking to excess,” the source said.  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation-03 She’s also completely cut out junk food, opting for an expensive organic meal-delivery services or high-end food when she cooks herself. The 31-year-old also has replaced many of her meals with vitamins, supplement and diet pills, which have cost her dough.  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation But is it all diet and exercise—and a little glam—that turned her so hot? The source told Star, no. ""The buzz is that she’s had a nose job, breast implants, a Brazilian butt-lift and liposuction multiple times,” reveals a close pal. “She also got a gastric band to help her eat less. And none of that comes cheap — especially when you’re using the best of the best!”  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation Khloe also dropped $40,000 to have the fat on her thighs frozen. She’s also looking to have the same procedure done on her legs, butt, and stomach to “to sculpt away the fat that’s sitting on top of her muscles there.”  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation Kardashian also has had several noninvasive but costly cosmetic procedures, including Botox and other facial injections and fillers, tattoo removal—which she live-streamed on her website!—and skin-tightening laser treatments.  khloe-kardashian-plastic-surgery-cost-transformation-03 She’s also a spa addict and regularly gets facial peels, laser hair removal and body scrubs. In addition, she frequents the spray tanning bed every other day and, as the source said, “the price of her ever-changing hairstyles and hair color could pay someone’s mortgage!”",0

"Ongoing protests ahead of the G20 Summit has barred U.S. First Lady Melania Trump from leaving her hotel in Hamburg, Germany.  The First Lady’s spokesperson told reporters in Hamburg that police could not provide proper clearance for Trump to leave amid the protests, according to CNN. Trump was scheduled to visit a climate change center and take a river cruise with the spouses of other G20 members at the meeting, which takes place Friday and Saturday.

"Nicole Mary Kidman, AC (born 20 June 1967) is an Australian actress and producer.[4] She is the recipient of multiple awards, including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, a BAFTA, a SAG Award, the Silver Bear for Best Actress and a Cannes Film Festival special award.  Kidman began her acting career in Australia with the 1983 film Bush Christmas. Her breakthrough came in 1989 with the thriller Dead Calm and the television miniseries Bangkok Hilton. In 1990, she made her Hollywood debut in the racing film Days of Thunder, opposite Tom Cruise. She went on to achieve wide recognition with leading roles in the romantic drama Far and Away (1992), the superhero film Batman Forever (1995), the crime comedy-drama To Die For (1995), for which she won a Golden Globe Award, and the erotic thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). She received two consecutive Academy Award for Best Actress nominations for playing a courtesan in the musical Moulin Rouge! (2001) and the writer Virginia Woolf in the drama film The Hours (2002); she won the award for the latter, and received Golden Globes for both films.  Kidman continued to star in commercially successful films, including the horror-thriller The Others (2001) and the epic war drama film Cold Mountain (2003), as she achieved critical acclaim for roles in independent films, including the dramas Dogville (2003), Birth (2004), and Rabbit Hole (2010), for which she received a third Best Actress Oscar nomination, and the thriller The Paperboy (2012). Following a period of critical and commercial failures, Kidman earned a fourth Oscar nomination for playing a troubled mother in the biopic Lion (2016). She returned to television in 2017 with an acclaimed performance as a victim of domestic abuse in the HBO series Big Little Lies, for which she won a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series and Outstanding Limited Series as a producer.  Kidman has been a Goodwill ambassador for UNICEF since 1994[5] and for UNIFEM since 2006.[6] In 2006, Kidman was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia[7] and was the highest-paid actress in the motion picture industry for that year.[8] As a result of being born to Australian parents in Hawaii, Kidman has dual citizenship in Australia and the United States.[9] Kidman founded and owns the production company Blossom Films. Following her divorce from actor Tom Cruise, Kidman has been married to singer Keith Urban since 2006.  Early life [ edit ]  Kidman was born 20 June 1967 in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her father was Antony Kidman (1938–2014), a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author, who died of a heart attack in Singapore aged 75.[10][11][12][13] Her mother, Janelle Ann (née Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband's books and was a member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. Kidman's ancestry includes Irish, Scottish and English heritage.[14]  Being born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name ""Hōkūlani"". The inspiration for the name came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo,[15] but the name is also a commonly used Hawaiian name for girls, Hokulani meaning ""Heavenly Star"".[16]  At the time of Kidman's birth, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman's parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C.[17] The family returned to Australia when Kidman was four and her mother now lives on Sydney's North Shore. Kidman has a younger sister, Antonia Kidman, a journalist and TV presenter.[18]  Kidman attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls' High School. She was enrolled in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years.[19] She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.[20] Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, ""I am very shy – really shy – I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don't like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don't like going to a party by myself.""[21]  She initially studied at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. At Philip Street, Kidman studied alongside Naomi Watts who had attended the same high school.[19] She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People.[19] Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge.

Of Kidman's Golden Globe award-winning performance, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said ""[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse.

She received her second BAFTA[47] and fifth Golden Globe[48] nominations.

"advertising  by Molly Freeman  – on Jul 23, 2018  in Movie News  Warner Bros' upcoming Batgirl movie is rumored to be looking to hire Kristen Stewart - or someone like her - for the role of Barbara Gordon. The studio has been building up a shared cinematic universe in recent years featuring characters from the DC comics. Launched in Man of Steel, then truly kickstarted in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, the franchise has come to feature some of DC's most iconic heroes and villains. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Harley Quinn and more have been heavily featured in the films. Still, Warner Bros. has plenty more movies in development.  One such film revolves around Barbara Gordon aka. Batgirl, which was initially being developed by Joss Whedon. Then, Whedon stepped down from Batgirl earlier this year, and it was thought Barbara Gordon's solo movie would be delayed as a result. However, Warner Bros. is still moving forward with the Batgirl movie, hiring writer Christina Hodson, who wrote Paramount's upcoming Transformers spinoff Bumblebee and fellow DC movie Birds of Prey. Now, a new rumor offers insight into who Warner Bros. may be looking to cast as the titular superhero in Batgirl.  Related: Why Joss Whedon Left Batgirl Explained  DanielRPK, the Twitter user who has reported a number of DC-related rumors (though not all turned out to be true), tweeted over the weekend that Warner Bros. is looking to cast a ""Kristen Stewart prototype"" for Batgirl. His tweet further implies the studio may be looking to cast Stewart herself and, if that doesn't happen, they'll look for an actress in the same vein. It should be noted that this rumor comes from an unsubstantiated source and, as such, it should be taken with a major grain of salt. See the tweet below.  The tweet further confirms what was reported last week, that Batgirl won't be in Birds of Prey, which disappointed fans of the comics' female team-up. However, if Warner Bros. is beginning to talk about who they want to cast in the role of Barbara Gordon, that should indicate the studio is preparing to move forward with it. It's unclear where Hodson is at in the script-writing process, but if she's putting the finishing touches on Batgirl, finding a director and star are Warner Bros' next steps.  advertising  While this rumor indicates Warner Bros. is looking at Stewart or someone along those lines, it remains to be seen if that's truly who they'll cast. The Batgirl movie is still in the early stages of development. As previously stated, it's unclear if the studio even has a finished script yet, so plans may change. That said, at the very least, this rumor seems to reveal Warner Bros. is dedicated to bringing Batgirl to the big screen. With so many projects in various stages of development, it can be difficult to tell what the studio really plans to move forward with in the coming years. However, with four movies officially announced, and more getting closer to being ready to be officially confirmed, hopefully Warner Bros. will reveal more of their upcoming DC slate soon.  advertising  Source: DanielRPK  advertising  Give Screen Rant a Thumbs up!

"THE Kardashians have been savaged for parading around in fur coats and posting pictures of it on social media.  Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian were widely panned on Khloe’s Instagram account after posting the pictures of the trio in the coats on a trip to Cleveland.  Mix tape dropping in 2018 A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Apr 10, 2017 at 6:53pm PDT  Studio vibes! We dropping soon! About to be crazy! A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Apr 10, 2017 at 8:13pm PDT  It is not known if the coats are real of fake fur but Khole appeared to make no attempt to correct users criticising them for their controversial fashion choice.  Chloe Lattanzi was particularly upset.  Olivia Newton-John’s daughter reposted a pic of Kourtney in a white coat with a drink in hand.  RELATED: Kardashian ‘knew OJ was guilty’  Khloe previously declared she would never wear fur despite dropping her support for animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.  Khloe had been an ambassador for PETA and featured on billboards for the organisation.  However she cut ties to the group in 2012, when she discovered they were linked to a woman who attacked Kim with a flour bomb.  Blac Chyna Banned From Using 'Kardashian' Name Professionally 1:02 Blac Chyna has reportedly been banned from using the ""Kardashian"" name professionally. Ref: SPL1473126 030417 Video by: SNTV / Splash News  Khloe released a statement at the time.  “Hi dolls. I’m sure you all heard what happened to Kim last week (thank you SO much for the love and support you all showed her), and I just received word that the woman responsible has very close ties to PETA, despite PETA publicly stating otherwise,” the statement read.  “Not only has PETA lied to the public, but they have proved that they support this kind of behaviour.  “I’ve been a vocal supporter of PETA for a long time but I have also been very vocal about anti-bullying, so this was a huge disappointment for me.  “As you all know, I don’t condone violence and bullying and what happened last Thursday was just that.  “I am absolutely disgusted by their behaviour. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions — I personally don’t wear fur but that doesn’t mean I am going to force my views on anyone else, ESPECIALLY by violating them.  “I am a very proud sister right now, because Kim handled last week’s incident like a champ. She got cleaned up and was back out there in a matter of minutes. Go Kimmie!  “We all need to practice what we preach. I will still continue to NOT wear fur, but I will no longer support PETA. Bullying and harassment is NEVER a solution, and I won’t be a part of any organisation that thinks otherwise.”",0

"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.",1
"Despite rumors that Sandra Bullock secretly wed boyfriend Bryan Randall, a rep for the actress tells Us Weekly that there is no truth to that.  “They are not married,” the rep confirmed to Us of the 53-year-old Gravity star and her photographer beau. The couple, who have been dating for over two and a half years, have not yet tied the knot.  Back in November, a pal of Bullock’s talked to Us about her relationship with the Los Angeles-based photog and described him as “one of the nicest guys ever.” The friend added: “Bryan has fully stepped up and embraced the dad role. He is 100 percent there for Louis and Laila and wonderful with them in every way. Sandy feels incredibly fortunate and blessed that she is sharing the parenting journey with Bryan.”  The couple’s relationship comes after Bullock’s turbulent marriage to West Coast Choppers owner Jesse James. The two divorced in 2010 after James admitted to cheating on her with multiple women throughout their five-year union.  The Proposal star opened up to Vogue in October 2013 about her divorce: “We’re all where we’re supposed to be,” she told the mag at the time. “I am exactly where I want to be now. You can’t go backward. I’m not going backward. I’m grateful that I’m here, blessed to have what I have. Nobody can be prepared for anything.”  Bullock has two adopted children — a son, Louis, now 8, and daughter, Laila, now 6.

"Selena Gomez is officially sick of that same old love.  The singer is reportedly moving on from Justin Bieber , seemingly for real this time, and sources say she is ""thrilled"" about it.  ""Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship,"" a source told Us Weekly of the most recent split/time apart in March . ""Like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends's approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.""  When Justin and Selena rekindled their on-again, off-again romance last fall, her mom, Mandy Teefey, was openly unsupportive . In an interview shortly after the pair got back together, she said she was ""not happy"" with the relationship. But she then acknowledged that ""Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy. She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed. Selena is an adult and can make her own choices.""  Now, though, Selena has reportedly made the choice to say ""it ain't me"" for good, and move on from Justin. ""She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,"" the source told Us . ""She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.""  So what might that next chapter entail? For one thing, she has a new song launching on Friday, called ""Back 2 You"" from Season 2 of 13 Reasons Why. Fans have been under the impression that the jam was penned about the Biebs due to a recent curious Instagram. But based on this new information it may not quite be the case anymore.

"Is CAITLYN JENNER going into Celebrity Big Brother? by Hannah Mellin | 19 05 2017 Wowzas  Celebrity Big Brother are apparently willing to 'break the bank' in order to get Caitlyn Jenner on the next series of the show that's set to air later this year.  Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: ""The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  ""They know she’d be TV gold so they’re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn’s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.""  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly – she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait – and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,"" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.  ""But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.""  And staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.  ""My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she’s saying all these things.  ""I don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.""

"Since about 2015, America has become increasingly infatuated with complicated murder cover-ups. From HBO's The Jinx and the critically acclaimed Serial podcast to Netflix's Making a Murderer and the ongoing list of retellings of the OJ Simpson trial, we can't seem to get enough stories about the elaborate ins and outs of America's unjust justice system. Now, Netflix is banking on this trend with a new true crime docu-series titled The Keepers, which, according to Vanity Fair, will tell the mysterious story of Sister Cathy Cesnik's demise.  This isn't Netflix's first venture into true crime since the runaway success of Making a Murderer. The streaming service debuted the film Amanda Knox last year, which explored the fallout of an international criminal investigation on the eponymous subject's life. The movie received critical approval but didn't quite go viral in the way that speculation around the Avery family, the subjects of Making a Murderer, did following that series.  Some seem to be banking on The Keepers as the next big thing when it comes to true crime. The upcoming seven-part series is described as an investigation into the “unsolved murder of a nun and the horrific secrets and pain that linger nearly five decades after her death.” Sister Cathy was killed in Baltimore in 1969, with her case to this day remaining unsolved. Many speculate her killing was part of a Byzantine conspiracy related to sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.  ""The case returned to the spotlight in the 1990s when one of Sister Cathy’s former students—a woman only known as 'Jane Doe'—came forward to share her experience of horrendous sexual abuse by the high school’s chaplain,"" says Netflix's official description of the new show. ""Incredibly, 'Jane Doe' revealed she was also taken to Sister Cathy’s undiscovered body and told, 'See what happens when you say bad things about people.' Despite this and testimony from other victims and witnesses of abuse, no one was held accountable, and the story was largely unreported outside of Baltimore... Through conversations with dozens of friends, relatives, journalists, government officials and Baltimore citizens determined to uncover the truth, [director Ryan White] pieces together a story that goes beyond the death of a beloved Catholic school teacher to encompass clergy abuse, repressed memories and government and religious institutions that he says 'at best, dropped the ball over the last 45 years—and, at worst, covered it up.""  White is best known for his work on the marriage equality documentary The Cast Against 8 and the 2016 film Serena. The series is set to debut in full, as per Netflix tradition, on May 19.  By the way, Making the Murderer is slated for a season two, although details on that are few and far between. Cindy Holland, Netflix's VP of original content, said the following in January of this year: “The story is still ongoing, so you will see new episodes coming sometime this year as this story continues to unfold. We don’t know when for sure new episodes will be coming.”",1

"Is morning television on the brink of a major change? NBC chairman Andy Lack just signed Megyn Kelly to a major deal, and now the New York Post reports that there are rumors at the Peacock Network that the former Fox News star could take over for Savannah Guthrie on the Today show.  Though Kelly had taken pitches from ABC and CNN after leaving FOX, the promise of a daytime slot and a Sunday night show at NBC was too much for her to pass up. However, there may not be much to the Today rumors -- NBC insists that Guthrie, who is currently on maternity leave and recently signed a five-year deal with Today, isn't going anywhere.  ""We just signed Savannah to a massive deal that is longer than Megyn's,"" a high-level NBC source told Page Six. ""A lead anchor role at Today isn't part of the conversation for Megyn. The goal was simply to get someone of Megyn's talent and caliber through the door at NBC. We have not made a decision on her daytime slot. It is being discussed.""  It was rumored that Kelly was in deep talks with ABC to replace Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, though network officials have denied any such reports.  Kelly, who was FOX's No. 2 anchor for some time behind Bill O'Reilly, announced earlier this month that she would be leaving the network for NBC News. Her decision comes after Greta Van Susteren also departed FOX last fall in favor of MSNBC, leaving the network without its top two female anchors. Mediaite claimed that FOX had offered Kelly as much as $100 million to remain, though it seems money did not sway her final decision. She will be replaced by The Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson.  Also on FORBES:  ""I have grown up here and been given every chance a young reporter could ever ask for,"" she said while praising Rupert Murdoch and the FOX family.  Kelly spent 12 years with FOX, quickly climbing up the ranks and becoming a nationally recognized brand. President-elect Trump's attacks on her during the election cycle helped raise her profile even more. However, a possible Today gig is a far different animal than the 9 p.m. slot Kelly is used to, with audiences typically favoring entertainment stories and lighter subject matter as opposed to her traditional hard news.  Will Carlson, who has had an up-and-down career in front of the cameras, be an effective replacement at FOX? Will NBC push Guthrie out on Today in favor of Kelly? The answers to both questions will have far reaching impacts for their respective networks.  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save",0

Mellie is summoned to testify to the scandalous Air Force Two hijacking. She initially denies any involvement in the hijacking but information on the death of president Rashad, forces her to plead the fifth. In despair, Jake tries to blackmail Olivia into throwing Mellie under the bus—she ends up exposing the existence of B613 to Lonnie Mencken.

Sally Langston comes to their aid by breaking to the nation, through her televised show, on the existence of top secret organization, B613—a consequence that puts Cyrus and Jake's plans in jeopardy.",1

"Kathy Griffin is rescinding her apology over her controversial art piece depicting a decapitated President Trump.

The whole outrage was BS. The whole thing got so blown out of proportion.” pic.twitter.com/5PxNrQ2VSk — Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) August 29, 2017  Since she first posted an image of herself holding up what looked to be a bloodied head, Griffin has been fired from her annual CNN New Year’s Eve program, dropped from deals with advertisers like Squatty Potty and investigated by the Secret Service.  “I didn’t just lose one night on CNN. My entire tour was canceled within 24 hours because every single theater got all these death threats,” she added. “These Trump fans, they’re hardcore.”  When TV host Samantha Armytage then asked Griffin whether she thought she had crossed a line by sharing the graphic image, the veteran comic got defensive.  “No, you’re full of crap. Stop this,” she said. “Stop acting like my little picture is more important than talking about the actual atrocities that the president of the United States is committing.”  Griffin also noted that non-Republicans had turned on her as well, including Chelsea Clinton and Debra Messing, who had both tweeted to condemn her actions. But Griffin felt the impact most deeply when her close friend and longtime New Year’s Eve cohost Anderson Cooper disavowed her with a single tweet.  “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,” he wrote at the time. “It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”  According to The Cut, four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out to Griffin repeatedly in subsequent days to make sure she was OK; Cooper didn’t reach out to Griffin until August 10th. Via a series of text messages, she soon told him their friendship was over, The Cut reports.  Cooper told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in July that the pair are “still friends,” and that he hopes “she bounces back.”",1

"Controversial self-help group Nxivm has suspended operations following the high-profile arrests of Smallville actress Allison Mack and group co-founder Keith Raniere on sex trafficking and forced labor charges.  According to a message posted on Nxivm’s website, “we are suspending all Nxivm/ESP enrollment, curriculum and events until further notice.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The message was posted sometime after Mack’s April arrest, but it was not clear exactly when.  The message continues: “While we are disappointed by the interruption of our operations, we believe it is warranted by the extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time. We continue to believe in the value and importance of our work and look forward to resuming our efforts when these allegations are resolved.”  Nxivm, which has not responded to numerous requests for comment from PEOPLE on the allegations against Mack and Rainere, has been described by at least one former member as a “cult.”  Mack was charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. The actress, best known for her years-long role as Chloe Sullivan on The WB’s Smallville, is facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all of her charges.  Raniere faces the same charges and potential prison sentence. Both he and Mack have pleaded not guilty.  Federal investigators have accused Mack of recruiting women into a sub-group of NXIVM purported to be a female mentorship group to address their weaknesses but was actually a group created by Raniere that allegedly took advantage of women sexually.  “The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, alleged in a statement issued at the time of Mack’s arrest.  Allison Mack Matt Baron/BEI/REX/Shutterstock  Nxivm is based out of Albany, New York, and has been the subject of scrutiny from both law enforcement and journalists as it came under fire from Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose estranged daughter, India, joined the group in 2011.  Oxenberg first opened up to PEOPLE last year about how she believed India had been “brainwashed” by Nxivm.  • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.  In the fall, India posted on Facebook that she was “absolutely fine, great actually [and] I would never put myself or the people I love into any danger.”  For the past two decades, an estimated 16,000 people have paid as much as $3,400 for an executive coaching workshop offered by Nxivm, which promises to take participants on a journey of personal discovery and development, according to previous PEOPLE reports.  The criminal complaint against Raniere — known as “Vanguard” to his followers — alleged that he encouraged the formation of a secretive subgroup within Nxivm called “Dominus Obsequious Sororium,” (DOS) in which women were coerced into serving as sex slaves to their male masters.  Keith Raniere  The complaint, which was previously obtained by PEOPLE, outlines how authorities believe the women were forced to turn over “collateral” — or potentially-damaging personal information or materials, such as nude photographs, with which they later could be blackmailed.  The women allegedly victimized by Mack allegedly believed their “collateral” would be released if they did not engage in sexual activity with Raniere, the statement on Mack’s arrest alleges.  It was the scandal that rocked America’s most storied political family and changed the course of presidential history.

The complaint against Raniere additionally alleges the women were branded with Raniere’s initials, as he “alone forms the top of the pyramid as the highest master.”  A cauterizing pen was used to make the permanent marks near each person’s pubic region, the complaint alleges.  In statements previously posted to Nxivm’s website, Raniere said all involved in DOS were consenting adults and that Nxivm was not involved in what he called a “sorority.”  In the fall, the group denounced a New York Times article about them as “a criminal product of criminal minds.”  Mack and Raniere are scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 1.",1
"The upcoming season of “Dancing with the Stars” is shaping up to be star-packed.  We hear ABC is actively in talks to land Caitlyn Jenner for the 26th season, which will feature just 10 athletes for an unusually short four-week season.  If the 68-year-old Olympic gold medalist signs on the dotted line, she’ll be the third member of her family to slip on their dancing shoes for cameras.  Stepdaughter Kim Kardashian competed in the seventh season and placed 11th in the competition. Rob Kardashian competed in the 13th season and became the first runner-up.  While recruiting the trans activist could be a good idea for ratings, we’re told insiders are worried about potential backlash because of her political views. Jenner has been confronted before over her opinions. In June 2017, Amanda Seales took her to task at Katy Perry’s “Friends and Family: Dinner with Discourse” event.  When asked about the casting news, ABC told Page Six in a statement, “We do not confirm or comment on casting rumors. We’ll be announcing our cast closer to our premiere date.” Season 26 is expected to premiere this spring.  Jenner’s rep simply said, “Not true.”",0

"CLOSE From the highly-anticipated ""She-Ra"" reboot to Robin Wright's reign on ""House of Cards,"" here's what's coming to Netflix this November. USA TODAY  The final season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" debuts with Robin Wright as Claire Underwood, the new President of the United States after her husband's resignation from the position. ""House"" is just one of the many series that examines the drama and comedy surrounding politicians in power. Here are a few more of our favorite political television shows. (Photo: David Giesbrecht, Netflix)  Netflix is dead. Long live Netflix.  This weekend marks the end of an era for the omnipresent streaming service, with the debut of the final season of ""House of Cards.""  Canceling ""Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" (its seventh and final season is due in 2019) officially closes the streaming service's first chapter of programming, five years after it began. It was a time when the TV sky seemed limitless – no shows seemed to get canceled, old favorites were constantly being saved and streaming was a playground for writers and directors to experiment. And always, at least on the outside, it seemed to work.  It was an era when Netflix sought a handful of high-quality, high-talent series to lure new subscribers. It was the era when the Kyle Chandler-starring ""Bloodline"" and the Wachowski sibling extravaganza ""Sense8"" were among the service's top offerings because of their pedigrees alone (both series eventually were canceled in early seasons). It was a time when we thought Netflix was just trying to become HBO.  But that was 2013. And maybe 2014 and 2015. In the week ending Nov. 2, Netflix released eight new projects, including documentaries, comedy specials and movies, more than any breathing human could likely watch in a weekend. When the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, for the first time, Netflix had more than HBO.  The streaming service has spent billions of dollars on original programming in every genre, from Food Network-style baking competitions (""Sugar Rush"") to foreign language sci-fi (""Dark"") to preteen sobfests (""Alexa and Katie""). Sure, it's still fun and experimental. But just like traditional TV networks (whose audience size is made public, unlike Netflix), the streaming service is more frequently canceling shows that don't stick, including Marvel's ""Luke Cage"" and acclaimed true-crime parody ""American Vandal.""  Paris Berelc and Isabel May on ""Alexa & Katie."" (Photo: Adam Rose/Netlix)  In this new world of Netflix, ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" seem quaintly out of date, just five years after they broke ground.  Almost from the moment it began unveiling original programming – known until then for reruns of series like ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Breaking Bad"" and mail-order DVDs – Netflix changed TV. It started quietly with shows like ""Lilyhammer"" but Netflix's big coming-out moment was ""Cards,"" a drama about a ruthless politician directed by Oscar nominee David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey (then a powerhouse celebrity). It was exactly the kind of dark, serialized, twisty series that thrived in the new binge-streaming paradigm, and it became a phenomenon.  Not long after, prison dramedy ""Orange"" arrived, looking, sounding and feeling like nothing else on TV, including a cast with a wide range of races, body types, socioeconomic statuses, gender identities and sexual orientations. It told women's stories at a time in television when most other programmers were trying to find the next Walter White.  This image released by Netflix shows Taylor Schilling, left, and Uzo Aduba in a scene from ""Orange Is the New Black."" (Photo: Paul Schiraldi, AP)  ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" were showered with Emmy nominations (though their wins were few) and became the face of the streaming frontier that Netflix set out to dominate. But the streaming service doesn't need them anymore.  Sure, both shows have declined sharply in quality, which would seemingly warrant cancellation, but the reasons for their demise go beyond just their age: Netflix now has so many other options that scratch the same itches.  More: New on Netflix in November: 'House of Cards,' 'Narcos,' and plenty of Christmas films  The service has spent hundreds of millions to woo Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy from TV networks, both creators known for making shows with diverse casts and, especially Murphy, for experimenting with form. Want politics? Netflix has also signed Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal. It has dark dramas and anti-hero shows by the dozen, from ""Ozark"" to ""The Punisher."" It won 23 Emmys this fall (tying perennial leader HBO), plus SAG Awards and Golden Globes aplenty. If you need to see its influence, look no further than the recently released ""Making a Murderer Part 2,"" which spends ample time outlining just how much the first chapter of the Netflix doc affected the media and the criminal justice system.  When Netflix launched original programming, it needed big, buzzy shows to make noise. But the streaming service is now one gigantic monster, hoarding hundreds of big, medium and little shows that cater to every possible interest. Want a baking show mixed with the a sense of the macabre? Try ""The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell."" Want a cop comedy with a cast as seemingly random as Tony Danza and Josh Groban? There's ""The Good Cop."" Want to see pretty houses? Enjoy ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes.""  Christine McConnell on ""The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell."" (Photo: Netflix)  Netflix's brand is everything, and its audience is everyone. ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" represent a tiny sliver of that vast canvas.  Viewers' main interest in the final season of ""Cards"" is how the show moves on after Spacey was fired after allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Had the actor not fallen from grace so publicly, ""Cards"" might have premiered its final episodes even more quietly. With so much else on Netflix's welcome screen, ""Cards"" simply isn't essential viewing anymore. On its release day this year it has to compete with a lost Orson Welles movie, a Mike Judge comedy special and two documentaries. Not to mention a Julia Roberts series a few clicks away on Netflix competitor Amazon Prime.  With every passing day, Netflix executives and their checkbooks turn their attention somewhere new. Its biggest priority now seems to be conquering the film industry. And the streamer certainly seems to be making progress on that front. It's impossible to think of a new series this year that's generated the same adoration and hype that greeted its mini-rom-com film slate, from teen sensation ""The Kissing Booth"" to the by-the-numbers ""Set It Up."" Film pundits predict that Netflix might get its first best-picture Oscar nomination for Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma,"" due in theaters this month and on Netflix in December.  So here's to ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" and the televised revolution they helped begin. It's been a wild five years. It's both exciting and terrifying to wonder what will happen in five more.

"They are two of the top models in the world known for rocking edgy couture on the runway.  So it may be a bit of a surprise that Bella and Gigi Hadid would opt for something much more casual on their latest outing together even if it was a rather momentous occasion.

"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.""",0
